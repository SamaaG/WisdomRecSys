Review Text :
Brand was definitely one of the redeeming factors of staying at the Monte Carlo with a group on a strict budget -- good food was actually right there under our noses. Ballers for only a night just two friends and I dined here our last night to cap off our vacation in style. It was about time, too, because I had enough of McDonalds and Rubios from the Monte Carlo food court.We strolled down to the lobby and got a table with ease from the foxy hostesses around 7pm. Brand is both a steakhouse and adjoining small lounge, with the steakhouse dining room separated from the casino floor by only a waist-high counter. I was already numb to the casino funk, so it didn't bother me at all. We were seated right along the counter, a prime location for people watching.Steak, steak, steak, and more beautiful steak. I love steak and I might go ahead and say my 8oz filet mignon was probably in the top 20 best steaks I've ever had. They have all kinds of cuts, with or without the bone, and tons of sides to boot. Not quite the selection of beef at Alfred's in San Francisco, but pretty good.The dinner special for two seemed like a good idea, but sadly, by the day after Valentine's Day they were out of it. My two companions split a hefty bone-in porterhouse and added on three sides ($9 a piece or 3 for $23).For appetizers, we collectively split two cesar salads, kobe carpaccio, tuna tartare and a jumbo shrimp cocktaill. The cesar was good with whole pieces of romaine with homemade herb croutons. The kobe carpaccio was thin and buttery with capers, shaved parmesan reggiano and a delightfully bitter frisée thinly dressed in what tasted like a nice peppery balsamic, with a few slices of subpar brioche toast. The tuna tartare was mixed with crisp jicama and it came with brioche toast and a bed of watercress. So far, so good.My filet mignon was medium and had a proportionately flavorful seasoned exterior. Their porterhouse came with a bone about the size of my forearm and two sauces. Steaks come a la carte, so be sure to order something to go alongside. For $25 you can add on lobster to your steak, but it isn't a lobster tail! It's like a lobster in a thick cheesy, buttery gravy sauce. Still good, still plump, it just took us by surprise. For sides we opted for the asparagus, mushrooms and the hashbrowns. The asparagus was my fave, perfectly tender with a white dipping sauce. The mushrooms were earthy and good and the hashbrowns looked like little triangle-cut club sandwiches with bacon in the center with sour cream on the side; I didn't get to eat one because I was so full, but they made for great leftovers.Brand isn't obscenely opulent nor expensive like many restaurants in Vegas. I felt it was a great value for the money, the staff was professional and attentive and it was easy to walk in without a reservation. In addition to the two steaks, lobster, three sides, three appetizers, two salads, we had one non-alcoholic beverage, two cocktails and one glass of wine, and our bill was $240. With tip, we spent $100 per person and left stuffed.Now, they do have one special I would like to see someone order... Brand has a 120oz steak, meant to feed six people, for $267. If one person can finish it by themselves, it's on the house! AMAZING!I think I found the only reason to stay or even visit the Monte Carlo.http://bit.ly/MDJHE1Why yes, that is a 120 oz Porterhouse cured in bacon for 48 hours. When I saw the damn thing, the only words that I could muster up to descibe this masterpiece was "Meat Tower"Besides the Meat Tower, other items on the menu looked and smelled just as delicious. The full bar satisfied those who are on liquid diets and the beautiful decor and waitresses kept your mind off being hungy, that is until the Meat Tower came by your table.I think I just found Ron Swanson's new favorite restaurant. If you don't know who Ron Swanson is, I feel bad for you son.http://bit.ly/x3SgoJOK, maybe you might be at the Monte Carlo to see the Jabbawockeez.PS. The Meat Tower is meant to be shared.This is in the Monte Carlo. It's way in the back of the casino and is darkly lit. Looks very business-like.They had a special deal that weekend. Three course meal for $37... YES, PLEASE.They did give us a salad... Caesar... and it was good. APPETIZER: TUNA TARTARE - Pine Nuts, Asian Pear, Toast PointsIt was delicious. I'm so glad I got it because it was a good size.MAIN COURSE: CHILEAN SEA BASS oh YEAH! This is the good stuff. Especially... the sauce! My fiance got the filet mignon and kept dipping it in my sauce (that's what she said). It was really good. Very savory and the fish mixed with it. YES. LOBSTER SAUCE.SIDES:BAKED MAC & CHEESE - This was alright. It's not truffled... but it was still good. VERY Big. Share it.GRILLED ASPARAGUS - Standard. Dip it in my lobster sauce! :DDESSERT:NY STYLE CHEESECAKE THIS... WAS HUGE. Don't expect the Costco size slice. This is HUGE. You can share with this four people :/ After a big hearty meal. STRAWBERRY BAKED ALASKAMY favorite. It was like a strawberry shortcake really.SERVICE:Very good and attentive. Dropped my fork... got a new one instantly. We had to wave at them several times, but it was fine. We got our bill and on our way. OVERALL:If there is a deal, grab it.This place was delicious. Even wotuout the deal. Get the Strawberry Baked Alaska!From the Light Group; creators of some of the most impressive mega clubs, ultra lounges, and restaurants in Vegas, Miami, and Dubai so yes, it's impressive, contemporary, and trendy.  Smoke and mirrors.Bottom line, you're paying for beautiful plates of "contemporary" cuisine unjustified by the quality of the ingredients.  In other words, want to impress a non foodie, this is your kind of place.To start, the "Hot Rocks" (Japanese style of cooking thin slices of beef on super heated stones), fun but it's USDA choice at best and a chewier sirloin cut.  Not much internal fat, marinated in an acidic ponzu, olive oil mix causes the protein to tighten up even further.   Fun and visually cool but misses the mark. The tuna tartare, much better.  Deconstructed at service, mix everything up to enjoy.  Everyday sushi grade tuna mixed with well toasted pine nuts, crisp Asian pair and some soy with a hint of horseradish on toast points.  Refreshing and texturally interesting.For mains, no mention is made on the quality or aging of the beef.  It appears to be USDA top choice, not prime.  Steaks are well trimmed.  Cooking temperatures off.  The tomahawk rib eye cooked mid well when ordered mid rare (twice) was OK.  Not as tender as it should be.  Good bitterness from the wood burring grill but lacking intense beef flavor of a well aged piece of beef.  The menu says 24oz but a lot of that weight is the bone.  Maybe 12oz of actual beef.  The bone in Brooklyn fillet is OK.  Cooked to temperature.  The bone, slightly cut away from the beef for looks fails to impart sufficient flavor as dry aged versions of the same cut.  Pet peeve:  they put a pat of COLD butter on top of the steak.  Am I supposed to rub it around in the beef drippings and make my own sauce?Correct sides.  No real standouts.Good happy hour where you can try scaled down versions of the starters for $9.Good wine list.  High Vegas resort pricing.Smoke and mirrors a bad thing?  Hey, you're in Vegas aren't you?It was a bit empty when I got to Brand, so I was a little worried about how legit it is.  Coworker and I each decided to start with the French Onion Soup, and share the Penne Pasta and the NY Sirloin.When the Onion Soup came, it looked pretty glorious.  Super thick layer of cheese!  Whatever the 4 types of cheeses are, it tasted awesome.  Not much in terms of the "croutons" but I like it that way.  The soup itself is intensely rich, and they say they caramelize the onions for 24 hours and hell, I believe them.  The only thing was that it was very salty.  That might turn some people away, but it didn't bother me too much.The steak was a perfect medium rare to medium.  Very nice seasoned crust too.  I think the best part about the steak was the sauces that it came with.  Loved the red wine worcestershire sauce.  It's like the grown up version of your A1!  The peppercorn sauce has a nice touch too, but definitely went with the red wine worcestershire much more often.The Penne Pasta looked really simple but it is one of the better pasta dishes I've had in Vegas.  Came  prosciutto, peas, and truffle sprinkles in a rich parmesan cream sauce.  Not much in terms of quantity for the truffle, but just the sprinkles are enough.  Pasta's also cooked to a perfect al dente!Service-wise, our main server was great.  However, the other wait-staff looked like they are PO all the time haha.  Generally in Vegas, especially on the south end of the strip, I'd go to Gallagher's but now, Brand is a strong consideration for next time!I can count the number of times I paid less than $100 for a nice steak dinner on the Strip...yeah, one. This is the first one actually. A group of us went here on a Wednesday night since they were offering 20% off on dinner for locals. We got there earlier than the rest of the group so, we decided to have a few drinks at the bar which was offering 50% off bottles + the 20% locals discount.  We ended up with a bottle of Veuve Clicquot for only $35! Oh my word!I was debating whether to split a Tomahawk or the 40oz Ultimate Steak with somebody. In the end, I'm glad I listened to his decision - if the 24oz Tomahawk was hard to finish, what more the 40oz steak? The price can't be beat at $51 for a 24oz steak. The quality and flavor of the steak were not compromised though. We also got a lobster tail, garlic mashed potatoes and cream spinach.Anton's Tomahawk Rib Eye:24oz rib eye cooked medium just the way we like it. It was tender, juicy and flavorful. Careful with the huge bone though. Regular price: $51. 5/5Maine Lobster Tail:For an additional $25, you get a nice lobster tail with crushed Ritz crackers. The lobster tail is already split and sliced. 4/5Cream Spinach:The Boursin cheese makes a world of difference. This is not your boring cream spinach. Super creamy and delicious. 5/5At the end of the night, we spent about $140 for steak, a bottle of champagne, 2 sides and a lobster tail. I was so full and completely satisfied. Definitely cheap for what we got. GREAT VALUE!  They also have a 3-course prix fixe menu for $39 and happy hour from 5-8pm.Great atmosphere, great food, and great prices...but on Wednesdays, it's a RIDICULOUS deal!!Wednesdays are 50% wine bottles....and if you are local, you get 20% your entire bottom line...INCLUDING your already 50% discounted wine!!Ex : Veuve Cliquot ($85). My favorite champagne under $50 (in stores)....On Wednesdays, bottles are half price, and with local's discount, it's an extra 20% off the bottom line, so it only costs around $35!! GREAT deal...since you can't even go to Total Wine for that price most days!Started off with the Complimentary bread...we had to request it for some reason. It is sweet and slightly sticky...good stuff!I shared the 24oz Tomahawk Ribeye ($51) and Maine Lobster Tail stuffed with Ritz Crackers ($25). This is THE best non-aged Ribeye I've had so far, and the price was CHEAP! After the 20% off for locals, it's a $40 steak!! The lobster was very TENDER and flavorful, and the Ritz Cracker stuffing in the tail was delicious!  One of the most enjoyable tails I've had in town, and for a $20 bill after the discounts :PFor sides, the Cream Spinach ($9) with Boursin Cheese. I love Boursin Cheese, so this was an easy win for me!!  The Mashed Potatoes ($9) with Roasted Garlic as well...good amount of garlic flavor...tasty!  They didn't blow me away, but they are solid choices.So even at face value, this is a great steakhouse on the strip.  Are there better ones in town?  Absolutely, but considering their very fair prices, AND THEN the Wine Wednesday and Locals discounts, it's a STEAL of a deal!Check out the pics :Vegas is over-priced for it's artificial fanciness and being from LA, I'm done with the gimmicky steak places.  But WOWers place was unexpectedly great!  We got what everybody gets, the tomahawk ribeye (med rare) with lobster tail (ritz mush was grainy but I don't think you're suppose to really eat it eat it), Caesar salad and mac and cheese.  There was barely any room thanks to their large plates, but everything was delicious!  I would definitely come here again next time.  Nice dinner without a huge financial burden.The only odd thing was I asked for tobasco and they gave me those tiny hotel/airplane bottles in a dish.  None of them were wrapped/sealed and had various levels.  I really think there is someone in the back knee deep in tiny empty tobasco bottles refilling them with a huge $1.99 tobasco bottle.  They must have a really small funnel and the patience of a leprechaun.  Classy!Located in the middle of Monte Carlo Casino, Brand is easy enough to find :)  Although this is a typical upscale steak house it has Vegas style open seating meaning you can sit along a half wall and watch people go or have people watch you eat as they walk by, not my preference.  Fortunately there are more secluded booths farther back in the restaurant.Decorated in dark wood with dim lighting Brand certainly looks the part of "steakhouse" There is a full service bar and lounge area as well which showcases half priced apps and reduced drinks for Happy Hour.We ordered the Prime Rib and added a lobster tail.  The normal cut 12 ounces was $35 and the lobster tail was an additional $25.  I ordered the large cut which was 16 ounces and cost $39.00.  The prime was tender, juicy, cooked perfectly, seasoned well and just darn Yummy.  Au Jus and creamy horseradish came along with the prime.  The lobster tail was about 6-8 ounces and also steamed perfectly.  Accompanied by melted butter, there was a hidden surprise inside the lobster tail shell was a cornbread type stuffing flavored with lobster bits.  The stuffing was scrumdelicious and made for a perfect bite paired with the sweet lobster.Sides averaged $9-12 each and they had a special of 3 for $25. We tried the loaded potato, mushrooms and green beans.  The potato and mushrooms were good, but the green beans were way to "Al Dente" for us, our server swapped the beans out for creamed spinach.All the sides were good and the mushrooms in particular were very good :)Although we didn't have room for desert, we did look at the menu and prices are only $10 per desert so don't worry about desert breaking the bank if you have room to order some.Service was prompt and friendly without the "attitude" you sometimes receive in more expensive eateries.  I highly recommend trying Brand if you are looking for a good steakhouse in Vegas.  Brand has quality food and service and very reasonable prices to boot!View of the casino, good music, classy seating. I had been here many times not particularly memorable. THIS TIME, was a great one. I enjoyed being here to celebrate a birthday.  I was comfortable.  AJ gave us excellent service. We had were on a time crunch and did not have to worry about it at all.  The hot rocks was thee highlight of my meal!  Deliciously flavored, really wished there was more of it to eat!  I love anything I get to cook myself. 3 seconds on each side perfection. Told my boyfriend I'd find him a rock outside that he could cook on for his bday gift! =PWe split a bone in ribeye... Man what a bone!  I could grab it with my whole hand and just take a bite out of the steak if I wanted. (Secretly wanted to). It was cooked perfectly on the inside. Extra charred on the outside.  If this is your thing, I would recommend it.  However it isn't my thing.  I felt like it countered the fact that I wanted my one cooked medium. As we did share we also surfed our turf.  Good firm lobster tail.  The sides were smaller than I am used to.  I did think this was great because we can get more variety and still finish our food.  Mac n cheese, mashed potato, and green beans. Enough for the 3 of us to share. All really great. Mac n cheese was the best out of the 3. Birthday candle in the ice cream to top it all off!  It was a good dinner.After an eventful first day in Las Vegas; a day where everything that was planned seemed to fall by the wayside due to timing, Brand Steakhouse saved the day.After our original dinner reservations at PRIME fell through due to timing, we decided to give the Brand Steakhouse downstairs a try.  Despite many reviews talking about the lack of quality restaurants within the Monte Carlo and they do not recommend this place, I decided to heed the advice of one my co-workers and give the place a try.  We originally made reservations for 6:45 but decided to pop down around 6 to see if anything was available beforehand.  I am glad we did because the place was relatively empty and we were seated immediately which saved us time and allowed us to not rush as much to ensure we made our show on time.  Our server John was great, real down to earth, helpful in making suggestions and telling us of the specials for the evening and staying on top of everything.  We aren't drinkers so they quickly ushered away our unused wine glasses and our iced teas and water came out quickly.  Being as this was not the intended restaurant I went in with no knowledge of the menu but quickly settled on the 8oz. Filet Mignon (cooked well done) and a loaded baked potato on the side.  Yes; I know, well done and Filet do not go together but I don't like the pink and bloody steaks and am often told my steak more resembles a hockey puck or shoe leather as opposed to actual meat.  Well rest assured, Brand cooked the steak well done and it was still full of flavor and absolute perfect for my liking.  This to me is the surefire sign of a good restaurant, being able to adapt to a customers wishes and still deliver a great product.  I know a few other restaurants who could learn a thing or two from this place.  Both the steak and potato were delicious and quickly devoured.My wife, who tends to eat much lighter and healthier than I, went with the crispy chicken.  This came sitting atop a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and she seemed to also really enjoy the dish.  We decided to go with the New York Cheesecake with berry compote for dessert.  This was quite a large slice for the price and being as we were sharing it, the size was quite adequate to close out the meal.  The food, service and ambiance were all amazing and for the price this place would be hard to beat on the strip.  For 2 meals, 2 drinks and dessert our bill was $113 bucks and after a generous tip we got out having spent significantly less than we would had if our original plans did not fall through.  I would definitely recommend this place and would love to come back here again.

On November 10, I had a "LONG" day!I flew to LA (Los Angeles Airport) and meet with some people for a task development. I was only down there for only 2.5 hours without eating anything. Then with the next three days off from my job, I immediately flew to Las Vegas for another assignment..."party"!After arriving McCarran Airport and becoming dark quickly at 4pm, I drove down Maryland Parkway and saw a huge "Happy Hour Special" banner in front of L &L. on Tropicana Ave. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OJofPDW-G_OPVKz84Fhbxg?select=yoqpk5PpbUZRWrHX5cqf1gThe HH special happens from 4-11pm (closing time). For $4.95, I get the Chicken Katsu meal with two scoops of rice and two scoops of Macaroni Salad. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OJofPDW-G_OPVKz84Fhbxg?select=Ct_IsOfK0QWaDPD1uykBIA  Drink is not included with the meal. So I chose a can of Hawaiian Sun: Lychee Green Tea for an additional $1.19. It has been a while since I've had any Hawaiian meal. The meal was ok..Credit card is accepted. And I know I can get L & L back home. But the price is right, plus I was starving after a long day!

I stopped in here this morning because I love grits.  Usually I just have grits as a side when I'm at Denny's or get a small bowl at Red Rock's buffet but this is the real thing.  I got a grits bowl.  I chose the three slices of bacon and I got cheddar cheese on the top.  I asked for the egg sunny side up.  It also came with a choice of toast or biscuit and I got whole wheat toast.  I left the counter carrying my coffee cup and within a relatively short time, a young woman brought my breakfast to me.  Wow, was it good!  Break the yolk, and let it run into the grits along with the butter I had already put in.  Wonderful.The restaurant is small--nine tables.  There was a couple with two small children at the other table--I hit a quiet morning--and they were visiting from California.  That's the kind of homey atmosphere the place has.Adam, the young man taking orders today, was a very pleasant guy! This is stick to your ribs down home cooking.  What that means is that breakfast was heavy laden with carbs so I'll have to do extra at my gym workout this afternoon.  Oh the horror, but it was so worth it.Thanks to Sylvia and Nelson Q. for their heads up on this great place.MmMmmM Chicken and Waffles!I don't order fried chicken often...usually it's just not my dish.  A "soulless" piece of dried up, battered bird with no love.  First bite, deep fried grease drippin down your chin...you get the idea.Thankfully, Gritz Cafe is different...in a GREAT way!Chicken & Waffles ($10.95). Gotta be some of the BEST fried chicken I've ever had! So much flavor...so juicy...and everything tastes great with Maple syrup poured on it!  Batter has spices and flavor hiding inside, with a nice slightly crispy-crunchy consistency.Waffle was good, not mind blowing good, but combining it with the chicken takes it up to another level!  Pretty basic waffle, but the chicken is where it's at!I plan to be back to try the Catfish!  That's actually what I came here for initially, but breakfast moods swayed me!  Too bad they close so early...3pm!  But then again, I don't see myself coming here by myself at 10pm either LOLCome get some!There are certain places I refuse to go to especially alone. I'm always up for some good Southern cooking but if the area looks like I could get shot any time then, forget it! In fact, there's a place a block away from Gritz Cafe that supposedly has good catfish and a group of Yelpers actually went a few months ago. I saw pictures of the place and decided it would be smart for me not to go even as a group. I'm glad to say that Gritz Cafe is a clean, safe place with good food.They only have a few tables. The service was superb and absolutely friendly. The food was served fresh and hot. We got catfish with grits and mac and cheese, and chicken and waffles. Their sweet tea was less sweet compared to most places that serve sweet tea.Catfish:Seasoned, battered in corn meal and fried to perfection. Put some hot sauce and it's perfect! I've had terrible catfish in the past and I was also raised to not eat catfish since "it's a bottom feeder that eats garbage" so for me to like this speaks highly of this place. 5/5Chicken and Waffles:I'm a Roscoe's fan so I would have to compare their chicken and waffles with GC's. GC has 4 huge chicken wings. Roscoe's lets you choose what parts you want. BUT GC's fried chicken was just as delicious. Super hot (temperature-wise), crunchy and well-seasoned. As for the waffles...well, they were marginal. Nothing special...Roscoe's waffles are sooo much better. Even the guy at the next table thinks so! 3.5/5

The only thing I can rave about here is the portabello fries- they're incredible. Thick slices of mushroom, lightly battered, and served with a great creamy dipping sauce. Definitely start your meal off with an order.But everything else had issues, including the service.Lobster bisque was delicate to the point of bland, and tasted more of clams than lobster. Wedge salad was fine, bleu cheese crumbles were so small that it was hard to eat on the salad and most was left behind on the plate. Lamb chops were cooked perfectly to medium-rare, as ordered, and nicely seasoned, but were very fatty, with a thick rind of gristle on each piece. Service was polite, but I don't like how I was charged to purchase a side when I subbed a vegetable for the included potato. Server said there'd be a small fee, which I'm fine with- instead, I was rung up for a full side order and simply didn't receive one with my meal. If you can't do substitutions, just say so. I guess they're trying to pad the bill since there were only four tables on a Friday night.

I am struggling to give this four stars.  Really solid 3+ and I'm feeling generous. Had a Blue Burger.  It was good. They certainly didn't skimp on the meat, the blue or the fixins.  The hamburger was a bit dry however and I wasn't blown away by the service or the food.  I may go back, but I'm in no big hurry.Not really noteworthy.

Ok -- see below referenced wet behind the ears server... I popped in here today for a quick sandwich -- it was late, 1:20.  So I figured it would be an easy place to grab a quick bite.  Since I was alone, I headed into the bar -- barstools... -- but wet-ears (asian kid, spiky hair, glasses) directed me into the dining room where there was only 1 table of 2 occupied...  "ugh they're doing work in the bar..."  "Sit here, there's more ac" (it was goosebump cold and completely unnecessary).   When I asked him where the ladies room was, he replied "(beavis-y)  uhhhuhh, they're doing work in the men's room, so you'll have to hold your nose if you want to go to the bathroom."   Since we both knew that I needed to go to the restroom, I ordered quickly -- slider combo and an arnold palmer.   "uhhuh, our uh lemonade thing isn't working so we don't have any"    I ordered water.  Then five minutes later, he sheepishly returned,  holding glass,  "uhhuh, I asked the bartender if he could make lemonade so if you don't like it, no problem..."  (lemon, water, sugar -- yeah, tough) -- not even a full glass, then add iced tea.  Hard.  Real hard.15 minutes after that...after watching him chat away with hostess/manager/whatever -- he comes skulking back to the table "um, I have a confession... we don't have any brisket."   It's been 20 minutes -- and he's just now telling me no brisket -- are you kidding me?   So, I ask him, as I survey the entire empty dining room -- if he thought that his service, the poor communication with the kitchen, the lameass excuses had anything to do with the state of their business?   "uhuh, maybe, it's just me."   Ya think?   Do you think that folks who come in here for lunch have time for this foolishness?  Get your act together -- and quickly.  Then I do what I haven't done in ages -- I left.  I asked him what I owed him for the bad arnold palmer (he correctly answers that it's on the house)  and I stood up and left.  Couldn't believe it.  They have bloody no business, and they think this bozo is helping them keep customers. Open letter to Adam Carmer -- Hotel School Professor and (allegedly) Restaurateur:Dear Mr. Carmer, BBQ margaritas aren't enough to sustain or build a restaurant -- let alone a good or truly satisfied restaurant clientele.  Good food, genuine service, great values are.  Your Maryland Parkway operation is a joke.  Please, if you want your substantial investment in this location (which is much appreciated, by the way)  to matter, tap into your healthy employee base (I'm sure you have a few employees who would be interested in picking up some add'l shifts), and bring some experienced talent over.  Better yet -- you don't need a hostess/manager/multiple servers when you have (ahem) NO BUSINESS.   Get those girls on the floor -- teach them about the food and make them earn their money.  Simply reprinting menu placemats does not build business -- oh, yeah, you might have the girls read the menus too...understanding your food and the things that matter to you.  I've found, as I've meandered through the food business, that typically it's helpful, and your customers appreciate it when staff can answer questions, instead of staring at you like you've asked them to create world peace on a plate.   Oh and in case you thought I was pussyfooting around the issue, I won't -- fire the spiky haired kid -- seriously.  Foodservice is not his calling.  I'm sure something is -- but do him, you (and your guests) a favor and please, please cut the chord so that no one has to put up with his lame excuses, and worse than that his mind bending business-ending behavior ever again.   And you might drop me a note when he's gone -- maybe then I'll return.  Yep, that bad.One more thing, your cook at the Flamingo location cooks circles around -- your crew at Maryland Parkway.   Oh, and from what I've seen, he can run the whole damn place singlehandedly -- and is happy and proud to do so.  His food is worth returning for -- as is his attitude.  Send him over to fix Maryland Parkway, or it's truly doomed.  Better yet,  get yourself in there to run things.  Throw the rest of them out, and show us what it is that you know.  Introduce yourself to your guests -- hell there are only about 2 of them, so it shouldn't tax you too much.  Maybe then you'll begin to rebuild your business the old fashioned way, one happy customer at a time.

Review Text :
The lychee gelato was dilizioso! I let each scoop melt on my tongue so I could enjoy every ounce of it. 1 scoop for $5.50 better be worth it!Nicole loved the iced mocha drink so much that she shelled out $7.50 for it. On two occasions. They must have shipped that coffee in directly from Italy.It's Vegas. INDULGE!We arrived in Vegas and were ready to shop, but we needed a little sustenance first.  We were looking at the Venetian/Palazzo map when an employee asked if we needed help.  We told her we were looking for something quick to eat and she directed us to Espressamente.There was a good selection of food to choose from....crêpes, sandwiches, wraps, desserts and gelato.  I ended up getting the Italian club wrap( http://static1.px.yelp.com/bphoto/rmfDHoAyYCOlM0ELJmur_g/l ) and a bottle of water.  The wrap was pretty big and very filling.  No desserts for any of us.  We had dinner a few hours later, so we didn't want to overdo it.  The gelato seemed to be a hit, though.  My lunch came out to $12.92.  Not too bad considering it was Vegas.  It was definitely a good spot for a quick snack.  Next time I'll try the coffee and gelato.This review is based on their gelato which was only A-OK.So I was craving dessert like crazy in Vegas and especially something cold and creamy with it being triple digit weather there at the time. I initially wanted to check out Serendipity 3 and their frozen hot chocolate after I had been reminded of it by my friend Sally. But that never happened as Camellia C. said she preferred to go to New York for the original Serendipity.Anyway, walking around the Palazzo to kill time after a big brunch at Bouchon had me fiending for gelato to cool down.  At Espressamente Illy, two scoops of gelato will cost you around $7 and with that you'd think you'd get some pretty good gelato. It wasn't the bad but it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. Maybe it was because the Spumoni scoop was mixing with the Mango scoop to create an not so flavorful mixture of tastes. I still cleaned those bad boys out as the scoops are definitely on the small side. Which totally sucks when you just overloaded on the Rio Carnival Buffet's gelato bar the previous night. I wasn't going to leave Vegas without checking out at least one dessert place but I ultimately left unfulfilled and will have to come back to scour out different places for gelato/ice cream next time.

Met several old colleagues here for lunch today.  It was the first time I've been to this location, so I was kind of excited to give it a try.  The location is conveniently located off the 215 & Flamingo Rd.....so it was easy access for me and them.The traditional Lindo's Chips & Salsa is served here, complimentary.  It has the same fresh, awesome taste as the other locations.  Good start.After browsing the menu for a little while, I settled on the Lunch Special #3 "Tres".....Beef Chimichanga.  I was going to order a Dos XX or a Pacifico, but since my friends were on lunch from work, I didn't want to throw it in their face that I can drink at lunch and they can't....so I abstained and had an Iced Tea.The food came out pretty fast.  The Chimichanga comes with Rice, Beans, and Sour Cream & Guacamole on the side.  It was cooked just right.....the fried Tortilla was crispy, flaky, and not greasy.  The Beef was shredded and full of flavor.  I like to get their signature Salsa and pour it on top of the Chimichanga....because the Salsa packs a lot of heat and has that Smoky Chipotle flavor to it.  I mixed the Beans & Rice together and devoured the plate.The service was excellent and everyone had a good time.  We spent an hour after lunch talking and catching up on stuff.....even though we settled our bill, the server ensured our glasses were full and that everyone was ok.  It's the signature service I've come to know and love about Lindo and his restaurants....glad to see it was the same here.Will I return?  Of course!I've been here on a few occasions. The interior of the restaurant is really dim, especially in the day time. You might need the light from your cell phone to light up the menu if you don't happen to have bat vision. Service is great. The moment we walked in the door, the hostess greeted us warmly and seated us at a table of our choosing. A moment later we were seated our waiter and busboy both came by to take our drink order and bring us chips, respectively. Our drinks never went empty and our server was always ready to fulfill all our requests. It's definitely not my favorite Mexican food in town, the spice level is definitely toned down and I wish the flavors were just a little more dynamic. I have ordered quite a few things off the menu and have never really been blown away flavor wise, but it's definitely solid. On this occasion, I ordered a shredded chicken burrito, which was huge for the price. It definitely needed more flavor, but it was still a pretty good meal. I'd be back, if I'm in the area again... I'll just make sure to ask for extra chile or spicier salsa on the side.Nothing special.  Refried bean dip is bland, chips needed salt. The oysters are good! Carne asada was tender but lacked seasoning.  Customer service was good. Would I come  back? ... nope.

We came here again the other night for dinner. I have always enjoyed my meals at this place. Again ,I was not disappointed.My girlfriend got wine and I an Ice Tea, they kept it filled the entire time. I really like their Tea,what ever brand it is ,I would like to buy. It is never too bitter or sweet.We both got the chicken and ribs. The ribs are so tender they just fall off the bone. I am not joking about that. They are really good as well. You notice when you are outside as you are walking up the smell is marvelous! Yes, I said it Marvelous!Everything in here is always good. We even got some food to go so we could have it the next day.Nice staff and good food, sounds good to me and we will be back many times in the near future.Lots of parking in the lot.We came here on a Saturday Night. They were very busy! they even had a waiting list.But, when we walked in we were lucky enough to be seated right away. No other party of 2 were on that waiting list, so that is why.Service here is spectacular!  Food was great! We got the shrimp cargot as an appetizer.  was very good, but the very best part of the meal.??? The Ribs. As always they were amazing. They fell right off the bone, they were tender and delicious!Great service, great food, and lots of parking. You cannot ask for much more than that.

I found myself singing the tune of "That don't impress me much" in my mind during my food session.I tried the lasagna pizza at their suggestion as this was my first time and they had quite a few ready made pizzas available by the slice.The toppings were great, the concept of lasagna style topped pizza is a great concept!However where they fail miserably is the crust. The pizza crust is thin, limp, flavorless and soggy which does not support the toppings. I don't want anything that is limp in my mouth, especially when it comes to pizza! The crust was just bad, bad and more bad. No happy ending here :(Hit it and quit it, I am done!Really great pizza, and excellent service. Some of the best pizza in vegas!!!!! They have pizza by the slice,  tons of choices.  Pasta, chicken. Wings and sandwiches.  Really a great place.they close at 9 would  be nice if they were open longer... delicious ...

Review Text :
Really don't get the hype around this place. I'd been once before in the early evening on a weeknight about a year ago and enjoyed it, but my more recent experience there on a Friday night was horrible. I'm a native Montrealer who now lives in NYC and came here with a friend from New York -- we both enjoy the cocktail bars in New York (Raine's Law Room, Little Branch, Weather Up...are some of my favorites) and I thought this would be a good place to go and try to impress people with what Montreal has to offer.There was so much wrong with the place this time that I don't even know where to start but I guess I have to somewhere.For a supposed "cocktail" bar, the drink list and quality is severely lacking. You need to offer something more interesting than a mojito or apple martini if you want to distinguish yourself from any crappy lounge/club on St Laurent. Moreover, the drinks should actually be good: Ours were way too sweet and unbalanced.(I also thought it was hilarious they couldn't make a Pimm's Cup because they were out of Pimm's! How does a bar run out of the base for one of the few drinks it offers??? That's like KFC running out of chicken.)Next, it was way too crowded. That wouldn't be terrible but this place is aiming for a certain sophistication (which it laughably misses). Instead of letting every single person outside into the bar, I'd rather just be made to wait outside for a bit until it clears out inside. It wasn't enjoyable having people pressed up against my back or waiting 20 minutes to make/get a drink order because the staff were overwhelmed.The crowd is amazingly douchey in a Jersey Shore way. Tanktops, basketball shorts, Wu-Tang t-shirts -- name the douchey clothing item and some guy there was wearing it. Absolutely classless, really. A little door policy would go a long way (shit like that doesn't fly in NYC), but clearly Baldwin Barmacie doesn't care.Music was deafeningly loud and a bad blend of generic house and techno. Again, is this a club or a cocktail bar? I'm sorry, but hipster staff in Coke-bottle glasses and long spoons in drinks does not a cocktail bar make.Finally, it's not even nice in here. Sure, from afar it seems cool. But look closer (or better yet, just sit down). The tables are dinky and tiny, the chairs are dirty and the long bench against the wall is covered in some sort of cheap rubber-pleather.Going back to the beginning, the main problem is that the drinks suck. They're not at all interesting, they use cheap liquor (plastic handles...also, soda guns on the non-alcoholic side, instead of real stuff), are weak and they don't taste good. The bad crowd, bad music, and bad service don't help, either... but ultimately, the drinks just suck.Really wondering if I went to the same bar as everyone who gave this place 4 and 5 stars or if they just have no frame of reference. Barmacie Baldwin should either stop halfassing the cocktail bar thing, or give up and become just another bar in Montreal with crappy overpriced drinks (let me get one thing clear -- I'm perfectly happy spending 17 bucks on a good drink but the ones here aren't worth even 12) and greased-up shaved-head dudes in beaters.

Review Text :
The Cafe at Harrah's really shouldn't be as busy as it is.  Located next to Ming's Table, the long line is easily misleading.The 24 hour cafe serves up your standard fare.  They have a special breakfast menu from 6 am to 11 am, and then an all day menu.  Posters advertising their lunch specials for $7.77 are what brought us in yesterday morning.  (And I'm sure it brought many others in, as well.)  When we finally got seated, the breakfast menu was brought out and we asked about their lunch specials.  There were only three options to choose from and they looked far from special.  (I wish the waiter had offered the all day menu to peruse as well.)  There was a steak special that started at 2 pm, and our waiter was quick to tell us he didn't recommend it.  (We appreciated his honesty at least!)I ended up with the Corned Beef Hash breakfast ($10.99).  It comes with two eggs your way, hash browns, and choice of toast, bagel, or English muffin.  Yes, the corned beef hash was salty and basic.  I was a bit disappointed.My aunt ordered the Bone-In Ham and Eggs Breakfast ($14.99) and it was a hearty chunk of ham.  She had leftovers.My other aunt  ordered the Lox and Bagel ($10.99) and it was accompanied by an herb spread, capers, a hard-boiled egg, red onions, and tomato slices.  The breakfasts took a little while to arrive, which was surprising when our neighbors got their food way before we did.  Our water glasses were rarely refilled, we actually helped ourselves to their makeshift water/OJ station right next to our table. We didn't appreciate the extra $1.99 charge for salsa that appeared on our bill.  (Uh, don't they usually tell you when things cost extra?)Overall, it's expensive and not worth the price.  My mistake was not planning a breakfast/brunch place ahead of time because we would have paid more for better food and better experience.  With this price, you might as well go to the lunch or breakfast buffets instead!$5.99 Steak and Eggs Special. Daily midnight to 6am.Small portion. Nasty tough steak. Liquid eggs.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/G9OOkWH5rLHN3DKNPMv1lg?select=3Vvmnss0ZjMdoeiPnXH_3Q)The server was horrible. Party of 9, he refused to take our orders on paper. Instead he made us raise our hands. First with the steaks: "Who wants medium?" "Who wants medium-rare?"  Then with the eggs: "Who wants what?" It was even more frustrating since he couldn't remember our orders and had to ask again.Don't ever come here for the Steak and Eggs Special. (Read my previous review)My brother-in-law and I dropped in here between microbrew stops on our little tour of Vegas microbrews.  As best as I can recall it was around 11:30 at night and we realized that besides a light meal we split earlier in the evening we hadn't had dinner.  After leaving Sin City Brewing and walking around debating where to go next hunger crept up on us.When this happened we were in front of Harrah's.  So we walked in and ambled our way around to the Cafe at Harrah's.  The prices were reasonable and the food was reasonably mediocre.  We each had a 1/2 sandwich and bowl of soup.Our service was bizarre.  We were sitting caddy corner and the waiter first approached from behind both of us, silently appearing like Dracula from out of nowhere.  The rest of the meal he would only arrive in this manner.  When he left the check I put it out on the table where he would have to come to the front of the table to reach it.  After he had walked by several times without picking it up I suggested that maybe he would only get it if it were on the corner between us and he could grab it  from behind.  I moved it there and within a moment he slipped up from behind and nabbed it.  By this time we were referring to him as our backdoor friend.

Alright look, I'm a california girl.  I don't know much about authentic BBQ really... but I do know what tastes good.IDK what it is about the beans here, but they are like crack.  I would come here and just eat the beans.  Wholly mother of god they are good.I had a pulled pork sandwich that was good.  It lacked spice but I fixed that right up with their habanero bbq sauce.  That sauce was so damn good I just wanted to put the bottle in my purse.  Then I realized I couldn't take it on the plane... so I held back.We had six people (well, 5 and a bebe), and the bill was only $80.  Not bad.  Service was awesome.  Just don't serve me that sweet tea when I order tea, OK?!  If I don't use words like, "y'all" when I order, then understand that we west coasters don't get down with that sugar water.  Blehhhhhhchh.When I put a little of the habanero sauce in my beans it's like, OMG, this might just be the best thing eva. EVAHHHHHHHH

If I could give this place negative stars I would. I have never been so humiliated in my whole life. I was there on a sunday evening for my 21st birthday and they denied my I.D. even though I had my social security card, my bank card my school I.D. and my medical card. I was made to stand up in the middle of the restaurant, take off my shoes, sign my signature twice, call my friends phone to show my name and still denied service. At this point I was in tears as my two friends asked if we needed to pay for the fries we did not even touch and the manager said NO.  As we left to go to Dave and Busters next door the manager from Cadillac Ranch had called there and said we "refused" to pay and we were not let into any of the surrounding restaurants. Keep in mind this was my 21st birthday.  I will make sure that NO ONE I KNOW will EVER go to Cadillac Ranch.I went there this last Monday for happy hour and dinner:  Most of my experience was positive....until the end. We did have a few small service issues, most of which are typical of a fairly new staff in training.  However, we did have a big problem regarding our bill at the end.During our meal on 8/31/2009 (dinner time), the manager came by and asked how everything was going, we let him know that it was great but to please send by our waitress as we hadn't seen her in awhile. When we received our bill, we were pleasantly surprised to see a few items comped to a 0 dollar charge.  I grabbed my card and gave it to the waitress to pay the tab of approximately $14.50. I was quite surprised when she returned the card and receipt (which had now been charged to my card) for more than $36.00 without even mentioning it to us.  She had also removed the original receipt and put a new one for the correct amount.I asked to see the manager, who came buy to discuss this with us.  Here is a quick breakdown of the conversation:Question from manager: Did we eat the items?Answer from me: Of course we did...the issue wasn't that we were paying for them, it is that your staff substituted the receipt for a different one, charged us more than double what I authorized, and didn't notify us.  How can you do this without at least letting us know that you changed the amount?Answer from manager: Well I am hearing a different story from her...she indicates that she told you.  Plus we have already given you a good break on the prices of your drinks.Response from me: First off,  don't take it from me....ask the 3 other people at the table.   Secondly, it was happy hour...these were your advertised prices.  How is it that you gave me a "break" on your prices?Response from the manager: Look, what is it that you want from me?  You ate the food, it was a computer mistake....can I have your business card?Response from me: My business card, what does my job have to do with this?Answer from manager:  It looks like you just left from working in a restaurant by the way you are dressed?  At this point...I signed the receipt and left.  Zero tip of course (sorry to be an jerk...but I was not happy.)To be honest, I don't remember ever being more frustrated with someone before.  I really wasn't expecting a free ride or meal, but an apology and explanation of HOW you can replace the original receipt with a new one for more than twice the original amount and charge it would have sufficed.So, I wrote a review on this place a while back about how this place was unfriendly to tattooed people and wouldn't even let me get close to the front door and was pleased to see that I got a little apology from the owner. But when I read the actual comment she left, it was this "Thank you for taking the time to write this review. I apologize your level of service expectations were not met. It's our mission to please every customer with wonderful food, outstanding service, awesome entertainment and speedy service.Sincerely,Jessica (Marketing/ Event Coordinator) Cadillac Ranch Tempe"First of all Jessica, I didn't actually experience any service at your establishment, or even had a chance to have my expectations met or not. My experience wasn't the kind that you can go, "Sorry for the service"  And Thank you so much for cutting and pasting this generic apology on every bad review Cadillac ranch gets. (Didn't think we would notice that?) By you doing that, It honestly just showed me that you truly didn't care about making it right at all by actually reading what happened in my experience there and apologizing for it. Instead you picked all the reviews with one star and stuck the same apology over and over hoping that would be enough to appease the public. I would say I have never been so insulted in my life but if you actually take the two minutes out of your busy day to actually read my review this time. you will obviously see otherwise. Thank you "Jessica" and Cadillac ranch staff for once again showing your true colors when it comes to customer service by doing the bare minimum. Next time actually read the review.   -Thank you-Don't be fooled by happy hour prices. I went yesterday and the waitress talked about 1/2 price appetizers, drinks, well drinks, etc. That price is only good at the bar. If you are at a table you will not get it. I went with some friends and we ordered drinks and appetizers. An order of chicken wings, an order of pretzels, 2 double vodka & 7ups, a single vodka & 7up and 4 coke & crowns. All ordered before 7pm when happy hour is over. Total price $ 71. Someone in management must have ridden that bull and hit their head - and the waitresses false advertise until the bill comes. If you are out for a happy hour in Tempe drive on past this place.First of all, I'm out to have a good time on my birthday. The id checker told me that my birthday was yesterday even though it was 11 pm on my actual birthday. Then we get in and the bartender (male) looks over at the female bartender and goes, "are you going to get them?" to which she rudely replies, "no you get them". Everyone was rude from the get go. We just went to check them out. I give good reviews where ever I go. But I felt bombarded with rudeness and hated it. We walked out in less than 5 minutes. Don't do it!

Molly had a stand at the Westgate farmers' market, and I tried one of her (full-size!) samples of red pork. It was very tasty and moist, if not as spicy as I would like. She did say that you can request that your dozen be made spicier. It was also really full of meat. She also said that she only uses really good cuts of meat, and no lard.However, I passed on buying a dozen, as I thought $26 was a little high, and I wanted to try some more elsewhere.

OK. So I've only had a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese. I'm not a New Yorker. I'm not a bagel expert. I know the yelp debate on this culinary disc can get more heated than a black leather seat in Phoenix in July. But each time, it's perfect. Cream cheese is spread evenly on the bagel. Bagel is cut in half and wrapped in white paper. I hate the places that serve you cream cheese in a little squeeze packet. UGH! I never get all the cream cheese out and end up cutting it open and licking it out. Like the lady in the commercial squeezing ketchup packets at home into her ketchup bottle to save money.The gentleman behind the counter is friendly and remembers my name even when I don't. The menu has pastries, hot breakfast and hot lunches. You can also grab fruit, yogurt and Snapple. There's plenty of reading material and the decor is simple yet comfortable. It's tucked away at City Square Plaza (gee, thus the name)...next to the Light (De)Railed Cafe. Yep. It's 86'd. Thanks City Square Cafe...for allowing me to make a pit stop on my way to work. Those three blocks can be grueling in the summer and it's refreshing to cool down a bit before walking 200 yards to my job.

Tried to be healthy and get a bite to eat here instead of the junk food restaurants at the airport.  Only one person in line ahead of me, 4 employees doing nothing, I waited 5 minutes, got frustrated, and left.  Why 4 employees would waste people's time like that is beyond me.Instead I went to a Burrito place and overpaid for a boatload of calories I didn't need.Will I return?  I might have caught them on an off day, so I will try to come here again next time.  For now, 2 Stars.

We avoided this place, for the first few months after it opened, just because it is hard to make a left out of the plaza that it sits in. Mistake! I really like the NY style pizza (by NY style, I mean crust is neither really thin nor really thick, really tasty sauce use sparingly, and lots of cheese), and just love their wings - nice and vinegary, with as much heat as I want or don't want. The service is always pretty fast, the restaurant is spanking clean, and there are big, flat panels hung around the place... and there's always a game on. They were running good pitcher specials, whenever the Suns played. I've not had their Sicilian style, sandwiches or pasta dishes, but from watching other patrons enjoy them, they must be good! The most expensive item is NY style steak pizza or a specialty Sicilian, around $18, and a pitcher of beer is about $7-8. Wings run about $6 (10 piece) to $15 (30), and they do have an everyday special - the usual large pizza and 20 wings for under $20. I recommend this place, for the locals. Time to dump Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's... this is a local business that is worth supporting!

Poutine: thick and rich peppery gravy , crisp french fries and appropriate cheese. The poutine vegetarienne is excellent also, but the traditional poutine will do just fine. This is the best poutine in Montreal, right ahead of Poutine Lafleur in Verdun. Born and raised in Quebec, whenever I visit this is the ONE poutine that I want to go to again. And always do. Darn it, now I want one and I'm 600 miles away. Please christmas break, come faster.

I love going here for lunch!  I have been there several times because it is close to work and I have to get out of the office!  I love the soups here. Just had the vegetable and the ingredients were so fresh.  The salads are also very good.  I have tried the blueberry wrap and that is one of my favorites.  I have heard from the owner that she will even be delivering to office buildings in the area.  This is the best place to go if you like everything fresh.  Perfect vegetarian spot!The food? Absolutely amazing.And that's where it ends.As a vegetarian, I am always looking for new places to eat. I work near Chakra and a co-worker and I decided to head over there on our (hour) lunch break. We walked in and saw a sign that said "please wait to be greeted!" so... we did. For almost ten minutes. A few employees glanced at us and didn't say anything. Finally, an employee told us we could "sit anywhere we wanted" - why did we need to wait to be greeted, then? Oh well. The food isn't cheap. A tea and the Nutty Raw-vacado ran me nearly 20 bucks with tip. Our server was all right, but it took ten minutes just to get her over to get our drink orders. Another 25-30 minutes passed (we were looking at around 1:45 and we had to be back to work by 2PM) and our food was finally out.And it was REALLY good. The plate was overflowing with greens and my sandwich was delicious. We stuffed our faces pretty quickly - I didn't get to enjoy my food half as much as I would've liked! My co-worker mentioned that last time he had eaten at Chakra, he had ended up having a nearly 2-hour lunch because of the slow service. I hate to say it, but, for almost all raw food, what the heck is taking so long in the kitchen?As delicious as the food was, I have to say - I probably won't be back to Chakra.Chakra easily gets 4 starts in my book because if I try to access the website at work it is blocked - "The Websense category "Supplements and Unregulated Compounds" is filtered." You know it's got to be good stuff if it's filtered at work, all the best stuff is filtered at work.Onto the cafe...I should really visit Chakra more often. It's actually healthy Vegan food, usually when I head out we are going for more of the junk Vegan food variety but for 2011 maybe I will make some changes.....maybe not. The food is great, I had soup and the their version of a quesadilla. Everything had great flavor and wasn't heavy on anything besides the good healthy stuff. Place is very chill and waitstaff was great.My only complaint being that when I entered I was not sure if I was supposed to seat myself or wait to be seated. I stood there for a few minutes like some protein deficient vegan moron and subsequently got ignored a few times till I finally just asked and was seated. Also, everything appears to be healthy here and they make it a point to tell you on the menu, yet they also make it a point to exclude ALL soy products but they have dairy products??! What?! Ok, not all soy products are created equal and there isn't much concrete evidence surrounding this great soy debate anyway. You won't lose me as a customer but I wouldn't mind if there was some organic tofu or tempeh on the menu either. Just know I am laughing inside that you are including dairy products but excluding soy and I will drop it. In total I guess that is two complaints.Don't let my minor annoyances discourage you (most of my annoyances are relateable by .5% of the population), this place is solid with solid healthy food. I would not give it 4 stars if it wasn't. Go eat and enjoy.I recently read somewhere that Red Raspberry leaf tea is beneficial during pregnancy, and that it specifically helps to strengthen the pelvic and uterine muscles so that once labor does start the muscles will be more efficient.  Hmm... considering I'm past my due date, I figured it couldn't hurt to get some of this stuff!I'd dined at Chakra 4 Vegetarian Restaurant once before and had a lovely experience... it's not my typical meal as everything there is vegetarian or vegan, but it's healthy and almost like a unique escape from my usual rotation of restaurants.  So, when I decided to search for Red Raspberry leaf tea, this place came to mind, and they delivered!Jared joined me for lunch here, and I was pleasantly surprised that he really liked it... Maggie was our server and couldn't have been sweeter.  Jared started with an iced chai tea and ordered a wrap / soup combo for his meal.  I went with the Red Raspberry leaf tea and had "Chef Justin's Special Raw Living Raw Living Garden Burger" for my meal.  (See pic of menu description).  The food here is pricey but I guarantee you will feel super healthy no matter what you order!  We opted out of dessert both visits, but there were plenty of delicious looking options to choose from, so save room if you'd like to end your meal with something sweet.I took some of the Red Raspberry leaf tea home with me and have been drinking a ton of it in hopes that I will have an easy labor/delivery real soon.  The tea was very moderately priced when taken to-go by the way, which was a pleasant surprise.  Regardless of what happens in the next few days, I do recommend Chakra 4 Vegetarian Restaurant and their tea room, and I will be back!

I love, love, love this place!  I randomly found this bakery online while searching for a bakery to make gluten free wedding cakes in Arizona.  I called them up and they were the most accommodating and helpful people ever.  They took on the challenge of making my gf wedding cake even though they had never attempted to make a wedding cake before and they made the best gf cake I've had.  The guests at my wedding were clamoring for my cake even though we had a regular one for everyone else!  When my husband and I visited GF Creations they had a tiny 3 table bistro just off to the side of the bakery.  I'm not sure if they still have it, but it was cute and we were able to sit down and eat.  I had a burger on a gf hamburger bun and my husband had a gf reuben.  Very tasty.  I would also highly recommend picking up a pie if they happen to have any when you visit.  I tried their cherry pie and it was awesome.  Overall I think this place is a dream come true for any gluten free person out there (they also cater to other allergies as well).  If you ever find yourself in Phoenix you must check it out.  You will not be disappointed.Gluten Free Creations is amazing. It's a bakery that makes an enormous amount of gluten free pastries, breads, doughs, buns, etc. If you are allergic or intolerant to gluten, do yourself the favor and check them out. The gluten free bread at Sprouts supermarkets in AZ is supplied by Gluten Free Creations, which is very good. Also, the gluten free pizza dough for Picazzo's restaurants comes from this bakery. Most importantly, GF Creations sells gluten free breadcrumbs for turkey stuffing!!!!!! Make sure to get your order in early as I'm sure they're super busy around Thanksgiving and Christmas. Two years ago was my fiance's first Thanksgiving being gluten free and we figured he'd be royally screwed in the stuffing department. Lo and behold, Gluten Free Creations came to the rescue! They sell breadcrumbs just for the occasion! The stuffing came out so good that no one eating it (including wheat eaters) could tell it was gluten free! It's tucked away and can be hard to find. The front makes it look like a small operation but it's anything but tiny. Unfortunately most of the pastries have eggs or dairy in them so if you have multiple allergies, make sure you look at all the ingredients. Their hamburger buns aren't all that great, kind of like 2 lb. hockey pucks if ya know what I mean but I wouldn't hold that against them. Everything else has been amazing. The staff is very helpful and you just can't go wrong if you have a gluten allergy or intolerance.Wow... just wow.  This place is heaven for non-gluten eaters.  Up until about 30mins ago I was getting a little depressed over this whole cupcake craze.  Not anymore, I just ate one of the best cupcakes I have ever had and it was gluten-free and dairy-free!They have everything here:  cupcakes, cookies, pizza dough (they supply the gf dough to all the pizza joints in town that do gf pizza), pasta, hamburger buns, rolls, twinkies, cakes, pies, thanksgiving stuffing, bread crumbs to make your own stuffing, bagels, white bread, baguettes, I mean everything!  Oh, and it all tastes amazing.The location is a little hard to find the first time being behind a barber shop and, like all gluten-free products, is not very cheap, but if you avoid gluten and dairy, this place is a god send.  They are very knowledgeable about their products, make everything in house, and have their products listed by allergen.... so if you don't eat dairy, eggs, or nuts, or any combination, they have it all under an easy list.  They can also special make anything for you... birthday cakes, whatever.i have two words for you: herb baguette. I'm not a bread lover but this baguette doesn't need anything to taste good. Forget butter and don't bother dipping in olive oil. How is it possible that bread be so moist, dense, airy and flavorful all at the same time? I have no freakin' idea and that's why I have to buy from Gluten Free Creations, because there's no way I could replicate that. Okay okay I have no qualms with gluten. I don't really care what it is because it doesn't seem to affect me negatively, but why should only the celiac kids get the good stuff? And yes, I have tried to find this place twice before and failed (are gluten eaters stupid-er? possibly) but third times a charm when I stopped in this week. I'll admit it, I was looking for a cupcake. I think we all know about my cupcake addiction. GFC sells cupcakes in a 4-pack, which I can't support because that means I have to eat 4 cupcakes and I'm already killing myself at the gym for my one-at-a-time habit. But seriously, they had gluten free banana cupcakes! I was so sad they didn't have a spare to sell me...so sad I bought the mini herb baguettes and a brownie. The brownie was a two-person affair, a big frozen delight filled with thick chunks of chocolate. I couldn't tell the difference between it and a gluten-full brownie and that made me very happy. I think it may be time to start the "what makes a good brownie" debate; I feel like it will be a volatile one. I like them chewy with chunky bits. But the fluffy ones are nice too.  Truly though, the hero of the day was the herb baguette, which is a little smaller than a 6-inch sub, takes a long time to toast, but is worth the wait. I topped one of mine with farmer's cheese, roasted garlic and roasted red peppers. And I sat at the table crying because I knew each bite I took meant there was one less to take in the future. I love you Gluten Free Creations. I'm feeling smarter already.Recently I gots the allergic to wheats and the soy (teh suck!)Last week was my birthday and Michelle, my wife, bought a cake (and some other nifty creations) from these guys. I have had so many different "attempts" at gluten free stuff over the last couple years and let me tell you, most of it all tastes like CRAP!NOT THESE GUYS!!!I was so relieved biting into my chocolate cake, doughnuts, and bagels. Oh my gosh! It tastes good and pretty darn close to the original. I can't tell you how amazing it has been to have "good" baked goods again. Big props to GFC Bakery. I love you guys and I'll be back OFTEN!GFC is absolutely a heaven sent treat from above!For those of us with gluten intolerance, it is incredibly difficult to find bread, bagels, pizza dough, pastries, etc that do not have the fateful binding agent, but wonderful places like GFC save the day!They are located behind an auto oil changing shop (I think Midas) at 30th street and Thomas. They close at 5pm during the week, but if you call them and let them know you are on the way, they will wait around for you! Nice service!I'm vegan so I am limited with all the items I can try, but I can tell you the vegan gluten free chocolate chip cookies are amazing AND loved by regular eaters. I don't think Brad E could get enough!This time around I also discovered they have veggie burgers in buns! You can throw them in the microwave, but I put mine on the grill twice; both the buns and the patty. DELICIOUS!I love the onion bagels, especially with some vegan cream cheese! I also really enjoy the herb baguettes.Really cool news is that they just purchases Lulu's Cupcakes, so they will be opening in about a week (McDowell and Miller) with a small deli where they make sandwiches and they will have a retail area where you can get products from the bakery!Really really amazing place that I am incredibly thankful for!Oh, and if you live by Luci's (16th St and Bethany) they carry GFC items there too!I have been by this place several times now. Also now that I am far more aware of what I am eating, I pay attention.So today I went in. I found out this place has been here for 10 years.It is a bakery, as well as an Eat in or to go dinner.So much to choose from in here as well.Bread, cookies, bagels,Pizza dough,muffins, etc, etc, etc...I also really like that you can buy your own mixes on everything and make it your self if you so want to do it.Menu for meals is great and when you see all the food places they supply to you will be surprised as well.The even sell all types of cakes. You can order them form the book complete with decorations.It is not all too cheap in here. But, A little extra effort is worth the extra price ,I think.When we are all swelling up like Balloons changing your diet can do wonders.I will be happy to come back here. Yeah, for a great find!

Two facts:Culvers trumps In N Out.Whoever compared Culvers to Dairy Queen is bonkers. they don't even compareI have been hearing this dumb commercial about 'being culverized' on KTAR and all I could think was how dumb it was that we were getting commercials for places we don't even have.ha, i was dumb. we do have a culvers!!! and i am now in love.reasons why it's better than In N Out:-while I love In N Outs meat patties, their cheese selection sucks. at culvers you pick your cheese- american, cheddar or swiss (i hate american cheese which is the only cheese offered at In N Out)- They have red onion, i love both onions but red is way better-I like their hamburger patties just a bit more than In N Outs(both are good)- Culvers shakes and custard are totallllllyyyyyy better than any milkshake In N Out could ever make.- I love all the options of burgers you can get at culvers! including bacon and if you dont want a burger their chicken strips look pretty awesome i am so excited i heard those dumb commercials and looked them up!!!!!!i will say that In N Outs fries are way better than culvers.  but that's it.When I first moved to Phoenix and then to the East Valley I was looking for new and different places to try.  I had never heard of Culver's.  I looked over their website and on one Saturday afternoon my daughter and I took a ride out this way.  We looked over the menu and I had one of their famous Butter Burgers.....Mushroom and Swiss, and my daughter had a grilled cheese.  The kids meals come with a one scoop sundae too, good deal.  Let me say that Butter Burgers are delicious!  I love them.  Their fries are good too but then I found cheese curds......OMG!  I am from California so I had never had these morsals of goodness before.  A Butter Burger, cheese curds and a root beer and I'm good.  But then the frozen custard.......YUM!!!  And a Concrete Mixer....wow!  And they run a special on pints to take home.  You can get 4 pints of custard for $8 and change!  Good deal!  They have a different flavor everyday.  Recently I had Pumpkin Pecan and it was delicious! The service is always fast and friendly.  I have never experienced anything but a smile here.  This location is about 10 miles from me and not far in the grand scheme of things.  I recently found out that they opened a new location closer to me!!  YAY!!  Forget those other fast food joints.  McDonald's pales in comparison.  Butter Burgers are fresh and soooo good.  And they have a variety of other choices.  They also offer fried chicken, fish and salads.  But note....this is NOT for someone on a diet.  This is where you splurge!  I love Culvers!!  Now if In and Out had frozen custard too I would be torn.

Restaurant name  Raising Cane's

Review Text :
For those that read my last review on Rio buffet knows that I was in Vegas last week.  So while driving around town in Vegas I've passed by and noticed a huge "Cane's" sign.  Not sure what that was so the moment I got back to the room, I've decided to look them up.  There I realized that it's not "Cane's", but Raising Cane's Chicken Finger Restaurant.  So being a curious foodie that I am... I had to make a point to check them out before I'm heading back to good ol LA.My initial reaction... chicken finger restaurant?  What the?  I really got to go see it.  Upon my arrival (10:50am), There were like 3 people getting some food in front of me.  The location is right on Flamingo and near Maryland Pkwy which you can't miss, and it's super clean!  (Sorry for the sidetrack but I'll focus now!)So the interior was squeaky clean to me!  Perhaps it was early in the day but it definitely smelled really good, super clean, very pleasant.  So now I'm approaching the counter.The clerk was extremely courteous!  Very nice touch because I'm a sucker for service!  I told her that this is my first time here and that I'm from LA, and she gave me a good quick run down on the business history and what they offer...  I'm sure they were part of the procedure but nevertheless it's interesting to hear.Very simply menu... it's pretty much 3 pcs of chicken with toast, fries, cole slaw and sauce, the 4 pcs version, or the Caniac (6 pcs version which was their large combo)  Having people in my party I had to get the 6 pcs with 2 sauces...Here's how the food tasted...  Chicken finger was great!  Solid chicken pieces, freshly prepared, but to me it was slightly small that I would have liked for the price (which I'll get to in a minute).  Crinkle fries were pretty good... (I don't complain much about fries as they are my favorite, but I don't like steak fries too much because it's like eating an entire potato)  Cane sauce was decent, it was pretty much a hybrid of mayo based sauce mixed in with chili of some sort.. not too salty which is great with a little kick to it.  Texas toast was a thick piece of loaf with very little garlic butter on it, and the cole slaw was a cole slaw... nothing out of the ordinary and mediocre at it's best.  It also came with a drink though... (They got southern sweet tea which was pretty sweet!  LOL!) The total of my meal came out be just under $9... it's little steep for me but the experience was very positive.  Again the chicken tender pieces could of been either bigger, or they could have substituted for more pieces considering that we are paying $9 bucks, but I have to say the quality of the chicken was very good and will definitely visit them again in the near future when I go back to Vegas.So the history was about a guy writing a business plan on opening a chicken finger only restaurant, but was shot down by his professors, countless bankers, and eventually, worked hard a a day job and saved enough money so he can make his dream come true... Very inspiring if you ask me!  So maybe this review may not be as funny as others, but do remember that as long as you put your heart in doing what you love to do, work hard and not give up, you will eventually be rewarded!WHERE: Flamingo & Maryland Parkway (right by UNLV)WHY: I have a strong gut feeling that this may be the best Cane's location out of the Las Vegas chain! Haha.WHAT:  I have previously written a review about one of the other Cane's locations, but this is my absolute favorite location! The reasons behind my judgement is that the customer service is the best, the food is the best, and it stays 100 percent consistent!The handful of times I have come here, I have never been let down.  There are times when the fries are either too salty, too soggy, or too crispy. Or times when the chicken fingers just don't taste how they should be tasting. But! Never has any of these incidents happened to me here!! I just may be their number one fan and proud!The manager was an absolute sweetheart! I had forgotten my Caniac Club card, and he made it easy to accommodate me! There was one time I had forgotten my card at one of the other locations, and I couldn't redeem my box combo there! They had told me to email and or contact Cane's Corporate!! & sure did!In summation, before I go off rambling about how much I love this location, STOP BY, ORDER SOME TOAST & SWEET TEA, AND HAVE A MARRY DAY! =DA couple of friends who were celebrating their birthdays in Vegas over the weekend wanted to try Raising Cane's for lunch. There are multiple locations around Vegas, but this one was the closest to us and off-strip.I had no idea Raising Cane's was fast food and didn't know what to expect. The place was packed around 1:30 pm and we got into line, which moved quickly. They specialize in chicken fingers, so there aren't many options. I decided on The Box Combo, which included four chicken fingers, Texas toast, coleslaw, crinkle-cut fries their famous Cane's sauce, and a regular drink for $7. It was more than enough food for me and I couldn't finish the fries or slaw. The chicken tenders came in huge pieces and were super filling, although a bit dry on the inside but the yummy Cane's sauce helped with that.Service was awful. The cashier who rang me up was clueless, distracted, and rude. I asked her what was in the coleslaw and she straight up giggled and said, "I don't know." I just looked at her, thinking she'd ask a manager or provide some other response, but nope; all I got back was a blank stare. Okay... After that lovely exchange, she seemed completely disinterested in me and kept making googly eyes at this guy behind me, who I assume she personally knew, and basically had a side conversation with him while I was trying to order.Overall, Raising Cane's reminds me of another chain, Chicken Now, as they're pretty much on the same playing field. To be honest, I'd rather go to McDonald's (guilty pleasure) than come here again, but I wouldn't be opposed if friends wanted to come back. But before then, I'd like to try Strip 'N Dip Chicken Strips next time since I've had that bookmarked for awhile.

This place is so much fun and laid-back, I absolutely adore it. You feel like you're actually in another country for awhile. The decor totally sets the mood with the wooden benches and tables that have writing all over them. Very fun. But the food at a practical steal is why I always keep coming back here. During happy hour for UNLV/CSN students from 5-7 PM and 10-11 PM, you can get 4 classic tacos, 2 sides, and a can of soda for $5. Otherwise, this combo is $7.25 which is still a great deal because by the end of your meal they should guarantee that your button will pop off your pants or you get it free. I didn't even finish one of my tacos and I still felt like I wanted to die, but in a good way. I am getting full just thinking about it.I went with my boyfriend who also got the combo, his with meat and I went veg of course. I got three veggie tacos off of the classic menu, and then paid 50 cents extra for my last taco to be a Tofu Adobo taco. Unfortunately I can't tell you what was in the latter taco because I devoured it so damn fast. But the other veggie tacos are always made fresh and to perfection. Onion, peppers, zucchini with some crazy orange sauce that gives it a little kick. SO good. Unfortunately my sweet potato fries were a bit lacking on this visit, but the black beans with onion and garlic are always delicious. As I was perusing the menu with my honey, I noticed that they had something amazing at the bottom: homemade flan. I grew up on my grandfather's flan so I had to have it. Let's just say this wasn't my grandpa's flan. It had seeds on the top, and came with chips. Strange, but it was love at first bite. Order that with a Mexican Coke and you will have sugar rush like no other. You'll also probably want to throw up in the parking lot for the amount of food eaten, but I tell you it will be worth it. This place is very casual, the service is always good, and the food is beyond delicious. Of course sometimes the tacos are hit or miss, so I suggest to get 4 completely different ones with your meal and see which ones you like. But this place gets 5 stars because it's a comfortable experience at a great price, you get a ton of good (veg*n friendly!) food and hell - they recycle! Come in on a night when they have live bands playing and it is a total blast.Like approaching the gorgeous woman across the bar, only to learn she smells like body odor and Doritos.Like buying the vacation package that looked perfect online, just to find your "luxury cruise" is really a mattress on the floor of a fishing barge. Like buying a car off Craigslist, driving it 2 blocks and having all four wheels fall off.Such is Yayo Taco, looking mighty good up front and turning out to be something completely different in the end. Do you know how excited I was to hear they had a slew of vegetarian/vegan tacos? I guess no, you wouldn't know how excited I was so I'll tell you: SUPER FUCKING EXCITED. We went here on purpose a few miles from our hotel just to rock their veggie tacos. Multiple tofu options, from BBQ to veggie and tofu, different sauces... promising stuff. They looked amazing on paper and when they got in front of me on the plate I almost freaked out they looked so good. I was buzzed, 'tis Vegas after all, and when I saw that sexy plate'o'tacos I got ready to regulate. Booze and tacos man, best there is.So I took a bite. And another bite. One more bite just to confirm, and yea, totally boring. Waaaaay boring. Ultra-mega-super-compound-massive boring. Hopefully I made that clear enough, BORING. So I ate all three of my tacos, each one different, each one differently boring. Finding food boring when you're drunk is hard to do which makes me even more sad.Maybe the meat ones are the shit, I dunno, but I can 100% vouch that the vegan options are not. One extra star because the lady working the counter was sweet and also simply for having some vegetarian/vegan items in the first place. They were healthy and had very fresh ingredients, just a damn shame the tacos had no flavor. *sigh*I dig it. Cool little spot..often filled with UNLV students, and musicians of a sort. I stop in now and then for a few tacos and a few great beers.  They have  great beer selection. I'ma fan of the "Innes and Gunn Rum Cask Aged Beer" too sweet for some, great on my pallet with some spicy pastor tacos. I usually sit at the bar when grabbing a quick bite, but on a day off I'll chill at a table, grab a SEVEN and a WEEKLY and just relax for a bit. The owner is super chill, has a great attitude about things and likes what he does. It's super, extra casual as it's very close to UNLV. and it's got a dive feel to it, and that's all part of the charm. I spent a few years slumming around New Orleans and it brings me back to that. On that note, it actually reminds me of some of the more creative en devours I experience when in a town like New Orleans. So chill and go with the flow. With a price tag of about $1.75-$5.00 per person, it's a favorite spot for quick  and delicious grub. They have everything from carnitas style tacos to vegetarian options. YaYo taco doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. It's a taco joint with some flavor. I will go back again and again. Happy Eating!Based completely on the comment from this business to my *honest* review, I won't be coming back. The health department is around for a reason and, if this restaurant rejects their standards as too "institutionalized", I can't imagine wanting to give this place another chance. As I stated, if the violations were silly ones, like not having their letter grade displayed in the exact place specified by the health department, I'd overlook the grade. Unfortunately, this restaurant appears to proudly flout safe food-handling procedures and they're extraordinarily sanctimonious about it. Listen, Yayo Taco, I'm not in cahoots with "the Man". I just don't like food poisoning.

What? They don't have air conditioning in Ireland? Agnes of God! It was hotter than the Blarney Stone on a hot humid June day. Plus we were tucked in away in an alcove, which was probably a cool table, I'm just not into big groups being smashed in a corner. What if I have to get out and pee? What if there's a fire? What if that mean leprachaun from that Jennifer Aniston movie comes in with a machete and starts hacking people? The Good: Server was very friendly and didn't mind being called babe, but don't call her sweetheart. I think gay guys can get a way with this. Hetero men, I'm not so sure. Smithwick on tap! My Irish eyes were smiling! Cute ass plaid skirts worn by cute as hell servers. The Bad: Potato skins....ummm...so basically it's a boiled potato with some weird cheese film wrapped around it, like gauze on a big toe. But it came with sour cream and chives and I could rub that all over my body and be happy.The Ugly. NEVER, did we receive silverware. Service was s l o w! Look we're not in Europe. We are not a leisurely people! Atmosphere was scattered and not really an Irish theme threaded throughout the large space. This one busboy chewing gum like a horse coming off ecstasy. Gross! I hate gum chewers! Especially when they are working. Etc...The Club sandwich was pretty good. Great 9 grain bread and a cranberry mayo but slim on the turkey and it had that weird processed texture and flavor.ABC was there citing the bartender for serving underage drinkers. Poor dude. It was an awkward moment for everyone. So Darcy McGee's I'd be back for a Smithwick. But my Lucky Charms ass will be sure to bring a small fan. And of course. My ID!Cheers!

This place gave me a whole new perspective on molecular gastronomy. I'd had it before, but never executed quite this well. I was a little skeptical of all the great reviews, but this place lived up to its acclaim. This was one of the few Montreal restaurants on Open Table, so reservations were a snap. This is also one of the more elegant restaurants I've dined at in Montreal, so I'd recommend dressing up a bit. We got the 7 course tasting menu, along with the vintage wine pairing (there were two wine pairing options, vintage and regular). Amuse: Tangerine juice, served in a shot glass, topped with fir foam. First course: Scallop served in the shell, with apple foam & cranberry water. Wine pairing: 1998 macon late harvest chardonnaySecond course: Monkfish liver with sake gelée and organic soy sauce. Wine pairing: 1993 soaveThird course: Seared foie gras with chili jelly, groundcherry, daikon, apple water, sugar/salt on flower petal. Wine pairing: 1996 sauternes.Fourth course: Chicken topped with a sheet of homemade pasta with green onion oil. Wine pairing: 1996 Morgon beaujolais.Fifth course: Venison with elderberries, red pepper chips, garlic, root vegetables, brussels sprouts, Wine pairing: 1970 Rioja Faustino (bottled in 1974).Sixth course: Cheese plate with melted local cheese, homemade potato chips, pine nuts, red bell peppers, quince. (Wine pairing: didn't come with the tasting menu but we got a N.V. aged Tokai)Seventh course: Baked cored apple with apple sherbet, coconut/sour cream powder, cranberry reduction. Needless to say, it was a pretty impressive dinner. The colors and presentation of each dish were a work of art to behold, as well as to taste. The service was impeccable throughout the evening; the kind of service where your every need is anticipated. At one point a busser poured tap water into our sparkling water glasses, and even though it wasn't that big a deal our server immediately noticed and whisked those glasses away, bringing out a new bottle of sparkling water. Of all the meals we had on our last trip, this is one of the ones that was the most haunting; days later I'd still be thinking about some aspect of this meal. Montreal has so many excellent restaurants, so this is yet another one that is worth trying at least once.Wow! I called my dish - especially the appetizer, fireworks! It's an explosion of flavor and no two bites taste the same.We were thinking of looking for another place because of prices, but took the bullet and decided to stay... And were so happy we did!The bread was ok, but every other dish after that was a work of art with a beautiful melding of flavors that created music in my mouth.We were also worried that portions would be small, but after one course and one appetizer each we were stuffed.Only down side was that the duck was too salty for my taste. Everything else, was perfect.

Review Text :
I am not happy with the co worker who introduced me to Forefathers.  Do I really need another way to feed my addiction to cheesy, beefy goodness?  Of course I do!This small restaurant in a Tempe strip mall has earned a special place in my heart.  No, not just because of the artery-strengthening cheese.  It is home to the best cheesesteak I have experienced since moving to AZ.While the menu offers a variety of choices other than cheesesteak sandwiches (chicken and even *gasp!* salads), I stick with what I know and love:Regular with Cheez Wiz ($7.35) - bring your appetite, because this sandwich is big!  A generous portion of thinly sliced meat and that oh so important Cheez Wiz is nestled within a soft bun.  It is gooey, drippy and messy.  Perfect.  If Wiz is not for you, it is also offered with white American cheese, Provolone or Mozzarella.  While I prefer mine with just the basic meat and cheese, you healthy types can also get any combination of 'OMG' - onions, mushrooms and green peppers.Fries are a very nice compliment to the sandwich.  Let's be honest here, fries are a very nice compliment to nearly anything.  Forefathers' fries ($2.55) are hot, salty and crisp.  If you haven't gotten your fill of Wiz on your sandwich, you can turn those fries into Cheese Fries ($2.95).  Either way, be sure to grab a container of 'fry sauce' (I am guessing this is some blend of ketchup and mayo).  One taste and you will want to put this on everything.  Lucky for me and my cholesterol level, this gem is nowhere near where I live.3.5 stars!  Came here on whim when this other cheesesteak spot we wanted to try out was closed for the day.  We had a long day of furniture shopping ahead of us and we needed to fill our tummies.  Enter Forefathers!The establishment itself is very clean and modern.  The staff was patient while we studied the menu and they seemed like a happy bunch.  I had ordered a regular cheesesteak  provolone and some plain crispy fries .  I almost regret not getting it with Cheez Whiz and OMG style but I figured I didn't need all that cheese filling me up and onions and peppers just didn't draw me in.  I did end up having to dump some fry sauce into my cheesesteak after the provolone got cold and it became a bit dry to eat.  I think this sandwich had great flavor and it's pretty hefty and filling.  The price is a bit steep but you do get a lot of meat [although not fresh].  It's a solid and decent cheesesteak.

These far-reaching Gods of Cafetopolis you see, Whose minions such as Paneracles and Chipotle have erected from sea to sea,Desired like the vendors beyond the Acropolis offerings,Cafeteria dining serving Gyro and many such things,The fare was befitting of above mentioned ilk,Two stars at best though service was silk,The dolomades came hard the hummus was tasty,Spanakopita came fried as the cooks may be hasty,Falafel were shaped as tater-tots would,Pasty inside the two were not good,Salad lacked olives but for a dollop all ground,Feta was sparse with no pungency found,Drachmas went quickly when food was just ordered,Higher quality Greek food the price could have afforded(English majors...was that iambic pentameter?)

Are you kidding me?  Seriously.If you like less than mediocre food while porn is being thrown in your face, you'll find it here.  Seriously.We never would have gone in here if we had any idea.  Seriously.Corporate Suits in town wanted to take a few folks from my office to lunch and chose this place.  There's an hour of my life I'll never get back.  Seriously.This place makes Hooters look very upscale and classy.  Seriously.  And the food.  Huge burgers and fries are the only choices.  The burgers?  Think Encore Frozen Salisbury Steaks on a bun.  Seriously.We left with the unanimous agreement that none of us would ever see the inside of this place again.  Seriously.I walked in with my sister and my boyfriend.  We wanted to see a menu before sitting down.  We were greeted by someone in a way-too-tight nurse's costume.  Every single man in the place turned around and stared at us.  Every man in there sat alone at the counter with a beer.  I wondered if we had accidentally walked into a strip club, based on the layout, the customers, and the wait staff.  The little nurse politely but loudly told us the menu was painted on the wall.  Heart attack burgers, "flat line fries", unfiltered lucky strikes and buckets of beer.  That's it.  So we turned around and politely walked out as fast as we could.Wow!  Are there no reviews of this place, yet?  Okay, this is a funky, fun concept for a restaurant.  First of all I need to let you all know the food is great, although one might not want to eat it every day.  The menu fits on one business card, so the choices are simple. Nothing is diet at all, and the french fires are fired in lard.  BUT, the food is soooo good.  The concept is cute too.  The cooks are dressed as doctors, and the waitresses are dressed as nurses a la Tim Curry as he was dressed in the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  It sounds weird, but I recommend everyone who loves a great burger try the Heart Attack Grill in Phoenix.  Get thee there!  Yum!This place = Failtown, USA.My friends and I went in a while back to check out what all the hype was about this place.  Sure, it seemed like it was a Hooters knockoff (replace wings with burgers), but we had some hope that this establishment would be legit. WRONG.The waitress informs one of my buddy's that if he finishes some sort of monster glutton burger then the meal was on the house.  Well sometime later, after putting that entire burger away, we get the check and notice the burger was still on the check.  We bring it up with the waitress who beats around the bush.  We then ask for the manager, who was VERY non-compliant.  After the discussion turns into an argument (wow real professional on your part Heart Attack Grill), he threatens to "call the cops if we don't leave and we better or else he's going to jump over the counter and punch us in the face."SO MUCH FAILRegardless of whether the food was good or not (nothing spectacular), I am NEVER going back there again nor would I recommend anyone else to do so.  There's a Red Robin a mile west on Warner that has a full bar and burgers just as gluttonous with unlimited steak fries to boot.  If I could give this place 0 stars (along with AIDS, Herpes, Cancer, and a slow fiery death), I would.DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPEAhhh the infamous Heart Attack Grill. Listen, I am all for food that is bad for you. There is a place in this world for it, and I will defend that place in the world as I would defend my own country from invasion. However, when food is not good for you, it better taste good. This is the failure of the Heart Attack Grill. -When a burger is 8000,6000,4000, or 2000 calories, it better be in the top 10 of all time burgers. This is more like the bottom 10. The burgers here are SOOOOOO GREASY. If I went back I'd ask them for some burger with my grease. Now let me say, I'm not that guy who wipes off his greasy food with a napkin and THEN eats. When I seek out grease, bring it on. But the burger is so thoroughly and completely greased inside and out that there is no burger taste. Pure disappointment. -The fries, cooked in pure lard, were actually excellent. I almost gave this place 2 stars for that, but then I realized this is actually why I am giving it 1 star. -I do like the coke bottled in Mexico with actual sugar, not corn syrup or whatever the hell we use here. That was a plus. -I don't smoke, so I did not partake of the unfiltered lucky strike lung darts. -The wait staff. Wow, they aren't wearing much. We had a cute waitress, who would sit on the counter, and my sister realized that more of her butt was in contact with the counter than not. She was playing the role well. Flirty, dingy. There were some other waitresses that were probably 20 years her elder. I will not comment further for fear it may incriminate me. -The atmosphere.....White and Red, like In N Out or 5 Guys Burgers. Wheelchairs for people who eat triple or quadruple bypasses. What no Lipitor? I would bet money that the scary dude who sat next to us ogling the cute waitress for an hour was registered in the state as a sex offender, or at least on some FBI watch-list. I will leave you with the following thought as you ponder my lack of recommendation for The Heart Attack Grill. Someone said this place makes Hooters look classy. ACTUALLY this place makes the Crazy Horse Too in Las Vegas look classy.One of the WORST experiences of my life.  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought, "hey wow, this is kinda cool" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had "cottage cheese" legs and thighs.  We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us "you either pay or i come over the counter" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways, don't go here.  Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard, are crap.  All in all, if you're a lonely loser, this is the place for you.  If you're a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food, go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied.I went to Heart Attack Grill after seeing it in the national nursing media headlines (they were putting this place down for creating a demeaning/sexualized view of nurses). So, of course, I had to go and see what the fuss was about. I walked in to the very small location, to find only 2 other tables with customers (older, unhygienic, obese men). The two waitresses on staff were less than appealing (and I'm the kind of girl that can look at an attractive woman and admit it) and the "cook" behind the counter, in the scrubs/doctor uniform looked like his clothes and hair hadn't been washed in more than a week. Went ahead and ordered anyways. Their menu consists of 4 burgers (single, double, tripple, or quadruple bypass bugers), flatliner fries, and soda... but no diet soda. Oh, you can also order a pack of Camel filterless cigarettes if your stash is running low. I ordered a single bypass burger, flatliner fries, and a coke. The burger was sub-par... very greasy and the fries were soggy and half cooked. The only positive thing I have to say is that I enjoyed drinking a Coke out of a cold glass bottle. I'd rather go to Hooters to see hot, half-dressed chicks... and I'd rather go ummmmm... ANYWHERE else to eat.There are quite a few unique things about this place, drinks are bottled water, bottled coke, Corona or Bud (there is no tap water as they have no glasses). There are really only two things on the menu, a burger (either Single, Double, Triple or Quadruple Bypass) with or without cheese and an endless order or fries. They had a toppings bar with pickles, jalapenos, tomatoes and onions but no lettuce (it's considered health food). There is mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup and vinegar but no hot sauce.For $499 you can get a membership and can eat 3 meals a day every day of the year if you'd like. Another schitck they have is if you weigh in excess of 350 lbs your meal is on the house (you can eat there 3 times a day if you please). And there is currently an eating challenge for an individual to complete a Quadruple Bypass in a single sitting but I don't think you receive anything. They have the fasted time at around 2:30 minutes currently.I ordered a Single Bypass with cheese and the french fries. The fries were tasty but not nearly as crispy as I'd like. They were quite limp which actually made it somewhat hard to dip them in the ketchup. They were extremely fresh though, they cut and make them almost non-stop throughout the day. However they are fried in lard and are extremely greasy.The burger was good but certainly nothing I couldn't whip up at home. Mine was slightly undercooked for my liking but not enough to have them recook it. They use a 70/30 beef to fat patty, which for me is too much. On top of that they add pork fat while cooking and dip the buns in  pork fat as well. As you can tell they're very much into excess here. For all the added calories there is not sufficient added taste.The whole thing is over-the-top and cheesy but I guess you can say you come here for the experience more than anything and for that it's more than worth the $10 and the food is at least acceptable. It's really more of a show than anything else. I was hoping to get to see someone attempt the Quadruple Bypass but sadly I didn't get to witness one. It's somewhat strange but families, with young children, tend to eat here a lot too. I don't know how I'd feel about bringing my kids here, not quite the right place. The staff and the crowd was quite enjoyable. I'd eat here occasionally if I lived near by, if only for a good time.I have photos and a more in depth review on my personal blog.And now ladies and gentlemen... the single worst establishment I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. Heart Attack Grill has ZERO redeeming qualities. There is not a single reason for me to even get close to giving this place anything more than one star. This is one place that makes me wish Yelp would allow a zero or negative star rating. Now, to preface this review... I'm not an idiot... I know that this place is "The Heart Attack Grill" so I went in prepared for greasy and unhealthy food but hoped it'd be fun and even though unhealthy, maybe taste alright. Whoa, was I ever wrong to hope for that. They group their burgers by how many patties there are... starting out with the Single Bypass burger (one pattie) and going up to the Quadruple Bypass burger (four patties). Being a little more on the conservative end, I went with the Single Bypass burger and a side order of fries. My Dad came along for the fun and he got the same... for the purposes of this review I should tell you that my Dad is a machine, he can eat... and he doesn't mind a little grease. Right as they bring our food out, I immediately get intimidated. The patty of the burger was dripping with fat and the meat used was such low quality (extremely high fat/meat ratio) that the patty didn't even appear to be beef... it had this whitish tint to it that you'd have to see to believe. I've never seen such an unhealthy piece of beef in my life... it doesn't help that they cook it in pure lard either. This was beyond unhealthy, it was disgusting. I feel like if you're making something blatantly unhealthy there should at least be a method to the madness; there should be some attempt at wanting to make it actually taste good (it is food by the way). It just seemed like they were pushing the grease and lard to the absolute maximum just to see how far they can take it. Well I'm not impressed... I took one bite and was instantly grossed out, I actually almost threw up it was so bad. My Dad who can hang with the best of 'em was able to stomach about three bites until he could no longer continue. The second we left the place I turned to my Dad and said "that's the worst single piece of food I've ever put in my mouth". I'm not exaggerating when I say that I'd rather eat a dried up piece of dog shit between two buns than a Heart Attack Grill burger. The only thing worse than the food is the tacky and over the top waitresses. They wander around in little nurses outfits often times with their underwear quite visible, and their whole bar area has a slanted mirror to actually encourage you to look up their skirts. That'd be fine and all, except I didn't want to look up these skirts. If you're going to have your wait staff dress sexy, you better make sure they're worth looking at in the first place. These girls were a little rough around the edges... most of them had that 'ex-stripper' look; and I could have sworn that one of them had bullet wounds on her stomach... that's not a joke.P.S. I actually dry heaved while writing this review just thinking about my fat drenched burger. DO NOT GO HERE.Great idea, but fail execution.Well... I don't know about great, but it is certainly an interesting idea. Almost clever. Going here was my friend's idea - it was either this or get that gastronomical abomination from KFC where they give you a bacon and cheese sandwich and then replace the bread with deep fat fried chicken. I don't like KFC, so I went with this. My choices might as well have been a kick in the face or a stomp on the nuts.I didn't know what to expect. We walk past the ambulance into the restaurant. The air was thick inside. Oily. I quickly notice that everyone is wearing hospital gowns while devouring their meals. If peopleofwalmart.com was a movie - this would be the cast. We found ourselves seats and were greeted by a sweet young girl who put a hospital wristband on us and then came around to put on our gowns. The place is staffed with cute girls in nurse costumes. I look down at the menu and the choices are called bypass - the severity varied by how many slabs of meat they put on. It was all kind of fun at first.I ordered the lightest thing on the menu - a single 1/2 pound burger - also an order of fries (which are unlimited refills) and a water... outside of water, my choices are sugar drinks or beer. My friend ordered a Double Bypass which was a pound of meat, also fries and also beer. The fries were cooked in lard - they didn't taste too bad, but were not crispy or special at all. They just weren't worth getting up for seconds. Soggy, floppy and flavorless... just something to deliver salt to my stomach.The burger arrived in a paper tray looking like a sad heap of grease. The bun was glistening - soaked with grease. Butter? Lard? Motor oil? I couldn't be sure, but the first bite told me I didn't want a second. I peeled the top bun from the burger and plopped it in the tray. I attempted to take another bite or two, but couldn't take it. The meat was sub-par shitty, fatty grocery store beef. The cheese was cheap tasting as well. Not that I expected wine and caviar, but for food this cheap and shit tasting, I wouldn't expect to pay so much. I didn't eat more than a few bites of the burger and I didn't touch the fries much, but I still felt both full and hungry at the same time. I pretty much just ate a few pickle slices and drank a bottle of water. The waitress asked how I liked it - my friend loved it and said he would've had seconds. I said it was terrible and that I was dissatisfied. I didn't ask for any money off the bill and she didn't offer it either. Even though I didn't eat it, she charged me 12 bucks or whatever it was. I wasn't entitled to not having to pay or anything - I mean, I ordered it. I should've known what I was getting into. Still, many restaurants would've bent over backwards to make me happy. I can't really bust them down a star for this, but even if I could there's no option for negative stars. Heart Attack Grill served me one of the worst burgers I've ever had. The novelty of it wore off as soon as my food arrived. If you want to eat an unhealthy yet savory burger/fries meal - go to in'n'out burger.I will never eat here again. I like greasy food sometimes, but I would rather eat a stick of butter and wash it down with bacon grease. Seriously - fuck this place. Then again... my friend loved it, so you never know.I travel with a competitive speech team. We were recently in Arizona for a competition, and my team HAD to stop at the Heart Attack Grill- a member of my team is doing a speech about it, we couldn't get away without seeing the place firsthand!Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted by a smell that can accurately be described as "Fat, grease, and charred death." You know the smell that sometimes comes out of a burger restaurant- the slightly-singed, but otherwise-delicious smell of meat being grilled? This was a sick amplification of that. The smell alone was enough to drive several members of our party to pursue other options for dinner.As far as decor, the restaurant does a good job of sticking to an anti-doctor theme, with signs plastered all over the restaurant warning you of the unhealthy nature of their food, mandatory patient gowns for all diners, and waitresses dressed as cute nurses. But the food itself could be summed up with the word "Sickening," which actually works metaphorically and literally. Their shakes are incredibly sweet, but actually filled with ice cream, pure cream, and butter. Their fries are cooked in lard, and their burgers are excessively heavy and fattening. A burger and fries is really enough to fill up a fully-grown man, but the sensation of being completely filled by lard, meat, and grease is almost as disgusting as seeing one of the obese regulars scarf down a triple-bypass burger for free.The next morning, most of us who'd eaten there were still full. One of my friends said he "felt like [he] just blew the Hamburglar." Starting with the smell, and lasting all the way to the aftertaste the next morning, this anti-hospital is as novel as it is grotesque and excessive. I seriously almost threw up twice before I even tried anything, but I like to exercise and eat healthy. Other people didn't seem as disturbed by the place as I did, and to HG's credit, the things they serve actually maintain a stronger semblance to edible food than some other places I've eaten. It will definitely fill you up, and the theme is kind of cute.Nonetheless, I can't walk away from a restaurant feeling like I just destroyed my body and recommend it. I almost feel like the place is unethical for its  choice to give such flagrantly unhealthy meals. At the same time, the place is called HEART ATTACK Grill, and they don't make any effort to pretend they're doing anything other than providing the most unhealthy and disgusting food possible. With that, and the friendly service in mind, I can't justify any rating lower than 2/5. I'd definitely like this place more if they just used fresh ingredients, didn't cover everything in nastiness, and just stuck to making good burgers, fries, and shakes...but I realized that would just make them In-N-Out, and would kind of ruin everything this restaurant stands for.Disgusting? Yes.Necessary? No.Immoral? Decidedly no, since they clearly warn you about what you're getting in to.I'd eat here once, and NEVER again. It's a place fueled by novelty- go there only if you're inspired after watching Epic Meal Time on youtube.I will just be straight upfront; are they unhealthy, yes!! Is the fries cooked in pure lard, yes! Is the coke made from real sugar, yes!But you know what, even though this place is unhealthy it is defiantly a place to experience once in your life time. Where else can you go where waitresses dress up like nurses and serve you food, or doctors as cooks? A place where you have to where a hospital gown and a wrist band and there is no exceptions? Their really isn't any other place like this.It is true though it is really bad for you it sure does taste good! So if your in need of a good burger and fries and an experience to go with it this is the place to go!I am a sucker for a theme restaurant. I have been wanting to visit this place for a while because of their whole gimmick. When you arrive a nurse checks you in, gives you a hospital wrist band, and dresses you in a hospital gown. Seriously, I love a gimmick more than the next person but the Heart Attack Grill is 100% gimmick and only 60% good food. The menu consists of burgers which vary only in the number of patties, french fries fried in lard, shakes, pure sugar coke, and PBR. They have a strict no sharing policy which completely bummed us out because we wanted to order the huge 20 patty burger and split it 3 ways. We ordered 2 single bypass burgers (one of our trio boycotted the burger because of the no sharing policy,) all you can eat lard fries, a vanilla shake, full sugar coke and a PBR. The burgers were ordinary, the fries were ordinary, and the service (aside from being dressed as naughty nurses) was ordinary. The only win was the delicious butterfat filled vanilla shake. The bill came to around $30, which is a bit pricey because remember only two of us actually had food. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. It is a gimmick. Heart attack, fat, lard, waitresses dressed as nurses, cook dressed as doctors, sugar, beer...whatever. It gets old pretty fast.

Review Text :
WOW this place is awesome! i came here for an anniversary dinner with the bf on a wed night. we had reservations at 7pm, but even though we got there early, we were still seated right away in a cozy little booth. the decor is modern with lots of browns and dimmed lights and the vibe just felt cool haha...we were probably the youngest diners in the restaurant but for a wednesday night, the place was pretty packed.our server, Carlos was attentive, efficient, and super friendly. he was able to describe the meats and wines to us and offered great recommendations. after much deliberation, we skipped the starters (since they do give you a good amount of bread) and went straight for the meat! i opted for the American Wagyu Filet ($80) and it was delicious! it was cooked perfectly medium rare and yes it was 'charred', but nothing extreme and the meat didn't taste burnt or anything like that. lots of yelpers complained about the saltiness of the meat, but i thought the seasoning was just right...in fact, they served my steak with a side of extra salt just in case i needed more haha. our side dishes of wild field mushrooms and yukon potato puree were just right to compliment the steak. in addition to the awesome food, the service was impeccable, our wine and water glasses were always filled and i swear just as we had finished up our meal, our plates were cleared in an instant. we were checked up on and i never felt like i was rushed. another plus was our complementary dessert. the words "happy anniversary" were spelled out in chocolate and served alongside 4 different crackers/cookies...it was quite a pleasant surprise since i wasnt expecting anything like that. overall this was a sensational dining experience! everything was spot on and i'll definitely have to save my money for my next visit to CUT hahaPros: Taste of New York Sirloin (the Japanese Wagyu 2 oz. specifically), cool decor, really nice server named CarlosCons: None?I went here with Kristin C. for our 2 year anniversary dinner last week and I was definitely impressed. The decor was really nice in here.  It had a modern feel. The lights were dimmed which created a very relaxing and intimate setting. Perfect for a romantic dinner. We got a nice booth and a really attentive server named Carlos.Decor is nice and all, but we all know the food is really what matters.  After we ordered, another waiter came around with a platter of different breads. I got one wheat bread and one pretzel type bread. Apparently, the pretzel bread is their specialty. I could definitely see why. It was soft and delicious.For my main course, I ordered the "A Tasting of New York Sirloin" ($140). It comes with different types of New York sirloin:- Japanese Wagyu From Saga Prefecture 2 Oz- American "Kobe Style" From Snake River Farms 4 Oz- U.S.D.A. PRIME Dry Age From Nebraska 4 OzAll 3 steaks were really tasty. Definitely, some of the best steaks I've had in my life. However, the best out of the 3 was definitely the Japanese Wagyu. So freaking good. It was nice and tender. My steak knife cut through it like butter. I can see why they only give 2 oz. too. Two reasons: 1) its the pricest per ounce and 2) I think since it's sooo rich and tender, if you get too much, it might be too much of a good thing.We also got potato puree and mushrooms as sides and they were good too. But seriously, the steaks made my night.  Hanging out with Kristin C. was cool too I guess :)Overall, this place is great for special occasions. I might just have to go to CUT in LA just to get my Japanese Wagyu fix.This place is ... interesting. You're seated on fancy, swiveling conference room chairs inside a really swank space (Vegas restaurants kick LA restaurants' asses in this respect). Maybe Wolfgang thought the restaurant was too pretty for a steakhouse and decided to add more manliness to the establishment by hiring a wait staff completely devoid of uteruses. These men in black are awesome, though, and the service is what you'd expect for a meal that costs as much as an Ikea sofa.Meal-wise this place is all about the Wagyu, Japanese or American. If you don't get this looking at the menu, they hammer the point home by carrying an armload of Wagyu to your table, so they can dazzle you with the marbling. I've had Japanese Wagyu in both Japan and the States, and while I've come close to weeping with joy several of those times, I didn't feel compelled to shell out $160 for an 8oz rib eye. So I went with a 20 oz bone in rib eye from Illinois, much to the chagrin of our waiter. The girlfriend got an American Wagyu sirloin. My rib eye was decent, but not great (Damn you, Illinois!). The American Wagyu, however, was awesome. The appetizers were okay, but the side dishes were amazing. I found it annoying that they charged for sauces. They bring you an assortment of sauces for free anyway. Can't tell you about dessert, because we were so stuffed that even an extra molecule of soufflé would've given me a hernia.One of the best steakhouses in Vegas.  One of the few to serve Japanese Kobe beef.Only had the privilege of trying this place twice in the past six months.  No reservations either time (we just walked in after a successful day of poker at the Venetian.)  No problems.Service was outstanding (although we are biased since we knew some of the servers).The ambiance is very modern yet comfortable.  You know you are in a new American steakhouse.The appetizers were very good but not memorable.  This is because the steaks are the focus of this restaurant.  Servers will come to your table and show you the different cuts and grades of beef before you place your order.  I was ready to eat the steak raw at that moment.  Strongly recommend the American Kobe.  This cut is not as rich as the Japanese Kobe but based on the portion size, no one can finish the Japanese Kobe.  Prime steaks are OK but common, you can get that in your home town. As always, we skipped the sides.  The focus in on the steaks.One note, be careful with the amount of bread you consume.  It's easy to fill up before you even get to the steaks.  The soft pretzel is outstanding and the breadsticks are so crisp that I showered my guest twice with crumbs; sorry.The wine list is well chosen and includes many of the trendiest boutique wines from the new world.  Watch out, you can easily overspend.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.This seems to be one Wolfgang restaurant that isn't suffering from the Celebrity Chef Syndrome. You know... that ailment that seems to affect many restaurants on the Strip. The one where a celebrity chef opens an outpost in Sin City only to neglect it and have the quality of the product suffer as a result. As an example see Spago and Postrio or other celeb restaurants like Mesa Grill. Cut bucks the trend successfully by offering some amazing steaks and fabulous accompaniments.While I didn't think the cheese ball amuse bouche was anything special, the bread selection was very good. Particularly good were the pretzel bread and focaccia. The fresh burrata (with prosciutto, raisin-rhubarb compote, and arugula) wasn't something that was very memorable. The cold, stringy consistency of the cheese wasn't appetizing and the subtle flavor made the dish forgettable. The maple glazed pork belly, however, was an unbelievable mix of sweet and savory flavors. It could have benefitted from a little more pork fat to add to the texture and taste, but overall it was one of the best pork dishes i've had in a while.For our entrees we had an 8 oz. petit cut filet and the 16 oz Nebraska corn fed rib eye. We ordered some wild field mushrooms with the filet and got a side of fingerling potatoes to share. We ordered both medium rare but the filet came out closer to medium. They were both beautifully charred, providing a flavorful crust to the steaks while keeping the centers juicy and tender. Service was solid, although our waiter did disappear for a few stretches. However, the guy refilling our water was always around. It seemed like after every sip of water he was there to fill it back up to the top.The decor is hip, trendy, and modern. Quite a contrast to most other steak houses in Las Vegas. The music was more safe and mainstream, as they played a lot of U2, the Beatles, Rolling Stones, and Cold Play.They give locals a 20% discount off of food, so if you are Nevada resident make sure you ask about it when you order.4.5 StarsMy friend wanted to have one really nice dinner for his Vegas bday weekend.  We all love steak, so we decided to make reservations at CUT.  I had just dined at Alexander's( http://www.yelp.com/biz/alexanders-steakhouse-cupertino#hrid:zgOk0ixxx8Fog1FdFDMgKA/src:self ) a few weeks prior and LOVED it, so I had super high expectations for CUT.  We had a party of eight, so we called in for reservations ahead of time. Service here is definitely outstanding.  There were so many servers waiting on us, I couldn't keep track.  Our water glasses were always full, and your napkin would always be folded if you got out of your seat.  Our waiter brought out a platter to display the different cuts of wagyu beef....Kobe vs. American...so we could see the different marbling.    For my first course, I ordered the Roasted Baby Beets, Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese, Pistachio, Citrus, Micro Basil,  & Mint.  I originally was going to get the USDA Prime bone in rib eye steak, but it was only $20 more for the American Wagyu rib eye....I was sold.  I added the wild field mushrooms to top off my lovely piece of steak.  Our table also ordered Sautéed Baby Spinach, Soft Polenta with Parmesan and Tempura Onion Rings.My beet appetizer had a very nice presentation.  It was very colorful, and all of the ingredients complimented each other very well.  All of our sides were very tasty.  The polenta was nice and creamy, onion rings were crispy, and the spinach added the "healthy" factor to our meal.They prepare the steaks over a hard wood and charcoal grill and then finish them off in a broiler.  My steak was cooked to a nice medium rare, and it melted in my mouth.  The steak had great flavor, but I didn't really care much for the charred flavor from the broiler.  The wild mushrooms I added went well with my steak and kept it moist from the sauce.  I wasn't able to finish my steak and gave it to my friends who had the USDA Prime rib eye.  They were amazed and could totally tell the difference from the Wagyu.The only disappointment I had here was that they didn't have foie gras as an add on to your steak.  I was spoiled by Alexander's, and left the restaurant craving that melt in your mouth foie gras.  I was so expecting a 5 star dinner here, but I just couldn't give it to them.  Please add foie gras to the menu!Nothing says love like red wine and redder meat.  Wow. 3rd most expensive dinner we've had in LV with Nobu and Picasso at 1 and 2. Decided this would be a nice splurge for our 3 year wedding anniversary and it certainly was. I was glad I read a bunch of Yelpers reviews before going as it made it MUCH easier to choose what to get and all that. We went with a 9pm rez after seeing Phantom. Both of us had intentionally skipped lunch in anticipation and I even went to the gym 3 days in a row haha. The atmosphere was pretty loud. Not exactly the most romantic place but no big deal. The vibe was more fitting for the HRH all-suites tower than Palazzo. Got a booth instead of the stupid swivel chairs thank god. Wife started with the kobe beef sashimi which was awesome. Pretty much the best carpaccio ever. I could've just eaten the beef sushi-style. I got the big eye tuna tartare after reading everyone's recommendation and it certainly did not disappoint. After reading SO many raves about it..I went with the 10 oz American Kobe ribeye. Wow! You gotta love the marbled, fattiness of the beef. My wife got the regular filet which was also excellent and the difference in how both meats tasted was really interesting. We could only manage to eat half of our steaks but I'm SO looking forward to the leftovers today!!  The price of the mac and cheese was ridiculous. I was looking for an asterisk on the menu that said it came with a foot massage or something...tasted awesome anyways. Also went with the broccoli rapini for the other side. Went well with everything. Skipped the sauces and didn't miss them. FYI..they don't do a locals discount anymore. Whatever..no one comes here to save money. We've been to so many steakhouses in LV....I can't say it was the best one we've been to but it was really great.Two years and 15 more visits since my last review proves in my mind that Cut is the Pantheon of steak.  The Kobe steak sashimi with spicy radish garnish is a perfect way to sample the high quality of the beef.  The fat literally melts in your mouth.  Their take on a steak tartare with herb aioli is equally good.  A modern redo of a classic.  Finally, the bone marrow flan is to die for.  (I really like the veal tongue but don't want animal activist to think I'm heartless).Now the beef.  This is a true steak lovers paradise.  All of the steaks are beautifully aged, trimmed.  All are prime and above.  All steaks are at least partially grilled over charcoal for the perfect bitterness.  The steaks:-  Illinois corn fed aged 21 days - Good beef flavor.  Bone in cuts are better.- Nebraska corn fed 35 days - Deep beef flavor. Very nutty.  Strong umame.  Not for everyone but outstanding if you like very good aged beef.  The rib eye is the top pick.-  American wagyu - Truly outstanding.  Tender and buttery.  The cuts are small but with the incredible richness, more than enough food.  Do not order this beyond medium rare or it dries up and is a waste.  The rib eye is the most flavorful cut.- Australian wagyu - Wow. Nuff said.First time visitors should try the tasting of new york sirloin.  It offers an outstanding selection and gives the opportunity to try different super grades of beef.Finally, the braised short ribs deserve special mention.  If you want something different, this is it.  It is Indian spiced so a bit different but absolutely fall of the bone tender.I have never tried their sauces, toppings, or sides.  Naked steaks are best to me.The wine list remains extensive.  Prices are good.To those wanting the absolute best in beef, Cut is without a doubt it.After my outstanding experience here, it goes without saying that Wolfgang Puck's take on steaks is a "cut" above the rest!Tucked inside the Palazzo resort, Cut exhibited a refined contemporary appeal and warmth that was both inviting and comforting.  I especially enjoyed the service by Tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. After allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and I must say, they all looked enticing! Shortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads I've come across. Parmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of Parmesan breading on the outside.Bone Marrow Appetizer - From the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. Simply unbelievable. If there's one single dish from this entire trip, I will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!Steak Tasting American Kobe Style from snake river - paired with a house steak sauce. The beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. The tangy flavor of the steak sauce was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. Let it be known, I'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!USDA prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the New York, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. Honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. Australian wagyu from Blackmore -Worthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. It's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. The best steak I've ever had. It came with a béarnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. It was perfect all on its own.White corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish DessertBaked Alaska - Tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. Btw, that's a good thing!  It also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!Banana Creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. Now that's what I call a triple chocolate threat! Having said that, It was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which I really enjoyed.Before we left, Tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! Service was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. But i'd have to say Tara made all the difference! She transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!Bravo to CUT for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! You bet ill be back for an encore! Until then...Happy Eats!Cut remains one of the top steakhouses in Vegas.  Why the update?  The return of real Japanese beef to the menu.Excess Foodie Trivia:  Japanese Wagyu beef varies in quality and flavor depending on sub species, rearing, and environment.  There are dozens of Wagyu "brands", the top being Matsusaka Ushi (virgin females fed rice and beer, massaged daily producing extremely deep even marbling, whose fat is the only one that melts at human body temperature).  Kobe with its rice like aroma and Omi with its viscous fat round out the top three.  Regardless of brand and ranking in Japan, all are far beyond the quality of the best USDA Prime.Back to Cut. Outstanding starters are modified seasonally.  I'm longing for Autumns return and the incredible carpaccio with celery hearts, truffle hollandaise and shaved white Alba truffles.  Perhaps the perfect version of a carpaccio, white truffles enhance the sweet, mineral beef flavor and the otherworldly white truffle hollandaise it's richness all surrounded by an umame fog of aromas.  The bone marrow flan is extremely rich, it's flavor sweetened by an earthy mushroom marmalade and brightened by an herbaceous, green parsley salad.   Excellent.To the beef.  All grilled over hardwood for a gentle smoked flavor and finished under a broiler.  Well seared, very evenly cooked, always to temperature.In general, bone in USDA prime cuts are gently aged deriving their beefy flavor from the bone.  Hearty beefy texture and deep beef flavor.  The boneless cuts have more aging and a nuttier, more pronounced umame goodness.  Slightly greasy, mouth feel and lingering flavor.  Very high quality AMERICAN steaks.  The American wagyu, very tender, sweet, mild beef flavor.  Extremely rich whose fat leaves a slight cloying mouth feel..Finally,  Japanese wagyu from Saga prefecture.  A4 quality.  Deep, even marbling.  Very sweet with a good beef flavor.  Extremely rich.  Very smooth mouth feel, the fat is not cloying having the viscosity of wine, not olive oil. Excellent.Many return visits, still no desert.Service remains Steakhouse refined and efficient.  The wine list remains excellent.Prices match the quality but hey, it's Vegas, all it takes is one spin.Oh Cut, I so wanted to love you! But unfortunately, I just like you. 3.5 stars.One of our friends had said this is his favorite steakhouse and he eats here every time he goes to Vegas. So for our annual Thanksgiving dinner, I suggested Cut as the place for my family to dine. We all walked away saying we would not come here again.Service - Top notch!Ambiance - This is a tiny restaurant and it's decorated nicely, but the music was classic rock and didn't really fit the feel of this place.The food - Hits and misses, which i'll get to.Price - About $1000 for eight people, which is pretty average for a steakhouse.Bread - You are given crispy breadsticks coated in parmesan. Tasty, but very messy, the parmesan flaked off all over the place. You are brought a plate of four choices of bread, you tell them which ones you want, and they are served to you by a waiter. I had the pretzel bread and the onion focaccia bread. Both were awesome. Starters - They don't have soup! I really wanted a soup, but there are none on the menu. Bummer. My friend ordered the Butter Lettuce, Avocado, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Champagne-Herb Vinaigrette Salad. I had a couple bites and it was very good. Steak - Our friend had told us to splurge and get the Japanese Wagyu Ribeye. It's $155 for 8 oz. He said it was well worth it, so BF and I split it. Japanese Wagyu is apparently not for me, it's just too buttery and literally melted in my mouth. I like steak I can chew on a little bit. I don't fault Cut, I just think it isn't my thing. My friend ordered a Petite Filet with Blue Cheese and I tried it, I liked his filet a lot and wish we had ordered that instead. Everybody else said their meat was okay.Sides - Brussels Sprouts - great flavor, but too undercooked for my taste. Not served very hot. Creamed Spinach topped with Fried Eggs - Just okay, also not very hot, and I could have done without the egg. Mac & Cheese - Good flavor, but the noodles were slightly gummy and also, this wasn't hot. Dessert - We didn't get any, but my friend ordered the Chocolate Souffle and it was amazing. Definitely the best part of the meal. It wasn't terrible, but there are so many steakhouses in Vegas, many of which I think are a lot better. When you are dropping $125 a person, you want to enjoy everything you eat, and that didn't happen here.man, pretty disappointedI had originally booked Delmonico's for D's bday dinnerbut at the last minute switched to CUT after I noticed that CUT had a wider variety of options to choose fromthe interior of the space was beautiful(ooh, we did see swizz beats and his posse there. but eh,not much of a fan after the AK/SB drama)the service was friendly but spotty and really slowwe ordered:20 oz bone in rib-eyedouble thick kurobuta pork chopwith a side of roasted brussels sproutsa glass of malbecand a glass of nikka whiskeyD loved his steak said it was the best he'd ever hadthe pork chop was good at initial bitebut lost its luster quicklythe brussels sprouts were average they brought out a carrot cake for D's birthdaywe both took one bite and put our forks downno buenoconsidering the reputation WGP hasI expected more unfortunately, my expectations weren't metglad D enjoyed his steakbut made me wish I kept my reservations at Delmonico'sIf you are steak lover and visiting Las Vegas you must give this place a try. I had the honor of dining here with several friends. Wow! What more can you ask for as a steak lover. I have to say you are going to be paying a lot for your meat. It's worth it all the way. I used to be big fan of Mastor's until I came here. Hands down the best steak money can buy.If you are a person who loves great meat and outstanding dishes. What more can you ask for as a steak lover.  It's worth it all the way. I used to be big fan of Mastor's until I came here. If you are from NY and love Keens Steakhouse in Manhattan then you need to long no place else.I highly recommend the bone in filet to the 8 ounce Kobe steak. If you are looking for great starters I would get pink Fiji peach salad or the butter lettuce. For side dished I would highly creamed spinach and roasted Brussels sprouts. Leave room for desert. The banana cream pie or the baked Alaska pear.Service 10+Quality 10+The creme de la creme of steakhouses.A group of friends and I had an open Sunday, so we decided why not do a fancy dinner. CUT was our pick. Seating was a breeze. Made reservations on OpenTable and got seated at a large round table in the back when we arrived. It was like our own little area. It's difficult not to leave impressed. The waiters and waitresses are amazing here. SO attentive. They offered a variety of complimentary breads on a tray and we were able to select as little or as many as we wanted. Get the focaccia for sure. That was the favorite among the table.I can only speak for what I personally ordered... The U.S.D.A. Prime Rib Eye Steak 12 oz ($59). It was delicious!! Cooked to perfection with a fine crust to give it that extra texture but, be warned, there's tons of fat. On the plus side, fat equals flavor! You can also choose from a list of sauces to compliment your meats. I got to try their Armagnac and Green Peppercorn as well as the Spicy Red Chimichurri ($2 each). Both tasted great with the rib eye. One was enough for 2-3 people. I had a ton left over.All the meats are served a la carte. The table got a double order of Mac & Cheese ($19) and it was TO DIE FOR! So glad we got a double. We also shared an order of their Creamed Spinach ($12) and Wild Field Mushrooms ($22), which were just alright to me. One order for seven people left everyone with only a couple bites of each side. You can see in the attached pictures.Wolfgang Puck knows how to do fine-dining well. The atmosphere is elegant and perfect for celebrations or a nice date. Just wished it didn't dent the wallet so much. I always cringe a little when I see that four $$$$ sign, but you're paying for quality I suppose!Definitely one of the best meals I've had in Las Vegas! Wolfgang Puck has really outdone himself!The rub that is used on the steaks is amazing; it was flavorful and not overly salty. The rub really enhanced the perfectly cooked steak. While the steaks at CUT are amazing and so delicious, I was most impressed by the non-beef dishes. The pork chop is probably the best pork dish I've ever had. It was so tender and delicious. I could have eaten several orders of it! The rotisserie poussin is also fantastic. The meat was super juicy and the truffle-laced sauce was so great. I was so tempted to lick the dish clean. The best part was the great service. Our server was awesome. He was super professional but not snobby. He kept us smiling all night. CUT is definitely now one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. I can't wait to go back.Okay - the food here is absolutely delicious. The Ribeye was so unbelievably tender, and even more delicious topped with bone marrow. The bone marrow dumpling and oxtail soup was flavorful, and the perfect start to the meal. The seafood 'lump' salad was refreshing and light.My only gripe (it was a big one) was the incident that happened at the end of our meal... my friend had brought cupcakes to celebrate a birthday, and was told over the phone it was a $14 flat rate. The cupcakes came, we sang happy birthday, and went along our merry way. However... when the bill came, it was a whopping $168 for a cake cutting fee.$168... are you freaking kidding me? For 12 CUPCAKES? Absurd. A few things...1. You don't cut a cupcake - everyone knows that2. When we spoke to the manager, he said he had spoken to my friend on the phone that day and told her about the $14 per person cake cutting fee - which was a lie... my friend had spoken to a different representative weeks ago3. Desserts at the restaurant aren't even that much4. If we had known about the absurd fee, and it had been communicated to us, we wouldn't have brought in the cupcakesAnyways. 5 stars for food and service, but the cupcake incident was a serious debbie downer for our meal. As a restaurant that charges a premium for food and service, they really need respect their customers more.When you charge $65 - $105 PER steak, the experience has to be out of this world; I was not blown away. If you plan on coming here, keep your expectations in check and have in the back of your mind that you're paying an additional 25% for the Las Vegas dining experience; if you do that, you'll be happy.Onto the highlights of our meal -- the service. My golly the service was spot-on. I felt like royalty dining with the Duchess of Cambridge. When you leave your chair and leave the napkin on the seat, they come by, remove and give you a fresh new one -- it's the attention to detail that makes the service amazing. The complimentary bread was fancy bread that was served table-side with a server placing each bread on your plate ever so gently. However, it was not warm bread -- stone cold bread. I was confused. Most high end restaurants serve bread warm because it just tastes so much better warm. Onto the reason we came: the steaks. 4 of us came here, we ordered the:1. [2x] American Waygu Ribeye 9oz ($88 each): This should have been the star of the show but it was not. Before ordering your steaks, the waiter actually brings raw steaks wrapped neatly and explains the different cuts of waygu and basically sells you on the more expensive cut. We ordered it. Call me a steak-snob, but for waygu, I was expecting melt-in-your-mouth bites -- it was more tough than I expected. It was only marginally better than the 35 dry aged ribeye, and certainly not $30+ better. 2. [1x] USDA PRIME, Nebraska Corn Fed, Dry Aged 35 Days Ribeye 12oz ($63): This was a solid cooked ribeye. No frills, no overselling. Delicious ribeye.3. [1x] Filet Mignon: This was surprisingly the star of the show. It was the melt-in-your-mouth experience I was expecting (and for a fraction of the waygu price). PROTIP (SERIOUSLY PROTIP): If you have a reservation, call ahead, ask to speak to a manager and ask him/her that you want to do "the sampling" of the waygu. If you're convincing enough, they will make a dish with a 2 oz cut of the regular dry-aged ribeye, 2 oz cut of the American waygu ribeye, and 2 oz of the Japanese waygu ribeye. (At least 2 people in your party have to order this) Had I known this going in, I would've done this so you can taste the differences in steaks.Pros: Service is impeccableCons: Oversold on the waygu (good steak, but not "out-of-this-world" great)CUT ranks among the top steakhouses in Vegas for me. SW and CUT are my go to places for a special occasion steak dinner.  My most recent visit was by far my favorite, and it probably had something to do with consuming 8 oz of Japanese Wagyu. I think it has ruined steak for me forever.My husband decided to take out one of his clients to dinner and we opted for CUT located inside of the Palazzo. The decor isn't mind blowing and it is pretty straight forward, but the food makes up for it. I also was not super impressed with our server.  We started off with a bottle of wine ($75 a Cab of client's choosing) and American Wagyu Beef Sashimi. The appetizer was okay, and I would probably opt for something else at my next visit. They brought bread regularly and although not overly busy, the service seemed very slow and almost disorganized. We were able to start a second bottle of wine by the time our server came by to take our full order and go into his spiel about different types of steaks, the marbling, aging process, etc. I went with 8 oz New York True Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef From Satsuma Prefecture, Kagoshima, Japan. It is initially offered at about $140 for the 6 ozs and then each additional 2 ozs are about $40. Well worth it getting the extra 2 ozs, and if you are splurging you may as well leave full. This was the most delicious piece of meat I have (or probably) will ever have. I know that I had a side as well, but everything faded out during that first bite of the buttery, savory goodness that was the steak. My husband had the American Wagyu and it was amazing how appreciable the difference in taste and texture was between the two. We topped off the great meal with some gelato. Well, I am glad my birthday is coming up!Items Selected:Pins & Needles - Tanqeray 10 Gin, Rosemary Syruo, Fresh Japanese Cucumber, Fresh Lemon Juice, Egg WhitePretzel Bread, Port and Walnut BreadGrissiniWarm GougeresMaine Peeky Toe Crab & Carolina Shrimp Louis Cocktail, Spicy Tomato HorseradishBone Marrow Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley SaladMaple Glazed Pork Belly, Asian Spices, Watercress, Sesame-Orange Dressing, Nectarine CompoteYukon Gold Potato PureeTempura Onion RingsAsparagus with Hazelnut Brown ButterSoft Polenta with ParmesanCavatappi Pasta Mac & Cheese with Quebec CheddarSampler of Meats - 1oz True Japanese 100% Wagyu from Miyazaki Prefecture, 3oz Snake River Farms American Wagyu, 3oz USDA 35-Day Dry Aged Prime Nebraska Corn Fed Beef with Housemade Steak Sauce, Bernaise, Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho ButterDouble Espresso over IceValrhona Chocolate Souffle - Whipped Crème Fraiche, Chocolate Sauce, Gianduja Ice CreamMixed Berry Crumble - Toasted Almond Crumble, Lemon Verbena GelatoMascarpone Cheesecake - Blueberry Compote, Brown Butter Cookie CrustPeach Melba Frozen Yogurt Baked Alaska - Peach and Raspberry Compote, White Chocolate Buttermilk CakeBanana Cream Pie - Crème Brulee, Chocolate Sauce, Roasted Banana Ice CreamCaramel and Peanut Ice Cream Bar - Valrhona Chocolate Brownie, Peanut Brittle, Salted Caramel SaucePecan Financiers and Chocolate Chip CookiesGelees, Marshmallows, Nougat, Chocolates, Nutella MacaronImpressed by CUT during a visit several years ago while a medical student visiting Beverley Hills, it was largely a love of neighboring Carnevino and the lackluster service at Wolfgang Puck's Las Vegas locations that had previously precluded a meal at CUT within the Palazzo, a two-hour feast with five friends on a busy Friday night showing textbook execution of pristine ingredients with an almost unthinkably high waiter-to-table ratio.One of the most bustling and vibrant dining rooms in Las Vegas, the energy high as well-dressed tourists decorated every seat in the house with the bar stacked two-deep, it was at a large six-top in the center of the room that our party was seated and with one captain directing a team of at least a half-dozen at our table alone it was not long before water was poured, menus were presented, and cocktail orders began flying.Appropriately described as 'sexy,' the cubed glass, polished surfaces, and low lighting likely to make anyone appear a bit more interesting, attractive, or both it was with an herb-forward elixir costing nearly $20 that I listened to the captain describe several specials and inquiring as to whether the off-menu "sampler" was still available the answer was confirmed as 'yes,' the grissini and gougeres offering contrasting textures of cheese before my favorite piece of ancillary staff, the bread man, arrived.Trying to go easy on pretzel batons and boozy purple bread studded with nuts it was after a short delay filled with chat that appetizers arrived and with a diverse group deferring to my order the crispy glazed pork belly was an undeniable favorite while seafood lovers relished in the fact that two of the party opted not to partake in the reference standard "Louis," the almost-signature bone-marrow a creamier take on the traditional version with bones stuffed by a cloud-light whip nicely complimented by bitter salad and aromatic yet sweet jam.Intrigued by non-steak items including a pan-roasted lobster, chops, and sole it simply seemed illogical to pass on a sampling of Puck's well-sourced Cuts as the primary focus of the meal and offered a total of 7oz for a steep $125 suffice it to say each bite was taken with due indulgence, the corn-fed aged meat from Nebraska the sort of steak that would wow in any number of US Cities while the Snake River American and Japanese A5 Wagyu were exceptional even by Las Vegas standards, the portions actually quite appropriate when taking into account the richness of each.Mostly underwhelmed by sides, the price-to-portion ratio bordering on ridiculous for potatoes, macaroni, and onion rings while the polenta and asparagus were at the very least well-prepared enough  to raise eyebrows a bit, when the time came for desserts the 'all-in' approach was taken, not a single one of the offerings less than delicious with surprisingly sharable portions; the souffle a proudly-standing classic while innovative takes on Baked Alaska and Banana Cream Pie each balanced fruit and chocolate nicely, the crumble simple and as good as rustic restaurant desserts get.It's rarely that I go to a steakhouse only now with all the study done on "red meat" is bad for you and blah blah blah. Who cares, you only have one life to live and eat what you want. If it was up to me ill eat steak everyday... Unfortunately I don't have that kind of money to blow... Cut is expensive and by expensive it's not like your average expensive steakhouse... This here, is not the type of money you can blow on steakhouses unless you won a good amount in the casinos. The cheapest and smallest steak will cost you about $60... High 60s. I don't think I ever got treated to this luxurious fine dining. To spear my BF from hundreds of dollars I chose the cheapest cut and style of meat. The filet mignon, age dry to something days from some mid-west state. It was very tender and perfectly cooked. It didn't have much seasoning in it so you can taste just the meat, but they put sea salt on the table and a bunch of mustard. I don't get the mustard... They said it was a Austrian thing. But once you sprinkled some sea salt on, it was excellent. We also had the tuna tartare and it was amazing! Good recommendation by our waitress. If you're celebrating something or won big, come to cut for one of the finest aged steak!

Do you like cracker-like, ultra crunchy pizza crust? Then this is the place for you. The menu consists of salads, pizzas and I think a couple pastas and sandwiches. My sister and I came here for lunch with her two young boys (ages 5 and 3). It's the type of place where you order at a counter, they give you a number and then bring your food to you. There is a soda fountain with the usual suspects and some teas. My sister ordered the chicken Caesar pizza, I had the mushroom and pepperoni. My pizza was overly greasy and hers had to be eaten with a knife and fork. The crust is just ridiculous. I'm not kidding when I say it's like a cracker. Only mine got soggy from the grease.The boys did not like their food. The 5 year old had a cheese pizza, the crunch was weird to him and the black stuff on the bottom from the wood fired oven FREAKED HIM OUT. He picked off all the cheese and pretended to eat the pizza all while attempting to avoid the black stuff. The 3 year old had the grilled cheese and he sort of enjoyed it, barely. They use two types of cheese and press it in a panini, which is a little high brow for someone who still sometimes pees his pants. Overall, I sort of enjoyed it, but would not return.

Makin' it rain pig blood like it was Carrie's prom night!I do love me a nice big bowl of bun bo hue on a chilly evening.  Since it was raining cats and dogs Friday night,  we decided to go get some Vietnamese food before it got too warm for hot soup!  The dinner companions ordered their own pho, some spring rolls, and banh xeo to share but I was too star-struck with my giant bowl of red-colored Heaven.Sour, spicy, and oh so lemongrassy!  Even though I've never seen bun bo hue so red before, I decided to take a bite and it was bliss.  Admittedly they do go stingy with the pork blood, offering one dinky cube when other places pop in at least two, and the pork knuckle was given away so I didn't try it but the soup was flavorful and fragrant.  I ate every bite and drank most of my soup before the MSG and salt got a bit too much for me.  The spring rolls were also delicious especially with the peanut sauce and the banh xeo seemed to contain mostly bean sprouts.  I'd probably skip on the banh xeo next time.  The #10 pho with eye round and brisket was stated to be excellent with an aromatic broth that didn't even need hoisin sauce.  Great dinner!The restaurant itself is spacious and clean and the owner is super friendly along with the staff.  While the prices are on the higher end for the portion given, this is Chandler so don't be thinking you can get those Phoenix prices here.  The quality is there though.  Nonetheless, I'll be back for more bun bo hue!Since Spring Roll Factory closed several months ago, we've been thinking about trying to find a replacement that served delicious pork noodle bowls, and Pho Van does exactly that.  We stopped in yesterday for lunch and were greeted and seated right away.  I ordered a Vietnamese coffee and my husband ordered a Tsingtao.We started with their egg rolls which are nicely done.  Fresh, flavorful ingredients on the inside and fried nice and light so they weren't greasy.  Really enjoyed those.  I had the lemongrass beef noodle bowl and my husband ordered the BBQ pork noodle bowl.We were both impressed with the flavors of the meat and how tender it was.  The vegetables were nice and fresh too.  I love having a big pile of fresh mint to add to the dish.  The noodles were mostly ok, but a little clumpy.  His beer was good and cold in a frosty mug, and my coffee was nice as well, but it came in a smallish plastic cup full of ice.  I don't know if I'd order that again at $4.95.  Our server was friendly and helpful until the food was delivered.  Then we never saw her again.  We had to go up front to pay, and maybe that's the way they do it, but we never saw an itemized check or receipt.  We had no issues using the Yelp check-in offer of 10% off the total, but like I said, I have no idea what the itemized list was.Before tip and after the discount, the total was $32.11.   We saw several other interesting dishes go by our table and I look forward to trying more items on the menu.  I could see stopping in often for takeout on my way home from work.

So I admit I looked over my shoulder a bit when I went to this place...it's not an area I'd go to by myself.  But as most eateries go, this little hole in the wall was mighty tasty.A whole rack of baby back ribs is enough for two people and comes with two sides.  They smoke their own ribs and it's definitely evident in the taste.  The ribs were perfectly cooked and juicy with a nice tangy sauce that wasn't too sweet.  Besides ribs, they do brisket, chicken, st. louis ribs, etc.  They added a little brisket for free in with the order so that we could taste it, too.  The brisket was not as good as the ribs, but it had a good flavor.The mexican cornbread is moist and corny with bits of jalapeno in the mix just for a little bite.The corn on the cob...was cobby.The potato salad was cold mashed potatoes with hard boiled egg, peppers, and whatever else.  It looked like someone pre-chewed it for me.   Despite the strange look of it, it wasn't half bad.  I wouldn't call it the best I've had, by any means.The beans...ick.  At least in my opinion.  It just didn't seem to go with the bbq as well.The staff was very informative and the fact that they threw in something for free just so a customer could try it tells me that they are confident in what they do...and it shows in the food.Price wise they aren't cheaper than other bbq restaurants, although they do often have coupons which I wasn't able to find the other night, but I'll definitely look for them next time I go back.Ribliscious!

My fiance requested my presence at Voce last Tuesday night for a late dinner and entertainment from the Bad Sneakers band.I'd never heard of it before, nor had I ever been in the shopping center that it's located in.  Not the case for many 'regulars' there.  It was packed when we arrived!  FYI - they charge a $10 per person cover for their live music, so be prepared for that and you may also want to go early if you're planning a night at Voce to get a decent seat.  It was a fairly large menu - we had a tough time deciding what to order.  At our waitress's suggestion, we went with an order of the rigatoni with sausage and peas and a pizza la rustica.  Pasta was was great; pizza just decent.  Add wine and your meal can get pricey... $65 + tip for our date night.Check it out for their live music and intimate dining experience - it's not going to be a regular stop in the rotation, but I'd for sure return - especially for Bad Sneakers on a given Tuesday night.

My favorite vietnamese resto, not just a Pho place...I have been coming here for years. Back in the day, a bowl of Pho was around 5$, prices have gone up quite a bit since, but you can still get a good meal here with a drink for less than 20$ taxes and tips included, which is still a huge deal!!!The Pho really shine here, both the Chicken and Tai Nam variety. My tip for you is: ASK THEM TO PUT KAFIR LIME LEAVES IN YOUR PHO, no matter which option you pick. The lime leaves will bring out a new dimension to all the flavors... trust me just try it :) (I'm vietnamese and grew up eating this stuff). For me, this is the best Pho in town, it is consistently good. Pho is a very fussy thing to make well consistently, if you ever go to a pho place regularly you will notice sometimes the taste is off. For this place though when it's off it's still good, and when it's on, there's just no better.This place is famous for the Tay Ho special bbq dish,  (Bun cha Tay Ho), it comes with different types of grilled meats soaked in fish sauce, vermicelli and a heap of herbs, mix everything in a bowl and eat, the fun part is to mix different herbs each time, add some fish sauce and voila!!!Another signature dish is the "Cha ca" dish, it's grilled tumeric spiced fish on a hot plate, served with vermicelli and a heap of fried onions and dill. This one you eat with a shrimp paste sauce. The flavors in this dish is very pungent, definitely an acquired taste, be mindful if you want to try. But those who like shrimp paste, you will like this dish.Try also the iced coffee, viet style, yum.This is a pretty room, not fancy but bright without being fluo and comfortable and full of bowers of flowers that are probably fake but are white and pretty nevertheles. It's long and narrow with a big of outdoor seating in the summer months. The food is inexpensive and with super quick service and lots of delicious Vietnamese options on the menu beyond the usual Pho and mo' Pho. Not the best Vietnamese I've ever had but very fresh, authentic, and just as yummy as one might hope for. Brings back good memories of beautiful places and wise people who put days of love into a broth.

Review Text :
On a weekender to Vegas, my gf and I were hungering for sushi one night and the concierge of our hotel (Monte Carlo) suggested going to Yellowtail, the newest restaurant at the Bellagio.  Only open a week,  one might expect some hiccups along the way, but the food was top notch and the service was even more so.The outside entrance signals the restaurant's presence with a beautifully decorated, massive glass tile mosaic of a yellowtail fish.  Indoors, posh, elegant, with clean yet comfortable lines in a contemporary style. Seated at the bar (since we had no reservation), the service didn't slack one bit as our bar waitress was more than knowledgeable, explaining the vast menu choices and offering helpful suggestions on what to order.   Despite the busy atmosphere of having to juggle bar mixology and restaurant patrons, she checked up on us often and made us feel comfortable.  Food wise, my best description for this dining experience would be - sushi fusion.  Combining East and West sensibilities into sushi produced some unique flavor combinations that I've never tasted before.  I'm not talking about your typical California roll here.  Think banana flavored sake, strawberry topped rolls in place of unagi, Big Eye Tuna Pizza with shiso, Toro Sashimi with caviar and microgreens.  The crab dynamite was delicious with generous chunks of crab meat, and a hint of spiciness. One of their signature selections is the Grand Omikase, a six course tasting menu based on the chef's* fancy that day.  I would highly recommend this, as it's the most bang for the buck, and you get to taste a vast array of flavors.  Kobe beef fans will be satisfied as this includes  Washu beef (a domestic breed of Kobe) offered in a tenderloin cut; a texture that just melted in my mouth.Some might think sushi fusion is a bastardization against tradition, but I think it's fun.  Why not try something new?  Your palate might thank you for it.*(Head chef, Akira Back, has worked with industry greats such as chefs Nobu and Morimoto.)Situated inside the Bellagio, Yellowtail is a Japanese Sushi joint with flair, flair, flair.  It looks more like a small lounge than anything else, but they do serve food - and expensive food, at that.I don't recall how much the sushi costs, as I don't eat seafood, but the Jidori Chicken that I had was around $25.  When the waitress first brought it out, all I could splutter was, "THAT'S IT?!"  I mean, it LOOKED tiny.  But I was so hungry, I decided to just shut up and eat - and good thing I did!Turns out, it was really friggin moist, well seasoned, and actually a pretty hefty portion!  No complaints from me!However, the dish wasn't anything sensational.  The reason Yellowtail gets 5 stars is because..I was star-struck.Not by any celebrity sightings... but by waitress sightings.HOLY COW.  EVER SINGLE WAITRESS THERE WAS HOT HOT HOT!  I'm not just talking "pretty,"  I'm talking "HOT"!!!!  With MANY MANY exclamation points.  Hotness must be a requirement to work here!That's not to say that every waitress was a cookie-cutter Barbie.  Nope!  Brunettes, blonds, redheads, White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, tall, short, voluptuous, model-skinny, girly, tough, bitchy, friendly... The variety was endless - but in an oh-so-gorgeous kind of way.  Every single one of them.I'm not a lesbian, but even I got a little giggly around these girls.For sheer eye-candy alone... I have to give Yellowtail five stars!!!WHERE: Inside the Bellagio Hotel/Casino.WHEN: Dinner only! Monday-Thursday, 5pm-10pm. Friday-Sunday, 5pm-11pm. It is also recommended to make reservations during the weekend just incase it gets a little busy.WHY: The dishes are worth the while (or at least the ones that I got the pleasure to try tonight! =D)WHAT: So... first thing's first. I actually got home not too long ago from eating here.  Right after my amazing experience in this great atmosphere, the only thing I could think of was "I'm so going home and writing a review!" So here I am, and here I go...One of my good friends has been talking about how great everything was for the past year. So after a year, we finally got together to make it happen! Prior to getting to the restaurant, I was extremely giddy and excited!!When we got to the restaurant, checked in, and got seated, we automatically were asked what we wanted to drink. Tangent! Before I forget, customer service was at its best! Anyways, back to my experience. We weren't as hungry, so we all decided to get an appetizer each and share. =) That's what friends are for.FOOD: Keep in mind, the portions are small, but so worth your taste buds!We started off with Edamame.  There were 2 bowls, one with cold, salted edamame beans, and the other with a warm and cooked-in-some-good sauce (sweet chili) edamame beans. Always such a great starter!Eggplant Skewers:  One thing, I am not an eggplant fan, but I am not afraid to try it. My friend recommended I try this, and thank goodness she made that recommendation! It did not taste like eggplant at all. It tasted like bbq on a stick brushed with sweet miso and sesame sauce goodness. KUDOS!Big Eye Tuna Pizza:  Definitely not like your ordinary pizza! One of greatest things I have ever eaten! To simplify such a magnificent dish, it was smoked tuna on some type of cracker/bread (which made it a pizza). Everyone must try this! KUDOS!Popping Spicy Crab: Why come to a sushi joint and not order at least one roll?! We made the right choice. If like uniqueness in taste, be sure to taste this roll! Who would have thought that pop rocks (candy) can enhance a simple sushi roll?! It was magical! KUDOS!Lava Cake: For dessert (I always have my heart, mouth, and tummy ready for dessert), I was given the duty of choosing. I chose correct! To explain this lava cake, it was a small, dark chocolate-filled cake, topped with banana foam, and lychee ice cream on the side! Perfect amount, perfect taste, just pure perfection!To sum it all up, I had a wonderful time with my friends, the staff, and most definitely the food. We also got to say hello and converse with Chef Akira Back! He is very down-to-earth and such a great chef!I leave you with this. KUDOS, KUDOS, KUDOS!My hater-ass first reaction to this place was, "Oh Gawd, here we go..." Dim lighting, loungey club music, chi-chi decor and hostesses in slutty stripper-style Mandarin-collared minidresses (because Chinese, Japanese...whatever). Light Group runs this place, and the atmo reeks of pretentious Vegas douche.But once the food started coming, the truth is...it turned out to be FUCKING AMAZING!! I'm not a sushi snob; I'll eat grocery store California rolls and be happy as a pig in shit. But even my undistinguished palate could tell that this was truly exceptional food. (Someone else paid...if I'd had to pay, I probably would cut off a star or two for it being overpriced and pretentious...as I am wont to do :-)My friend and I shared lobster carpaccio, the tuna pizza (!!!!!!!FABULOUS!!!), Japanese snapper (!!!!YUM!!!), octopus sashimi, duck prosciutto (shockingly AMAZING, and I hate duck!!), tuna tataki, some kind of crispy pork roll, and another sushi roll that had pop rocks mixed into the rice (sounds weird, but was AMAZING!!). Every single thing was exceptional, but the ones I marked with exclamation points were pretty much orgasmically good. We had some good desserts, too.It didn't hurt that everything was washed down with a sake flight featuring 6 different types of sake...plus a shot of some cucumber vodka cocktail they feature that was incredible. I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 just because I can't in good conscience give a place this full of itself 5 stars. But srsly... I will MOST DEFINITELY come here again in a HOT MINUTE...as soon as I find someone else to pay for it!! Until then, I'll see you in the sushi aisle at Trader Joe's :-)Being completely honest, I'm usually not a fan of "special events," guest chefs, or the dumbed-down truncated experience of "Restaurant Week" but at $26 (after a deep discount from the quoted $100) with friends already planning on attending Chef Akira Back's "Chef's Tasting" at Yellowtail I tossed caution to the wind...only to reconfirm all the aforementioned prejudices to a whole new degree, leaving the event after 2 hours hungry, a touch intoxicated, and $26 poorer albeit richer in friendships."Spend the afternoon with us at YellowTail inside the Bellagio Las Vegas overlooking the spectacular fountains. Enjoy extraordinary culinary selections from Chef Akira Back and libations provided by Wirtz Beverage.  Chef Akira Back has chosen to feature the Big Eye Tuna Pizza, Crispy Kalbi roll and his famous Baked Crab Hand Roll among other items.  Gulf Oyster Industry Counsel's amazing Oyster bar. Salty coastal waters produce the world's best oysters for the world's best chefs and restaurants, harvested today as they have been for generations.  Chef's menu will be paired with specialty reserved Sakes, Wines & Spirits provided by Wirtz Beverage and custom cocktails created by the mixologists from Hendrick's Gin and Tito's Vodka" as described on the website, the actual format of the event was a standing circus of confusion where "reserved" tables were fed full trays of food while the rest attempted to hunt down one of four circulating servers that were frequently mobbed and stripped clean at the doors where 'diners' gathered like a group of kids playing World of Warcraft sitting on a spawn spot.With booze of decent quality and the modicum of food equally competent a total of six mouthfuls of food plus three oysters were accrued by myself (one literally FROM a reserved table) during the course of the afternoon, probably justifying the $26 though certainly not $100 or the overall aggravation.  With no Akira in site and 'live music' that fell through for unknown reasons I can only assume that this 'event' was a money-grab intended to draw high rollers to The Bellagio or an attention-seeker for an outdated property hoping to generate new fans; both goals a miserable failure as we walked out in search of sustenance down the strip at Aria.Sexy place with stunning fountain views!Walking into this place everything is just sexy. The hostesses, the furniture, the lighting, the tulip on your table and then the stunning Bellagio fountains! Let's begin with the food items which are the whimsical sushi rolls. We ordered a baked crab roll which was very delicate yet filling and the popping spicy crab roll which happened to be the highlight of the evening. This roll had actual pop rocks in it and was so much fun to eat! Note to all sushi places, start using pop rocks! I loved the sweetness from it and it all came together so well.Next we had the Kobe beef flat iron which came with baby root vegetables & potato purée. On the side you receive warm teriyaki glaze and it was smooth & sweet. This dish was good but nothing special. Ordered a side of mushrooms that were great! We also had a few cocktails, one was the sunset that contained grey goose l'orange, blood orange purée and yuzu (nothing special) and then the Infusion which contained pineapple & vanilla infused "early bloom" sake and Bacardi light rum (loved this one) the drink presentations were beautiful with very feminine touches like an orchid and an orange twist.Everything here looks really good and service was on it. When we arrived the place was empty and as we left it was packed. Grab a seat near the windows for the views of the fountains! This part is the cherry on top of this experience.This was the last restaurant in the Bellagio that I had not been to and I decided to give it a go before seeing 'O' again.  I had a reservation for 5 PM to assure plenty of time to eat and relax before the 7 PM show.  I was taken to a two top at the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains.I looked at the menu and my server came and asked about water/other beverages and I ordered my standard iced tea which was quickly brought to the table.  I looked over the menu some more and the server gave me some recommendations.  I decided to order one cold shared plate and one warm shared plate as the server (and some reviews) point out that the shared plates aren't that large.I got the Big eye tuna pizza and the tempura Alaskan king crab.  These were two recommendations from the server and he pointed out that the tempura crab had been on the Best Thing I Ever Ate Food Network show.The tuna pizza was very good.  It had a very, very thin crust with just enough substance to pick up the pieces and eat it truly like a pizza.  The flavors were great even the truffle oil because it was used sparingly.  The tempura crab was a bit of a disappointment.  It was OK but the tempura was a bit heavy and took away from the crab. I couldn't help but think it was a waste of good crab making it tempura style.  It wouldn't go on my list of best thing I ever ate.For dessert, I ordered the Chocolate in a cup.  It consisted of Nutella, banana foam, and vanilla bean ice cream.  The Nutella is in the cup and there's a ring on top of the foam that breaks and dissolves into the foam and ice cream.  It was a great dessert.Service was impeccable.  The view of the fountains is always good.  During dinner, there were three fountain shows.  Prices are Strip prices but I knew this going in so it doesn't affect my rating.

Review Text :
The facts: My finest meal...  ever.My personality: I'm Chinese, being cheap is in my genes.Joel Robuchon at the Mansion was an eye-opening experience.  Never in my wildest dreams did I believe that paying $360 per person would ever be worth it (this is the standard price for the degustation menu), but eating here changed my mind (to tell the truth, you really don't have much of a choice at Robuchon.  Penny-pinchers can opt for the "cheaper" $225 per person menu, but that's about all you have in terms of choice).  Wifey and I walked in breathing fire.  We told each other that no place on god's green earth could ever be worth the money we were about to flush here.  All we wanted was the experience and a nice story to tell about how we were once young and crazy and blew a chunk o' money at Vegas.  Well, the cheap Chinese part of my persona now hates me.  I am very close to saying that Robuchon may actually be worth it.Joel Robuchon is probably one of the world's greatest living chefs.  He has more Michelin stars than he knows what to do with, and has been one of the biggest influences in the post-Nouvelle cuisine era.  The man was a living god even before he appeared on Japan's Iron Chef!Now don't mistake this place for L'atelier Joel Robuchon which is the more casual-themed restaurant nestled right next door at MGM... this place is the Mount Everest of fine dining.So why should you consider dropping a grand on one meal?Well lemme tells ya...Everything here is "over the top".  From the selection of 28 kinds of bread from the bread cart, to the impressively gaudy 30ft ceilings and purple themed dining room, and the requisite snooty French waiter.  Every plate was a work of art and the creativity was impressive.  What softened the pain I felt when I signed the outrageous credit card bill was the fact that they did everything possible to make this worth your hard-earned money.  They shaved truffle onto everything, stuffed foie gras into every nook and cranny, and topped whatever they could with caviar.  In fact, I almost believe that they would sprinkle truffles over the guests if they thought it would make your experience better.  I would recommend this place highly!!***** UPDATE  11/07*****No, I didn't go back (yet)... But I feel VINDICATED now that the world-famous Michelin Guide has reviewed Las Vegas and has determined that the ONLY establishment worthy of three stars is.... Joel Robuchon at the Mansion!As of this writing, the Michelin Guide has only reviewed 4 cities in the US: New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.  Only 6 restaurants amongst all of these cities were awarded 3-stars.  Los Angeles was the only city unable to produce a 3-star winner (confirming my suspicion that El Lay is a terrible food city).Let me get just one thing straight.I am willing to shell out for something good. For something pretty delicious. When I heard about the $360 price tag for a 13 course meal (yeah... that's right bitches. 13 courses - not 16 like I was expecting - and yeah - that pricetag is without wine), I'll admit that I balked. I was hesitant. But hey, if it makes my tastebuds sing - I'm all willing to give it a try.Let me tell you the context - my bf got a big pay raise so he really wanted to go there - hey! what's life if you don't splurge every once in a while.Anyway, we head over to the MGM and yeah, I was wowed. Wow'd by the beautiful chandelier, the plush cushions in the booth seats, the french linens.Nothing could really prepare me for such a big diappointment. First things first - they refuse to give you tap water. They say that they only serve bottled water and you have a choice - fizzy or non-fizzy. And this is at $10 a bottle. Not to mention the server practically jumps to refill your glass after you've taken only 1 sip. Just adding to the $360 tab.As I was contemplating going to the bathroom for a drink of water (from the sink!), they brought a nice palate cleanser - a berry granite  with a citrus foam which was served over dry ice to keep it perfectly cool. Unfortunately it went down hill from there.Basicially, after the next three dishes - tomato/coriander/caviar were a great disappointment. Okay the tomato was served with a tomato gelee. The coriander was served as a foam/gelee thing. Caviar three ways was some sort of gelee/foam thing.By this point, my bf and I was looking at each other thinking - does this guy do something other than fancy jello and foam? My boyfriend leaned over and whispered in my ear - "What's your favorite dish so far?" My answer: "the bread cart" (an impressive 16+ selection of brioche/baguettes). My bf basically agreed. Sad, isn't it?Okay, from there things get a little better. A really good egg ravioli - delicious. A decadent sea urchin flan, a delectable shrimp tea and a subpar lobster bonbon - comprised a shellfish dish. A decent turbot, an okay salmon - nothing too impressive. The Japanese Kobe Beef was pretty good but I've had better preparations of Kobe beef  before. A soybean risotto - fair but nothing to shout home about.There was an interesting margarita - frozen yogurt with effervescent sugar. A yummy herb sorbet (mint flavored primarily). Because it was my bf's b-day, they wheeled out a meringue/ice cream cake with raspberry sorbet. It was beautiful however they gave us only two slivers of the cake and then wheeled the rest away. We're still wondering what happened to the rest of the cake. Then came the mignardises - the impressive cart of petit fours that number at least over 30+ served with coffee or tea. (By the way, being Chinese - they had crappy white tea - just a few sprigs sprinkled in to give the water some color).A sad thing was I asked our server which one of the petit fours were her favorite - she mentioned she'd only tried one. Normally, if you are a server especially at a fancy restaurant like this, you have a good idea what your clientele is eating. Heck even in the lower end restaurants - the same thing. But here, obviously not so.So that's it - we got a lemon loaf on our way out for the next day, copies of the menu accompanied by a sense of feeling like we'd been ripped off. Yes, the presentation of the food was beautifully done and I was impressed. However unique presentation or innovation does not necessarily mean that it will taste very good.And the pricetag - given the ingredients that were used - is wholly not justified. Other than the caviar/Norweigan salmon (tasteless by the way)/kobe beef there wasn't any ingredient that was really expensive.Because of that, I'm giving Joel Robuchon a big two stars - one for the bread cart, one for the petit fours which were the highlight of the visit. Honestly - to truly enjoy maybe 6 of 13 courses and pay $900+ for two people - that's a little too much.Intro:I was floating on a cloud the entire time.Food:We had the six course tasting menu:Avocado pure in a thin herb gele and olive oil flavored curd cheese:  AMAZING.Shaved white truffles and potatoes with olive oil, topped with foie gras carpaccio:  AMAZING.Custard of Gorgonzola with a pear vierge and sage tomatoes:  Decent.Pan-fried sea bass with a lemon grass foam and stewed baby leeks:  AMAZINGGrilled Kobe beef with matsutake mushroom, parsley tempura, horseradish mustard:  AMAZING.  I have to admit, I was a little fearful of the idea of the mushroom and tempura with my Kobe, but it all complimented each other nicely.Pineapple with hazelnut-praline and orange Pekoe tea sorbet:  I didn't have a chance to try this.  At this point, I was feeling like a genuine fatty.Service:It was perfect, just the right amount of attention and knowledge without it being so overbearing.Ambiance:Exquisite.  Very clean and minimal.  Brought back memories of Paris.Overall:This is truly an experience.  It's worth every shiny penny.In the City of Sin, this place is HEAVEN!If you know that there's no way of you entering through the pearly gates of afterlife or if you'd just like to experience it now, you MUST go to Joel Robuchon at the Mansion.  True, the price tag is steep.  But, can you really put a price on the culinary apex.  (I use the word apex because it's all downhill from here.)From one dish to the next Chef Le Tohic just challenges your imagination and palette.  On June 1, 2008, his 16 course tasting menu took us on a mariner's voyage.On a final note, sixteen courses were tough.  Everything was a dream, it was all so good that I forgot to pace myself.  It nearly put me in a (food) coma, and that's when boyfriend started singing... girlfriend in a coma, i know, i know, it's serious.  (silly)Thank you Chef Le Tohic and your staff, especially Jan, our amazing table attendant.  You made my birthday a very memorable experience.==================================Our menu is as follows:  (Amanda B. took great pictures of the meal that night, see Photos)0. Bread - You have to see this.  It's a well presented bread tray, baked fresh daily with nearly twenty varieties.  And, they have them reheated after you choose so they arrive warm.1. L'AspergeBlanche - White Asparagus "Panna Cotta", fresh almonds and lemon grass. - This was simple, refreshing, and well presented dish.2. La Tomate - Salad of tomato, olive oil with basil, tomato gelee topped with mozzarella cheese. - This dish came in two parts, but meant to be consumed together.  The gelee looked like a plate of miniature eyes.  And, the staff shuck the gelee after they sit it down that it made me giggle seeing all those moving eyes looking at me.  But, back to the dish itself.  Wow!  The tomato was such a delight and the gelee made it a really fun dish.3, 4, 5. Le Caviar - thin couscous and Oscetra caviar, smooth cauliflower cream, delicate gelle of green asparagus. - This trio of caviar from Iran was heaven on earth.6. L'CEuf - Egg yolk in a baby spinach ravioli with morels. - When we cracked into to this ravioli, the quail yolk just oozed goodness.7. La Saint-Jacques - Scallops royal with chive emulsion and buckwheat tuile. - The tuile made this dish very playful.8. Les Crustaces - Truffle langoustine raviloli with chopped cabbage, sea urchin, potato puree with hint of coffee and ginger perfumed tea. - Jan highly recommended the langoustine in this trio.  According to him, it is the best dish he's ever had.  And, I have to say, the langoustine is pretty high up on my list too.9. Les Petits Pois - Light pea veloute with mint on top of delicate sweet onion custard. - Good dish, but, at this point, I began to slow down.  Lucky for me, my boyfriend loves a good pea veloute.10. Le Thon - smoked and seared tuna, cauliflower, nori and green curry. - Yummy yellowtail.11. Le Veau - Sautee veal chop with natural jus and vegetable tagliernis flavored with pesto. - The rosemary on the dish was very powerful to the nose.  But, set that aside, the veal was perfect.12. Les Pousses de Soja - Soy beans cooked risotto style with lemon zests and coriander. - The soy bean was presented to me in a way that I never had it before, and it was good.13. L'Acai - Red fruits franite, fresh raspberry and yogurt sorbet.  - This dish really woke me up.  Very refreshing, very good.14. Le Caramel - Caramel cremeux infused with Arabica, chocolate rice soufle.  - Oh, men!  Think of a multi-layered dessert where you have to take your spoon and dip it through all the layers, then in one quick swoop, pull it up and take the perfect bite of chocolate goodness.  As a chocoholic, it was very nice!15. Raspberry Ice Cream Cake - A full raspberry ice cream cake (that could serve 8 people and there were only two at the table) arrived at our table with a candle and everyone wished me a happy birthday, a very sweet touch.  We had this with our favorite teas, I blache and my boyfriend oolong.16 - Le Cafe ou le The - escorte de mignardishes - special tasting of varieties sweet desserts. - I could barely take a bite of the cake, let alone the sweets.  We had a great and the staff was amazing.  Thus, we entrusted Jan to put together a couple boxes of goodies, which was accompanied by two copies of the menu and another full 8" tall, 8" round fruit cake.My 50th review.  Yay.Had the 16 course tasting meal.  One of the best meals of my life.  I can see how the decor is kind of love it or hate it.  I loved it.Excellent service.  The GM came over and had a 15 minute conversation with us.  He then came back to take our order.  Very classy.  After the meal he gave us a very un-rushed kitchen tour.  Throughout the rest of the meal we received incredible service.  I didn't realize that this is the flagship restaurant in the U.S.  It's Robuchon's only fine dining restaurant in North America.  Other two are in Tokyo and Macao.  The Asian influence was apparent throughout the meal.First they bring out the bread cart.  She rattled off like 20 different types of bread then took a deep breath and pointed at the shelf below and rattled off another 6 or 7.  Wow.  Baking done in house.  We tried 9-10 different types of bread - everything great - my fav was the saffron brioche.  The plating of the dishes was beautiful and creative. Every plate was custom made to go with the dish.  The plates also go with the decor.  This was the most visually appealing dining experience I've ever had anywhere.The starter was Osetra caviar over three kinds of crab.  This was amazing but I'll take Keller's oysters and pearls over this.  The plating though was extremely creative - served in a tin on an engraved plaque.Next course was coriander soup with deep fried cilantro and a bruchetta.  I have a little bit of a problem with deconstructed dishes.  I think it's because I'm an idiot.  I never know what to eat first or what to dip in what.  The coriander soup was delicious but a little too plentiful to be just drinking it straight.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to put the fried ciliantro in there and then dip the bruchetta or what.  Still it was a lovely dish and a nice way to open up the palete.The next dish was one of my favs.  Perfectly cooked scallop in ginger/leek broth.  Next was the frog leg.  Wow.  Probably my fav course.  I wish I could take like a dozen of these things to go.  One of the best dishes I've had anywhere in my life.  Bursting with flavor and umami goodness.Next was another one of these deconstructed dishes.  One plate had cooked uni over spiced spinach.  I didn't like the uni.  I know uni is out of season right now, but I've had some excellent uni (cooked and raw) in the last couple of weeks.  Also part of this course was lemongrass roasted lobster - decent.  And finally, was a langostine ball in some curry tea.  That was awesome - bursting with flavor.  Reminded me of a shrimp ball you'd find in saimin - the best "shrimp ball" I've ever had.Next was like a pea puree poured into an onion foam.  I was skeptical when I saw this but wow - it was yum.  One of my fav courses.Next was sea bass which unfortunately was way overcooked and underseasoned.  This was perhaps the only blemish on the meal.Next was sliced foie gras in cabbage ravioli.  Excellent dish - although it is a different experience than eating seared foie gras that melts in your mouth.  Also the cabbage was a little chewy and difficult to cut and I kind of choked on it a little.Next was a deconstructed trio of Kobe beef.  First was ribeye stuffed with carrot and also on that plate was heart of palm stuffed with bone marrow.  NOTE:  EAT A PIECE OF THE RIBEYE AND ONE OF THE MARROW/PALMS IN ONE BITE - much more synergy than eating separately as the marrow explodes in your mouth and complements the meat.  Also was Kobe cheek over silky mashed potatoes.  Definitely best cow cheek I've had.  And finally was a covered bowl of stew that was uncovered by the server when you were ready to eat it.  Very creative and delicious.Finishing off the savory courses was some spring root vegetables over couscous served in a tangine (nice touch).  Probably best couscous  I've ever had.  Very fresh tasting green beans.The desert courses started with picturesque fruit soup served with flowers.  Then a desert tray with as many choices of ganaches, candies and chocolates as the bread cart.  And finally your choice of multiple types of yummy sorbet.  In spite of an off dish or two, everything else was so next-level that I can comfortably say this is one of the best meals I've eaten in my life and without a doubt the best restaurant in Vegas.  Worth every penny - actually for $500/man I say it's a steal.  I can't wait to go back.***500th Review***Wow, where to start? The evening began with an awesome ride in the famous gold limo and a short tour of the Mansion. A hot chick dressed in a kimono leads you through  the Mansion and into food fantasy land. Sadly food fantasy land is incredibly ugly - done up in shades of pale pink and purple with lace doilies everywhere. We ate here 2 weeks after Easter and there were Easter eggs everywhere. Pink, purple, easter eggs.EW.Take out the pastel Easter theme and this place is flawless ! We did 2 courses for $135 and I'd really say 1 course for $105 or 2 courses for $135 is the way to go! You do NOT need to order dessert. Trust me. I could go on all day about the bread. The 35 choices. The fact that they heat up your bread for you. The butter carved lovingly off of a huge loaf with salt sprinkled on top. For us carboholics, you've just reached nirvana. Be careful, however, there's still food coming!The amuse bouche is crab and caviar. Delicious and impeccable.Course 1: It's between here and Alex for the best sea scallops in town. If you're a scallop person, by all means don't miss these. The king crab salad was equally amazing.Course 2: So I made the mistake of getting the lobster. While it was great, my husband ordered the foie gras wrapped in guinea hen. This was the single best dish I've ever had in my life. It sounded blah, but WOW, life changing dish. Like close your eyes in ecstasy dish! So good in fact that for $40 my Dad and I ordered one to share in addition to our lobster. The only travesty is that dish is too small ! I could eat 3 of those , but then I'm a glutton. Dessert: So like I said, don't order one. They bring out this cart of magical delights that's included with your meal, each one more fabulous than the last . FOURTY choices of mini treats. Each one hand painted in metallic colors.. wow.. beautiful, tasty, there really were no duds here. Tahitian vanilla caramels, banana filled chocolates (with actual fresh bananas inside!), white chocolate dipped pineapple... We got 5 or so each, but we should have gotten 10 ! So I'm going to leave you with some help if you're trying to decide between this place and Alex (my other favorite place in Vegas). I liked Joel a little bit better because *limo*guinea hen (best dish of my life)*bread cart*dessert cart However, the rest of the diners in my party preferred Alex. I can definitely agree on an aesthetic standpoint - Alex is just a better dining environment.  I didn't have any of the best dishes of my life at Alex, HOWEVER, Alex overall was more food for the price and every single thing was fantastic. In simple terms, Joel's food ranged from 4 to 5 depending on the dish. At Alex, everything was a 4.5 . My husband summed it up this way: Next time we want a nice dinner, call Joel and see if they have the guinea hen/foie. If they do - go to Joel for the $105 menu and just get that, the bread, the amuse, and the dessert cart! Otherwise, Alex all the way. PS - posted lots of pics. I'm not a big picture person but this place was so jaw dropping I couldn't resist.Nothing here actually WOW'd me.Nothing I ate really made me think 'I HAVE to have this again'.This was like eating in a library. Everyone was quite, they/we were afraid to talk because it was so pretentious. The classical music featured such hits as: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wod-MudLNPA&feature=relatedListen to this song and you can imagine the setting. I was seated on a purple velvet couch with pillows. After fidgeting with the pillows to prop myself up right at the table, well I noticed a foot stool, "odd for such a fancy place" I thought, but I had walked quite a way in 4 inch heels, so I used it.  I later found out this apparently is for you purse. (awkward)First of all, the waiters seemed to hang on your every word, which was annoying. If I want to talk to my date, well i don't need anyone chiming in. I asked my date 'what do you think this means'? Referring to something on the menu, out of no where pops a waiter who answered just as he is about to answer. That's what i mean. The whole meal we had to whisper, we finally started texting each other. That's pretty bad.If I smiled the head waiter would come over and ask if I needed something. I would say 'no I'm fine'. Pretty soon I just kept smiling to drive him crazy, it worked. He kept stopping at every pass. He probably now thinks I had the hots for him.QUICK TIP: For those of you too embarrassed to ask: If you see a menu item that says (supp $40) after it, that means on top of the menu price they add $40 dollars to it for whatever reason, like the truffle cheese souffle. They said it was because of the amount and price of truffles used. The lamb, well I guess it was a baby lamb fed gold flakes and the milk of the gods .Anyway on to the food: The amuse bouche (aka "gift from the chef") was a tin on a plaque. It looked like a tin of caviar, but it had something creamy under it. It was interesting. I ate it to be polite, but it was nothing special. In fact it was rather flavorless and the texture was off putting. It looked pretty.Everything was plated beautifully.The crab salad was my favorite menu item and my second course. It was excellent and almost too pretty too eat. The flavors and texture combined were amazing.My dates cheese souffle was too rich for me. The date ate it and was "not impressed".  The expensive truffles really did not seem to add anything to the dish other than a presentation factor.The main course I picked was lobster. It was beautiful, but a little tough. I expected it to melt like butter in my mouth. It didn't, in fact it was hard to cut. The flavor was ok, nothing special.I tried my dates lamb, it was very good, it tasted like any other lamb I have had at a restaurant, which made me wonder again why the upgrade in cost.The best part about the meal to me, was the bread cart. OH My God! It was pure heaven! They really need to open up a bakery for these clouds from heaven. They had the flakiest, butteriest, most flavorful, wonderful assortment of goodies, well i almost filled up on bread. You can have as many "cart items" from any cart, as your heart desires, don't be afraid to say "one of everything" when a cart comes strolling by. After 2 trips of the cart i pretty much did. There was garlic rosemary twists, brioche, cheese breads, croissants, crostini, baguettes, almost every type of bread imaginable and the absolute BEST!The $20 martini or specialty drinks were delicious, worth $20 a pop? Not really. I did not taste or feel any alcohol. I think we should have gone for a nice bottle of wine.Our actual desserts that came with the menu, they were odd. A strange menagerie of ingredients that I still am not sure if they went together well. I did not finish mine.The dessert cart was pretty, none of the candies/treats were anything special. Coffee and water are extra$.After the meal here ( $680 for 2), I wondered if rich people eat like this all the time, and if so, well I am glad I am not that rich or stuffy. I am, however, a food connoisseur. Someone who has always dreamed of eating at a 3 Michelin star rated restaurant, someone who would really appreciate the whole experience. I was somewhat disappointed, but I was truly happy for the experience.Note: I talk about price a lot, but in actuality, $$ is no object for me. So it is more FYI for middle income, average diners visiting for special occasions.I just got back from dinner with my wife a couple of hours ago and I could not wait to review it. I'm not a 'foodie.' I can appreciate fine dining as much as the next guy, but I'm equally, if not more so at home eating late night Jack in the Box. It was my wife who insisted on us coming here to celebrate her birthday, because she wanted to enjoy a dining 'experience.'Let me be clear about this: anyone who has actually eaten here and gives this place anything less than a full five stars is out of their freaking mind. Joel Robuchon is not just an amazing restaurant, it is literally the greatest culinary experience I have ever had in my life. And I have eaten at a number of fine establishments. And it's not even a close call.At the time I made the reservations, I mentioned a severe nut allergy. More on that later. We are staying at Vdara and they sent a limo to pick us up. Tres chic. It makes one feel like they aren't just having dinner, but rather that they are now experiencing an event.We drive through the back side of the MGM, to the Mansion, where our limo driver, A.J., drops us off and escorts us to the door. There we meet  Susie (who initially took my reservation), who greets us on cue and escorts us through the door, through a stunning courtyard, then through the mansion and finally out onto the casino floor and into the restaurant. From there, she guides us to our table. From start to finish, we never had to stop, it was one continuous motion from limo exit to being seated at our table. If you've ever seen "Goodfellas," there's a scene where Ray Liotta is introducing Debra Winger to life as his gf. The camera follows them through a back door, through a kitchen, and finally to a private table in front of a show at a club. We see the wonder on her face at what an amazing experience she's digesting. THAT is what you feel like. So effortlessly VIP it makes you question why you ever thought that you'd experienced VIP service before in your life.A host of staff are at your service. A somolier, your server, a manager...at every step of the way, the server reminded me that he remembered our food allergies and gave warnings about specific dishes, or in the case of the desert cart, only brought out those desserts which we could eat.I started with the mint pea cream soup, which was stellar, and my wife had the king crab app which was just beyond. Server comes by and asks if we want bread. Sure, why not? OMG, the guy's bringing out a tray with like 15 different types of bread and telling me about each one! Sweet. I love friendly, knowledgeable servers. Main courses were the foie gras for her and the salmon for me. Unreal as to both. For dessert, they surprised us with a birthday cake for my wife and then an assortment tray. Bill comes...'hey, you're staying at Vdara, right? Would you like to just charge that to your room?" Are you kidding me?? We're eating at a restaurant in the MGM Grand and you're offering me the option of charging my dinner to my room at Vdara?? Would I like to do that? Sure, I would, thanks for asking Romiro! And thank you for the gift bag that every diner gets when they leave.And finally, Susie with the escort back to our waiting limo and then the ride back to our suite. Oh, did I forget that the chef even came out and thanked us for coming? And not like pretentious annoying chef, I mean like really friendly thank-you-so-much-for-eating-at-our-restaurant exuberant chef. He even posed for a pic, which might have been tacky on our part to ask him to do, but whatever, he was game and we wanted something to remember the experience by.Now, let's be honest with ourselves for a moment. Our dinner ran a combined $450 when you add in the wine, the tips, the food, etc. That's not a cheap dinner, even if it does unfold over a leisurely 2 1/2 hours. And with a different wine selection, or an upgrade to the 16 course meal that they offer, a dinner for two here could easily run upwards of $1,000. But, if your budget allows for such an extravagance, you will be hard pressed to ever have a better dining experience in your entire life. And I guess that's not a bad price to pay for such a memory.Three star michelin in North America is rare. French Laundry, Joel Robuchon and few spots NYC....that's about it. Expectations are high and Joel's outpost in Vegas doesn't disappoint. The recession has certainly had its effect here as I doubt many can dine on 16 courses at $385 anymore without the expense account. They now offer a variation of smaller 2-6 course menus. Simpler and perhaps with more reason. So how does this compare in the world of French Laundry, Per Se, Alain Ducasse, El Bulli? Pretty well.We were staying at the MGM so the gold limo and private entrance we'll have to assume are pretty sweet. The quaint, regal homely dining room is impressive and the purple banquet seating is perfect for letting the food settle in. But the ultimate key is the food.Highlights -Bread cart - amazing selection, sample at least 3-4 pieces, the sweet rolls were buttery goodnessTruffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage (Suppl. $30) - amazing pocket of bursting flavour, well worth the suppl and the best appDuck and seared foie gras with cherries and fresh almonds - my love affair with foie continues with this amazing preparationSpring lamb skewer with sweet spices, vegetables with lemon confit (Suppl. $25) - easily the best main, so tender and not a hint of gameyness.Moka - The (i.e. French candy/chocolate cart) - This sweets cart just amazes. Like Charlie in the Chocolate Factory in French, I couldn't resist the hazelnut chocolates and truffles.So, it is expensive and it is a dining experience worth the price. The food was top notch, the service was impeccable and the bread/sweet carts are an offering unique onto itself. I'll be back once the credit markets free up again.My dining experience at Joël Robuchon started with a ride in a gaudy-ass gold-colored limo with leather top.  No joke.  The limo was right on time (as opposed to being five minutes late like us), picked the four of us up in front of our hotel and whisked us to The Mansion, a part of MGM that perhaps 98% of Vegas visitors have never seen, heard, or set foot on (present company included). So we were taken to this gated entrance, cobblestoned driveway (which was not exactly fun to navigate in 5" red soles) and lush indoor garden surrounded by balconies from the 29 plush suites (which apparently requires a line of credit of $300,000 to qualify to stay).  Then we were ushered by our hostess through the corridors flanked by high roller tables and $25 slot machines, directly to the heavy doors of Joël Robuchon.Behind the heavy doors was a small yet whimsical space dominated by purple and black velvet - opulent almost to the point of gaudy (but not quite!) - and  filled with hushed conversations of other dinner patrons.  Then it turned into a French lesson.  The hub, fortunately, is fluent in French (or should I say Canadian French), having born and raised in ON so it was somewhat interesting hearing him converse in French with the server and maitre'd.  Thankfully, the menu contains English translation and the server does speak English with a lilting French accent, so it didn't end up being too embarrassing for the rest of the group.We unfortunately did not have enough time for the $350 / 16-course menu so we settled for the five-course a la carte menu of l'amuse bouche - a serving of delicious, delicate black caviar which I could've had three of; appetizer (the French, just like the rest of the world outside of America, calls this part of the meal entrée.  For the Americans who do not believe me - I kindly refer you to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrée); soup; main course; dessert; and finally moka and thé (coffee and tea) with petit fours. As soon as we ordered, we were approached by a smiling server pushing a bread cart filled with what could've been twenty different kinds of petite carbohydrate goodness.  Between the four of us, we had saffron focaccia, basil focaccia, bacon-filled bread (which we verified is not French, but rather a genius creation of the chef), and lots and lots of traditional French petit pain.  The rest of the meal was a revelation that we were oohing and aahing throughout.  My appetizer consists of king crab with cauliflower cream and seasonal vegetable - an unlikely combination that turned out to be delicious and refreshing.  For soup, I had the light, frothy and fluffy chestnut cream with foie gras, bacon bits, and lardons foam.  Then I had the braised veal cheek with galangal-and-ginger-infused Thai broth, vegetable couscous and brocolli as the main meal and finally a banana creme caramel with yuzu ice-cream, whose tanginess went really well with the crunchy sweet honeycomb candy.  We sat back, sated and content while waiting for our server to bring out the coffee and tea.  Ordinarily I would've chosen a pot of green tea to cap off the meal, however the experience was anything but ordinary so I settled for a strong, black French press coffee, hold the cream and sugar.  The bitterness of the coffee complemented the petit fours that we had a lot of trouble selecting from the 45 available on the cart.  My absolute favorite was the blueberry opera cake and eclair, although the strawberry cheesecake dipped in white chocolate was pretty darn good as well.  As we were paying, the same hostess who greeted us at The Mansion came right by, advised us that the limo is ready, and off we went to our next stop: XS.My first Michelin 3 Star Restaurant starring the Chef of the Century. Well, not exactly, since we didn't get to meet Mr. Robuchon. However,The experience was amazing even sans Robuchon. And that's exactly what it is - an experience. Like going to the theater or opera. It's not just *eating.* Be prepared to spend some serious cash, but if you are considering dining here, you probably already knew that.First off, the restaurant is beautiful. I love the color combination of silver, purple, and black so I felt wrapped in shimmery goodness. Behind my shoulder to the right was Chuck Norris, and to my left was Nic Cage, so I was also in good company.They offer 5 menu options for you to select your own dishes. Each person at the table can have a different tasting menu which was a nice surprise, as most restaurants don't allow that. The first menu option starts at $109 and the 16 course degustation is close to $400. I went with a menu option that inlcluded an amuse bouche, a soup, an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. As with all of the tasting options, you also get to select from the amazing bread cart at the beginning of the experience, as well as from the decadent mignardises cart at the end.To recap our 3 hour experience: The bread cart:If bread can be described as beautiful, this cart certainly was. I had bacon bread, basil brioche and saffron brioche.Amuse bouche:Caviar on top of a crab and lobster salad. This was excellent and a perfect contrast of salty and sweet. My favorite part was when our waiter said something like: "Mr. Robuchon requests that you dip your spoon to the bottom of the dish to taste the full flavor combination."Appetizer:Salmon tartare topped with caviar. Very good, but probably the least memorable of all of my dishes.Soup:Chestnut and foie gras with bacon and celery foam. Ah, those little pieces of foie gras were scrumptious. Entree:Turbot and octopus with a lemongrass emulsion and baby leeks. Perfectly executed. Dessert:A whimsical combination of creme brulee, hazelnut pop rocks candies, chocolate marshmallow, and ice cream. The plate was decorated with metallic purple paper and purple sparkles. Love.The mignardises cart:So glittery and pretty. I sampled a blueberry opera cake, strawberry white chocolate cheesecake, limoncelo macaroon, caramel with chocolate, and raspberry chocolate cake. Served with Brazillian french press coffee. In lieu of dessert:My husband opted to choose from the very impressive cheese cart. Wow. As with the bread and pastry carts, you can basically select an unlimited amount of cheese. Unable to resist, I snuck a few pieces of his cheese. If you are so-so on desserts, definitely go this route. Other random musings:If you are staying at the MGM and sign up for the Prima VIP upon check-in deal, you get a free bottle of champagne with your meal! When you make your reservation, just mention Prima.There's also a free limo service that will bring you to the restaurant. We didn't partake since we were staying at the MGM.  I regret that since they drive you by the luxurious Mansion at the MGM, which most people don't know exists. It runs $5-15k/night. In conclusion:If you win big in Vegas and appreciate an excellent culinary experience, definitely come here to celebrate. But please don't don your Flamingo attire - jackets and cocktail dresses are a must.Joel Robuchon is the "chef of the century".  This place has three michelin stars, 4.5 stars on yelp, and recommended by foodies.  So naturally, after dining at a handful of michelin restaurants, we had high expectations for Joel Robuchon.  For chris sakes, Rod Stewart was sitting at the table behind us!!!  Furthermore, Joel Robuchon was in Vegas that night, and seeing him added a little extra touch.  After doing extensive research, my boyfriend and I opted for the two courses.  Here's our story:The Pros:- Bread cart was AMAZING!!!- Dessert cart was awesome!- Amuse-bouche was yummy caviar- The limo ride was very much appreciatedThe Cons:The Food.  Aside from the above, everything was disappointing.  - Le Canard: duck was passing at best.  The foie gras on the side was overcooked. We love foie gras, but had to force it down...foie gras should not be that way.- The King Crab wasn't even memorable.  I was disappointed after a taste.  It wasn't bad, just nothing special.- La Châtaigne soup was very bacon in flavor.  I can honestly compare it to bacon cooked on a stove top, and thrown into cream sauce.  The foie gras in the soup was overcooked as well.  I wouldn't even know it was foie gras unless I read the menu. - Le Veau: veal was passing.  It wasn't something I tasted and felt "wow, I must have this again".  After we finished our "experience" we felt disappointed with the food, and mentioned that it is not worth three michelin stars.  In addition, I started to feel queasy.  I thought it was the food's richness, however, if only that were it.  I spent the whole night amidst a toilet, throwing up.   I had one glass of wine, so it was not alcohol related.  Drunkedness and heart burn over food poisoning any day.  FAIL!In my honest opinion, Joel Robuchon in Vegas is living off of its hype.  It's either politics that gave him the stars, or what it used to be.  But the quality is sub-par, so save your money, do not dine here.  So overall:Joel Robuchon's Food - BADFood Poisoning - VERY VERY VERY BAD!!!!Michelin Stars #20, 21, and 22Let me start by answering your questions;"No" and "No."For my 30th birthday present, my wife treated me (us) to our first 3 star dining experience. My hopes were sky-high as we rode in our complimentary limo ride into the back of the MGM. We were escorted through the private baller area of the casino to the main entrance of the restaurant. Once inside, we were greeted with what might happen if you filled Barney the Dinosaur with gold and velvet and then blew him up, a purple pantheon of out-of-placeness. Of course, when having a once in a lifetime meal, you never order a la carte, you go all out with the 16 course degustation menu. Which leads me to some of my major gripes of the meal; the amuse was counted as a course, there were no intermezzos, apéritifs and digestifs to break up the heavy French food, and the amazing cheese cart was not part of the tasting!I lack the energy to describe each course in detail as I often do, but most of it was really really good. A couple were jaw droppingly good, yet others were only okay, and only okay for any place. For the price and the reputation, I expected so much more. I expected the foie gras to shed new light on the start of the universe and for the veloute to show me god, but no epiphanies were had that night. Service was spot on, never smothering or pretentious, and the wine guy guided us well. The pre-dinner bread and separate butter carts were equally amazing. For the money though, we both agreed that we would choose Urasawa, Spago, or Providence in a heartbeat for another meal. So now for your questions;Was it worth it? NOWould we go back? NOPS - No good pictures because my old cybershot took a shit that day, so I bought a Sony Nex-3 and had no idea how to use it for dinner =[Joel Robuchon could not possibly have done more in the way of service and presentation.  To give you an idea of what I mean:  a couple next to us ordered tea.  The wait staff brought a cart by with a variety of live potted tea plants.  While wearing white gloves, they cut the individual tea leaves off to put in a cup of warm/hot water, which was heated by a small candle.While walking to the restaurant, I was a little skeptical that the ambiance would live up to its reputation.  Located in the middle of MGM Grand, you pass slot machines in a smoke filled casino when walking to the entrance.  However, once inside, you are transported to the serene, rich, and romantic world of Joel Robuchon.Plush purple seats, amazing artwork, beautiful floral arrangements, and a stunning chandler in the center of the room.  The bathrooms, while chic, were actually a little difficult to use.  Everything was black.  The floors, the toilet, the sink, the linens--everything black.  Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but the lighting in the bathroom is pretty low, making it seem like you're taking a pee and washing your hands in outer space.The food was exquisitely presented and flawlessly executed.  There was never a hint of sloppiness or unsteady hand.  This was a masterful representation of culinary precision.HOWEVER...*************Ultimately, for a 3 Michelin star restaurant and a $600+ bill for two, I expect the absolute best dining experience of my life.  Everything here was the best I've ever experienced--except for the food.  There was not a single dish that I will remember.  All of the dishes tasted good, but none were exceptional in my mind.  This is the sole reason I gave four out of five stars.I may not have eaten at other 3 Michelin star restaurants, but I have eaten at other 5-star AAA restaurants and James Beard Award-winners' restaurants.  It was there that I experienced the sensation of my jaw dropping and my mouth watering long after eating--not at Joel Robuchon.*************I still implore you to come here if you want to experience the best service, presentation, and ambiance a restaurant can offer.I thought my review was starting to run long, so here is a quick summary of the individual food dishes I tried:For our anniversary, we got the 4-course menu selection.Caviar L'Amuse-bouche: presented in a round metal tin, which was both cool and tacky.  It felt a little like I was being served a can of sardines.  It tasted good enough, but I still don't see what the big deal about caviar is.Truffled langoustine ravioli: the umami flavor from the truffles floods your palette, but then leaves a sweet lobster finish. Foie gras with artichoke: pretty and well balanced.  Chestnut soup: Tasted like a bacon latte.Pan fried sea bass and octopus with lemon grass-way too much lemon flavor.  I couldn't taste anything else.Beef ribeye, wasabi spinach: perfectly cooked and tender.  Fuji apple confit, cinnamon sable and Manzana milkshake: I probably would've preferred a brownie and ice cream over this dish.Guanaja chocolate with coffee ice cream, caramelized puffed rice and lemon confit: ice cream and chocolate were yummy, but the lemon confit took over the whole dish.They offer dozens of different breads.  Butter from France, olive oil from Spain.To finish the meal, they offer 60 or so different varieties of little chocolates.  My favorite was the French Mystery.  Imagine the tiniest possible little bite size éclair.  And then, imagine it has a little baby, and that baby sits on top of its mommy.  Now you're picturing the French Mystery.To celebrate our anniversary, the restaurant surprised us with a sorbet and coconut cake with orange sauce.continue from the original review... ******* like any true french restaurant (and italian), the moka was served to complete a meal. a miniature french pressed coffee for me (cappuccino and espresso are other options) and a pot of white chinese herbal tea for the hubby, accompanied by a complimentary surprise birthday cake, were presented to us. the coffee was quite delicious and strong but never with that bitter after taste. by then we were full, but this cake was phenomenal, the BEST THING I EVER ATE! this white cake was layered with fresh cream, passion fruit filling, mango sauce and meringue. i don't eat mango and i am partial to the sweetness of meringue, but the moment this cake touched my mouth, i knew i could die happily. there are some notable things to elaborate in this review; the much talked about carts. there are 4 different carts being wheeled around throughout the dinner. all servers memorized each and every item on all 4 carts (that's like over 200 names)...quite a challenging task. the first was the bread cart which seriously had more variety than any bakery i've visited. once we selected our choices, the waiter warmed them up before bringing them to our table. they were very generous with the bread and we enjoyed a few different types, but our favorites were the bacon epi baguette and cheese brioche. also, the french butter and olive oil were nothing like we had before, even in europe. the mignardise cart which was stationed in front of the entrance ever beautifully was presented to us. we let the waiter use his magic and knowledge to pick the best for us. unfortunately, we could not consume more than 1 out of 10 pieces after that BEST EVER cake. our waiter kindly packaged these tiny, bite-sized desserts to take home along with two boxes of citrus and berry marshmallows (i can tell you that these are not your every day marshmallows!) and a colorful booklet showcasing joel robuchon las vegas. the cheese cart which we did not partake in, looked quite impressive. i could smelled the pungent cheese a mile away. they were paired with nuts and pieces of fruits. the last was a cart designated for tea. not only did this house a variety of dry tea leaves, it had live potted tea plants, from lemon grass to mint. all i could say was "omg...unbelievable...omg!" the waiter would cut the leaves of your choice, wearing white gloves, and serve the tea in a pot, heated and stayed warm by a candle. another food item we were impressed by was the mashed potato which was served with our main course. this was pure butter (i don't want to know how much of butter was used here), and we could've had a bucket of this and more. one last thing that made our experience at joel robuchon more memorable and unforgettable was the people who were dining around us. a table of chinese family in flannel shirt, fishing vest and white shocks (this is 100% true although i would not recommend this attire), paying everything in cash, a table of two jewish businessmen in fine italian suits sharing their experiences at pierre gagnaire and alain ducasse in paris, taking pictures of every dish for their wives, a table of a lone lady with french accent gormandizing the degustation menu ever graciously, a table of persians with their colorful ties, talking and laughing about how much they were down (i admire their good nature even when they lost so much), and a table of older couple congratulating our celebration of birthdays, envying the BEST EVER cake.  who's counting the michelin stars and aaa five diamonds?  this was a place that never tried to display an air of snobbishness you often face in other restaurants of this caliber. everyone talked to each other no matter where you came from. at the end of the meal, we were escorted back to the mansion where a silver limo was waiting to take us back. the driver asked, "did you take a picture with mr. robuchon?" WHAT? the man was there? i guess it never hurts to ask. we found out the chef of the century usually shows up for long weekends when vegas gets busy. i cannot wait to take this journey again. we cherished every minute of our dining experience here. we were treated more like friends surrounds by people who enjoy lives as much as we do. when you are here, take a look around the restaurant. amidst the ritzy extravagance, you'll see and appreciate the personal touches of joel robuchon everywhere.I glanced over all these rave reviews and I'm sorry I get lazy to go into detail bc it seems so redundant!  So, here's another gushing review of this place, I'll try and keep it short!Came here for a lovely Valentine's dinner and..It's awesome. So far, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  Love the dark decor with purple furnishings, dazzling chandeliers, glod accents, and plush cushions.  Their service was on point.  The plating was beautiful and flowed nicely.  The only thing I didn't enjoy were their fake candles.  I guess they got sick of scraping wax off the tables?My favorite is the bread cart--I'm a carb girl.  I could sit there and eat bread all day and be satisfied.  We had the 4-course dinner and we were beyond full by the time we got to dessert.  I'm not sure how people eat the 6 course or even the 16 course tastings.  I guess you'd have to skip out on the bread.The foie gras was my favorite, as usual.  It literally melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting MORE. The second favorite was the dessert cart with coffee.  I love picking and choosing and then picking more! Just like the bread cart my eyes get big and I get greedy! Can't wait to come here again so I can try the 16 course tasting.  Gotta save something for next time, right?I told Gage that words could not describe it.  He asked me to do an interpretive dance.  I'll spare you.  But it was magical.It's worth it.  It's a dining experience of a lifetime.  A dinner for 2 was more than my rent.  Way more.  Still worth it.  The bread cart is delicious.  They have bacon bread.  Score.  The cheese cart is amazing.  I tried everything.  Everything.  The little candy cart blew my mind.  And everything before and after surpassed all of my expectations.  I will say this though.  I enjoyed the regular menu items MORE than those with the supplemental price.  And what's this?  A parting gift...for me?  Why, thank you.  They gave us a pistachio cherry pound cake for the road.  It was wrapped in purple cellophane, in a pretty black bag that marked the name of the restaurant.  That pound cake accompanied me to the Hard Rock for Gambling.  To a Strip Club.  To a night club.  More Gambling.  Made it through 4 cab rides.  And finally, back home to share with my culinary classmates.  Just don't tell them the pound cake was inside Hustler.My husband and I went to Las Vegas for a quick honeymoon after our wedding since we both had to go back to work. He booked Joel Robuchon after research and reading about how amazing this place is.  Our trip to Joel Robuchon started out wonderful. A limo picked us up from our hotel and we got a walk through the gorgeous MGM mansion. The decor of the restaurant was beautiful. Then the wine list came and my husband LOVES wine so he asked to speak to the sommelier with a few questions about the wine. The sommelier arrived at our table and rather hesitatingly answered my husband's few questions then proceeded to steer us towards another page with the comment "I think you'll find these more in your.. price range"record scratch.uhm, excuse me?! Yes, we are both in our mid twenties and it doesn't help that we are asian and therefore look like we are in our teens but here we are, about to shell out at least $600 for a meal (ours ended up around $800) that comment was so unnecessary in so many ways. We were both shocked into silence and proceeded with our meal.Then came time for dessert. During the course of our meal we saw the tables to our right, left, front, and back be served complimentary desserts/cakes for anniversaries, birthdays, etc. We ended up with nothing despite the fact that it was our honeymoon. I'm not one to complain about complimentary things but it was a little ridiculous considering literally everyone in the restaurant was getting them except us. Perhaps we were not in the.. price range..Overall the food itself was really really spectacular. The bread and dessert cart was amazing and every dish that came along was just exquisite. However the service completely ruined our meal and it was really really disappointing. We've never dealt with such condescension at any restaurant and was definitely not expecting it from such a highly renowned place with a michelin star.When I was asked to dine at a AAA Five Diamond, Forbes Five Star, Three Michelin Star, Wine Spectator Grand Award and Chef of the Century's restaurant, the question wasn't IF...It was WHEN!My last night in Vegas marked the unforgettable occasion and as soon as I opened those shiny glass paned double doors, I knew I was in for a treat!  As I walked across the foyer into the main dining room,  I left the hustle and bustle of the frenzied casino behind me and I was instantly transported into a luxurious 1930's style French bistro with a huge crystal chandelier cascading above me. Honestly, this place was dripping with opulence!Truth be told, I do get a bit uncomfortable in fancy schmancy restaurants.  Perhaps it's the well pressed white table cloths or the half dozen stuffy staff serving my every whim, but this place was not like that at all.  The servers were warm, friendly and present without being overbearing, which was really nice!  Add to that the elegant yet inviting atmosphere and I was feeling like a king! A hungry one at that!     As soon as we were seated and handed our nicely bound menus, I instantly knew in my mind that I wanted to try the 16 course tasting menu.  Heck, you only live once, right? Because we were in a festive mood, we decided on a bottle of bubbly and for me, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot fit the bill perfectly!Then came the famous bread cart in all its glory! Wow! It was a sight to see! There were more than a dozen breads to choose from to start the meal and i think we tried almost all of em!  Three magnificent breads, however, stood out from the pack.  Those being the buttery cheese brioche, savory bacon epi, and chewy cheese baguette.  Then, of course, came the food! Honestly, it was so beautifully plated there were times I simply felt it was a shame to eat it! But I got over that hurdle fairly quickly. Now, I don't plan on boring you with the entire 16 course blow by blow, but I will focus on the dining highlights which made the evening extra special for me!Amuse Bouche "sangria emulsion" refreshingly light citrusy blood orange cream emulsion above a chilled jam in a whimsical dry ice bowl with small chunks of apples and berry sangria gelee.  Lip smacking tartness with a delightfully smooth & creamy finish! Excellent way to awaken the palate!  Trio of Caviar Caviar with Asparagus - Although not the most interesting pairing of the evening, the flavors of the fresh green asparagus and salty caviar played well against each other. Salmon Tartare with Shiso Sprouts and Caviar - The textures were delicate and the flavors were refined.  Daikon Cous Cous with Caviar - The thin delicate slivers of cool daikon wrapped around fluffy cous cous and topped with caviar was an exhilarating finish to an interesting play on Japanese cuisine.       Lobster - Topped with fragrant black truffle, the langoustine ravioli was magnificent! The grilled lobster was simple yet beautifully presented. Subtle flavors but hey it's lobster! Sometimes a good thing shouldn't be messed with! The smooth & creamy sea urchin fennel potato puree was inspiring and texturally inviting, as well.Chestnut Soup over Foie Gras Foam - Rich frothy and flavorful with savory bacon bits. The chunks of roasted chestnuts added a subtle sweetness to this warm and rustic soup. Bone marrow - One of my personal favorites! The marrow was luscious, rich and supple in texture. It also exhibited the most irresistible aroma! The popcorn added a pleasant textural dimension to this delightful dish.Sea bass - Beautifully seared, this magnificent piece of fish came bathing in an irresistible butter sauce. The artichoke balanced the flavor profiles nicely. Birthday Cake - As the evening came to a close, the staff came out with a cart embellished with lavish decorative baubles and a small sign that read "Happy Birthday" The accompanying birthday cake was extraordinary! Perched on a large black pedestal, it was absolutely majestic but all I could think of was digging into it!  To my surprise, it was a mango meringue ice cream cake and although we couldn't take it home with us, we did indulge in two large decadent slices and it was fantastic! Bravo to the dessert chef!If that wasn't enough we were given free reign of the mignardises (dessert cart) that had a vast selection of petit fors, small cookies and yes...macarons!They boxed up the cookies and gave us an additional box of marshmallow treats to take home with a copy of the menu and a nicely bound colored brochure documenting the magical evening.I'd have to say this was by far the most amazing dining experienceof my life.  Would i do it again? Someday. But for now, I'll just revel in the fine memories of an unforgettable evening that will leave my palate in infinite bliss!Happy "Birthday" Eats, Part Deux!!A French chef once told me "French people are born with two gifts, making love and making food. "  While I sadly cannot speak to the prior, the latter is exemplified by Joel Robuchon.The short review:  THE BEST!The long review (sorry its so long):Three Michelin stars and the AAA Five Diamond award speak for themselves.A meal at Joel Robuchon showcases the French passion for food, respect for ingredients, deftly practiced restraint, and the melding of cutting edge cooking techniques with the traditional.  The presentation is nothing short of breath taking yet everything on the plate has a purpose.  Ahhh like a beautiful yet sensible woman.While the core of each dish may be the same, portion size and the way they are dressed varies depending on what menu you order them from (a la carte, pre fixe, or degustation).  Keep this in mind when trying to follow the recommendations of another.  The current menu standout is the signature truffle langoustine ravioli.  A see through thin wrapping envelopes a core of sweet, moist , langoustine tails dressed by an incredible foam (not your typical brown butter sauce), and doused in a generous amount of shaved black truffles.  Sensuality on a plate.The current 16 course ultimate degustation menu was nothing short of perfection.  Course after course of pure artistry and intriguing flavors.  How about a salad of haricot verts (green beans) with Parmesan and foie. So simple.  So delicious as the richness of the foie and the earthiness of the parm makes the vegetal flavors of the beans explode.  Too simple, how about the langoustine ravioli described earlier with grilled spiny lobster lightly accented by a curry served aside an aspic of uni with a fennel potato puree scented with anise.  The warmth of the ravioli and puree quickly soften the aspic releasing the creamy goodness of the uni throughout the dish.  Layer after layer of flavor.  Truly orgasmic.The ambiance is contemporary European elegance.  Stunning. The price?  Prefix menus (2, 4, 6 courses); $120 - $240.  The ultimate degustation menu (16 courses) $425 in the fall of 2011. If it sounds crazy, consider there must be more chefs in the kitchen than guest in the dining room preparing your meal.The outstanding wine list focuses on France.  Good vintage depth. Fair pricing considering the cellaring, however the average bottle price is $300.  There are few worthy selections below $100.Service is perfect.  It is executed by professionals who view service as a career.  Practiced, polished,  extremely knowledgeable of menu and culinary techniques  They are experts at making you feel like a welcome guest.  No stuffiness. Finally, remember there are things even your casino host cannot do:  provide illicit drugs, arrange "companionship" for the evening, and get a same day reservation at Joel Robuchon.  Make you reservations well in advance.Ahhh, the French really do have it right.My analysis of the myriad of glowing five star reviews:A.) This place is the default "most expensive food in Vegas" so I think it attracts people who aren't accomplished in much other then spending cash.B.) When you drop 500-1200 a person on dinner it is really hard to admit that the food and experience is less the five stars.I have enjoyed opportunities to dine at some really swanky places with prices that do command a healthy cash flow.  Joel Robuchon was by far the most overrated, unimpressive, and exorbitantly expensive meal I have ever indulged.  I guarantee if you are dropping the cash on this experience your are likely not staying at the MGM where the restaurant is located.  The MGM Grand?  Come on folks....  The place is like a goddamn amusement park and holds ranks and class with the likes of the fabulous Luxor and New York New York.  So they pick you up at your far more modern and luxurious hotel in a funky ass, old, skankafied beige limo that says "MGM Grand on the side."  Right on!  Like everyone gushes, you are rolled up to some ally entrance in the back of the hotel and are ushered in to an impressive hotel that you will NOT be staying at anytime soon.  Personally, if I was dropping 5K a night to stay at this private hotel, I would be pissed off that they shuttle some two bit strip dwellers through my private space so they can ooh and ahh while strutting through.  The whole entrance thing is complete theater, at the end of your tour you are dumped out into the reality of the MGM's casino floor area.  The hotel is old, and dumpy.  The restaurant design is classic stuffy french with a large helping of schizophrenic circus flare.  Don't be put off if the hostess, captain, and most all the wait staff put on a strange stuffiness that is not warm, nor is it directly dismissive.  It is the perfect balance of cocky that makes most general, submissive diners feel they have been blessed with the opportunity to dine.  The bread cart is a complete exhibition and a method to fill patrons up on inexpensive bread.  You won't find warm, fresh bread.  Just a bunch of gimmicky ass, stale, cold pieces of herb, cheese, and bacon bread.I ordered the full tasting menu.  In asking my options with the Sommelier, I was offered the option of three tasting costs.  Never have I been offered the option to choose my wine pairing based on cost levels.  To top it off, the price levels were some bullshit like $299, $599, or $999.  Let's just say, 300, 600, or 1000 for christ sake.I went with the most "modestly priced" wine pairing and I was blown away with the swill they poured me. The food was interesting, it was prepared well, some items were delicious however most of the 16 were just uninspired combinations of expensive ingredients.  An example was a piece of cold asparagus, cut down the middle stuffed with beluga..  Yay!  Most dishes that should have come out hot or at least warm, came out cold.  Pretty, but cold. Dessert was ridiculously long winded, as they felt the need to review two dozen little candies on yet another cart.  My share was $900.00 and I left with a huge chip on my shoulder.  Never again.I had very high expectations going in, and I was not disappointed.I've eaten at a lot of amazing places, I was raised foodie, and very little intimidates me.  But I will have to say, I was kind of on the defensive when I came here.First of all, it was a little awkward as I was dining solo.  My dinner companion had bailed on me, so I was going in on my own.  Additionally, I didn't make a reservation and just sauntered in.  Glad I had an extra sportcoat with me.  The ambiance was amazing, beautiful, exactly what I expected.  The two hostesses were tall, gorgeous women in couture dresses.  As I was mustering up courage to enter, I pulled the two huge front doors way too hard, almost causing a scene.  As I sauntered up to the stand, quickly regaining composure, I announced I would like to have dinner and didn't have a reservation.  There was some murmuring and they asked me to sit in the lounge while they spoke to the manager.  I didn't even have a chance to sit and they whisked me away to my table.I was seated on the bench side of a table for two, with a couple next to me and a third gentleman dining alone immediately next to them.  This is significant, because I couldn't help but eavesdrop, as it was so quiet in the restaurant and we were all in such close proximity.  The male half of the couple seated next to me, was on the opposite side of the table, and the bastard would not stop looking at me during my meal, which was frankly just weird and did detract from my overall experience.They asked me if I wanted a cocktail, and when I said Martini, they correctly assumed gin and asked for my preference.  I chose Hendricks and recommended they use a cucumber slice as a garnish.  The server came back with a perfect Martini in a crystal glass, and he told me that the bartender said 'thanks' for the idea of a cucumber garnish, that it paired perfectly - he said they would recommend it in the future.I started with amuse-bouche of a tomato puree served over a custard - perfect combination of flavors. I must take a moment as well to mention that the table setting was beautiful, all silver flatware, perfect china, and sparkling crystal vessels.  Whenever I would finish with a utensil or another dining implement, they would spirit away the offending dirty item to an impossibly large silver tray in the center of the room, which they would carry away only to immediately replace with another giant silver tray.  It was almost humorous when it was a lone cocktail glass.Next they arrived with a huge cart full of dozens of freshly-baked breads.  I spent half of my time just being walked through what was contained on the cart.  Not wanting to spoil my meal, I chose a modest selection, although the gentleman manning the cart was insistent that I try more.  I settled on a fresh Gruyère brioche  and a roll that had bacon within.  Then another fellow came by and engaged in a complex ritual where he carved fresh butter from Brittony with a chilled spoon and put it on my plate with a little fleur de sel.  The bread was incredible, unsurprisingly.Next up, I had the langoustine ravioli with truffle, cream and chopped cabbage.  Not only was it a delicate flavor explosion, it also had fantastic texture.  Thank goodness there were only three, because I am quite sure I could have eaten a bucket of them.  The next course was a fava bean soup served over a rosemary foam, again, flavors were incredible and there was just enough to get the flavor, but not too much.  During the meal, the service was not only incredibly attentive, but also not pretentious.  I really appreciated that.For my main course, I had a splendid duck breast with foie gras and almond-stuffed sweet and sour cherries.  Easily the most perfect duck I have ever partaken of, and the sommelier paired the perfect wine with it.  To finish the meal, I chose the Earl Grey rice krispy with raspberry milk mousse, a nice blend of sweet and tart.  I ordered some fantastic coffee and they ended with the dessert cart, where the gentleman who manned that cart foisted more and more treats upon me.  I especially loved the baba ahrum, caramels and the jellies he offered.I felt as one should after a repast like this, completely sated.  Price be damned, this is what culinary art tastes like.10 Things you should know about dining at Joel Robuchon:1) You will not be disappointed, except by the price which might make you cry.2) They send a free limo to pick you up and drop you off at the restaurant from wherever you're staying.3) Prepare yourself for at least a three hour meal. It's an experience afterall.4) They will ask if you want champagne when you sit down. Each glass is $35-$45. Water is $10/bottle for Evian.5) 16 Course Tasting Menu is $495/person without wine pairings - this is not listed on the website. Wine pairings go up to $999/person.6) Bread Cart - AMAZING. There are dozens of types of breads. The cheese breads and the milk bread was my favorite. They carve your butter from a magnificent butter mountain.7) What can I say about the food other than it was perfect. This is definitely a meal you will remember for the rest of your life. Every presentation, every flavor, every bite was absolute perfection. It was interesting and complex, unlike anything I've ever eaten before. You just have to try it. I recommend the Riz, a rice pilaf with sea urchin and lobster. It was my favorite course of the night.Every main course dish also comes with Robuchon's famous whipped potatoes. SO CREAMY!8) Mignardises is the sweets cart they offer at the end, full of chocolates and pastries. My favorites were the creme brulee and the cream puffs. 9) They give you a little present (if you're a girl) before you leave of chocolate and a booklet on the dining experience.10) If you're there for a special occasion, there is complementary cake (or gateau *pinky up*)PS Don't forget to ask them for their finest glass of Keystone Light#500My wife and I celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary here.  What a dining experience it was!  The complimentary gold MGM limo picking us up right in front of our place was sweet.  You must do this!  We were met by a beautiful hostess straight out of a James Bond film as we rolled up to the Mansion.  An amazing place to check out.  I guess this is what playing $25k a hand in blackjack gets you.  We had all intentions of getting the 16 course dinner but realized there was no chance whatsoever of my very petite sized wife having even a hail mary's shot at finishing.  She might've reached course 10 at best.  No problem!  Let's just fill up on champagne and do four courses.There are so many extremely detailed reviews for this restaurant.  Read all of them!  I'm only going to do notes and observations:- Is it possible to be too fancy?  This comes close. I love fine dining as much as the next fat Asian with glasses but the word "stuffy" came to mind.  Maybe my suit was too tight.  - The man, the myth, the legend was there.  Right before our appetizers (ah-hem! Une Entree) came out I heard a "Bon Soir!" from behind me and there he was in the flesh!  Joel Robuchon!!  He shook our hands.  Joel stops by the restaurant 4 times a year according to the staff and he said we were lucky to see him.  I should've asked Mr. Robuchon to sign one of the rolls from the ridiculously amazing bread cart.- The lobster salad with fruit was orgasmic.  - Whoever invented foie gras should go down in history as one of the greatest people ever.- Veal cheek kind of tasted like if a chicken thigh had sex with filet mignon.  I savored every little bite.  I believe the neighboring table shot me a look after I said this out loud to my wife.  Whatever.  More champagne please!!- They served us an extra dessert to celebrate the occasion.  It was the white and yellow meringue fruit pie cake I took a picture of.  I forgot what they said it was called. Blame it on the ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah-alcohol.  Tremendous stuff!  We ordered 2 more dessert dishes and THEN the dessert cart came out.  Wow!!3 hours later we were stuffed and ready for the limo to take us back.  A fantastic gourmet experience I would recommend to anyone.Went here on Christmas eve for a special celebration. Like most, I was excited to go to first 3 Michelin star restaurant. Was expected to be blown away by food and service and ambience. So not the case.FoodEverything was good but not great. Many of the delicious were mono-texture. Soft soft and more soft. No crunch no texture. Perhaps, I ordered the wrong dish but how many types of gelee and you put in your dish?Food temperature was good but not great. Famous Robuchon potatoes are delicious. Perfectly smooth and creamy. I think it should be called Robuchon butter served with a hint of potato.Bread and desert cart were awesome! What does that tell you when I remember the bread cart more than the meal. I could probably just eat the bread cart all night. You pick and choose your bread and then it is returned perfectly warm to mealt the smooth butter. But when you ask for seconds it comes back cold? Ok why heat the first batch and then just give me the second batch right off the cart? Which leads me to the next category....ServiceMichelin star rating is based on food and service they go hand in hand right? Wrong. We were seated, I went to the restroom. When I returned the host had dropped off the menu to the only guest at the table and left. No intro no explanation no welcome. Nada!The tablecloth had a big stain. Yes, a nasty chocolate like dish had smeared into the top fishnet pattern cloth so there was pieces of a meal embedded in the intersticies. Wow someone wasn't paying attention.I should have asked for the special limo and come in via the Mansion but were running late and had to get to a show. TipsWhen the waiter asks you for water expect to pay $10-20 a pop on the bill.Don't bother asking for the a la carte menu unless you want to pay $200 for an entree dish. You get a delicious piece of dark chocolate to go home with. My wife has gone to Per se (3 Michelin) and I have been to Coi (2 Michelin) and countless 1 Michelin star restaurants (Michael Mina, Gary Danko, Village Pub, Quince) and Robuchon is at the bottom of the list in terms of food, service and value. Next stop... the French Laundry.Ouch. Not for me. Plates are fixed price and ranged from $125 to $265 and if you want the complete 16 course meal it is $425. All of these prices are per person. Wow, who pays this price?  I love great restaurants but $950 for dinner for two? There has to be some value right? The food was good but not outrageous and very small portions. The desert was excellent but again very small. Both the bread cart and the desert cart were cool. Now lets talk service- stuffy, short, no excitement, no personality. How about the atmosphere? If you like a restaurant experience where everyone is eating in grandmas living room and no one wants to say a word without being scolded, this is your place. Too quiet for me.I would never go back to this place and would cringe if I had to return as a guest on a business trip.***Joel Robuchon features mostly modern French cuisine and elaborate setups (like huge bread and mignardises trollies, but the food is not as good as what you will find at high-end fine dining spots like Cyrus and The French Laundry)***Joel Robuchon is a very high-end fine dining restaurant located in the MGM Grand.  I've dined at two of Robuchon's L'atelier restaurants (one in Tokyo and one in Vegas that sits right next to Joel Robuchon).  I enjoyed both of them.  They were French restaurants, but they were not too heavy.  They were more contemporary with light preparations and lively flavors.Joel Robuchon is a more formal and traditional French spot.  There are definitely modern touches.  Joel Robuchon updates several traditional French dishes to make them more contemporary; L'atelier though utilizes more modern techniques and even fusion elements to create dishes that feel entirely new.Joel Robuchon offers several menus including an option to build your own tasting of 2-6 courses or a full tasting, which is 16 courses and an incredible amount of food.  Regardless of how many courses you opt for, there seems to be enough mini courses (like an elaborate bread cart and an extravagant mignardises trolley) to keep you from leaving hungry.With the bread cart and the mignardises trolley, I immediately thought Cyrus (a great restaurant that will be closing soon) when I dined here.  It also has similarities to The French Laundry in terms of the elaborate courses and the showcase of premium ingredients.  While I thought there were many great things about Robuchon, it was definitely not as good as those two restaurants.Part of it has to do with the produce.  I think Cyrus and The French Laundry have much better access to fresh fruits and vegetables.  The sourcing of the proteins is noticeable too.  Even though Joel Robuchon utilizes more premium ingredients than Cyrus, I felt Cyrus' proteins felt fresher and were handled with more care.  Because of this, I think the flavors pop at Cyrus and The French Laundry more.Cyrus and The French Laundry also just serve up more contemporary and interesting food.  The food feels more with the times, lighter and more creative.There were some great dishes at Robuchon though.  Caviar is nicely done here--paired with a cold and creamy cauliflower soup as well as fresh and soft hamachi sashimi.  The grilled lobster tail with herb sabayon was very good (great cooking of the lobster tail--very flavorful outside with a moist and soft inside).I liked the scallop too (nicely moist and served with a good leek curry).  The truffled langoustine ravioli was also good--nice thickness on the pasta.The caramel panna cotta, which also had a great ice cream, was very satisfying even if the garnish of strawberries was not that great.  And the attention to detail on the bread and mignardises really paid off.  The gruyere brioche was light, crispy and cheesy and the mignardises trolley featured an unbelievable amount of variety including chocolates, lollipops, little cakes, marshmallows, pate de fruit, caramels, macarons, and so on.  The best thing about it was though that despite the huge number of mignardises they make, several of them were very fresh and good.But there were definitely spots where Joel Robuchon struggled when compared to California restaurants.  Their tomato salad is supposed to be bright and vibrant as well as very modern.  Unfortunately, the tomatoes were not nearly as sweet and juicy as what you will find at Lucques (Lucques has a better flavor combination too by featuring fragrant basil and creamy burrata).  The Bazaar's caprese salad is also much more modern than Robuchon's tomato salad.Robuchon's salmon is very nicely cooked, but I didn't like the flavors of mango and mustard that they chose to go with it--both strong flavors and a little too contrasting.  The beef ribeye here was very flavorful and tender, but the garnish of capers was too overpowering.  I was excited about trying their chocolate souffle and it had a great lift, but it had a weird texture.  It was almost like a marshmallow.  It made the souffle feel dry--maybe more vanilla bean ice cream or a creme anglaise would have helped.Service was very polite, professional and attentive, but I felt it was too stiff.  It is probably just the style that they are going for, but Cyrus manages to be both formal and personable.  The dining room is very formal and high-end too.  I wasn't a big fan of all the decoration though--it made the room feel cluttered.Prices are very high, but they do serve a generous amount of food.Joel Robuchon provides a very extravagant dining experience and one that you cannot easily find elsewhere.  Still, I prefer L'atelier much more and I would highly recommend The French Laundry over it.  But it is a very renowned restaurant and worth considering if you want to try Vegas' best.MGM Grand offers both complimentary valet and self parking.Fantastique!I have been planning to go to Robuchon for a long time but never went.  Last night before seeing MGM's Crazy Horse Paris before it closes, I decided to make it a grand evening of food and entertainment.The meal.  I selected the 6 course meal.  For an amuse-bouche, they brought a bowl of avocado foam with grapefruit and apple.  Smoke was coming out from the sides of the bowl from a couple of pieces of dry ice concealed in the lower section.  The bowl was sitting on a plate that had apples all over it.  The smoking bowl and the apple plate went with the restaurant's fall theme.  It was very pleasing to the eye and to the palate.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0HgBefore the first course, the server came with the bread cart.  I chose a bacon bread and a basil roll.  He took them away to be warmed and while they were being warmed, he pulled a nice curl of butter from the large bell shaped mound of butter.  On this curl, he spooned some coarse sea salt.  Perfect!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#cG0hupMF2hno9oNJFQzTFAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#vhZqX8iJde17fytPkzjdYgThe first course was spiced lobster in a cold cauliflower soup with botargo shavings.  This was excellent.  The lobster and the cauliflower made a good combination.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#qEPSaCG4mph3gwtwMSCgkASecond course was a pumpkin velouté with foie gras, ginger foam, and toasted seeds.  The pumpkin velouté was poured into the foam from a separate container by the server.  There were also small cubes of pumpkin for texture in the velouté.  Very tasty pumpkin flavor with the lovely ginger to add an extra layer of flavor.  The foie gras was superb!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#Yoc7fLdK93DmTfocE3vS2gFor the third course, I went back to lobster.  I got the spiny lobster served with yucca root in a green curry with fresh coriander.  Another winner.  Very good.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#vMMAmXsQT8J7zxTXCmYRqAFor the fourth course, I chose a special that wasn't on the menu.  They had lamb chops and lamb loin.  It was very flavorful.  With this course, they brought some pommes purée and a finger bowl with a slice of lemon and one rose petal.  After all, you have to clean your fingers after picking up the lamb chop to finish the meat from the bone.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#anOfKURZUpLKafsNDbh6ewhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#QtU_80wjNrJZwFrVkYQpOghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#zFf11ODymwTGaz2wovhjiAThe 5th course was the cheese course.  By now, I was feeling full and I knew there were more good things to come.  I chose three cheeses--some bleu, a French hard cheese similar to manchego, and a soft sheep's milk cheese.  All three were good, but the bleu was outstanding!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#1ZeLTWxdkqNNrSQ0cK09zwWith the cheese course, you were brought a raisin roll.  It really adds to the cheese flavors.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#zAdat0jo4ZV4Z5YH-fhq9QFor the last course, dessert, I ordered the pistachio mousse glazed with chocolate ganache and raspberry gelée.  Heavenly, rich, dark chocolate!!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#XqZUNyWMVX8_poZCZExiMwLast, the mignardises trolley was wheeled to the table. Wow.  Such a choice.  I took three, a dark chocolate demi-macaron, a vanilla macaron, and a small tartlet with raspberry and cream.  What a delightful way to end a meal and now I was very full.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#wf4xOVg4-mfqu0liI7xk6QService was exemplary!  There wasn't one staff member who wasn't polite and who didn't have a smile.  The whole package--the food, the fall theme with the flowers of reds and oranges, the plates with apples and pumpkins, the service and the general ambience of this quiet, elegant restaurant--makes for a fine dining experience.  I'd love to go back and try the 14 course menu but I'm afraid I couldn't eat that much. Thanks to my Yelp friends who encouraged me to go here and gave me pointers, especially Rod and Marcus!i have too many wonderful things to say about this restaurant!  where do i start....when i first walked it, it was not what i expected.  they have the bar area to the right and it is really dark and small.  the chairs seem too large for the tables.  the sommelier happened to be there as i was selecting a glass of wine and let me try a sample of the shiraz.  i opted for the pinot noir which was light and smooth.  we were seated almost immediately.  we sat at a table in the "garden" area to the right of the dining room.  it's a very quaint and romantic spot (too bad i was dining with my boss!).  if you are going on a romantic date or celebrating an anniversary, ask for a table in the garden.i won't say too much about service, but it was impeccable.  we had about 3-4 people attending to us throughout the meal and each one was polite and helpful.  they would even wait for us to finish our conversation before interrupting.the food.  do not expect to come in here and spend less than $200/person (including drinks/etc).  they have different meal options for you to choose from with the smallest option starting at $129.  they have a 16 course meal for $485/person.  i opted for an app + entree, which was $169.  first off, their bread is to die for.  they have 2 types of bread with cheese and i tried one of each.  they have tons of other bread, even ones with bacon.  they warm the bread up for you and it's so good.  they give you butter from france with sea salt and olive oil, but the bread is so yummy on its own, you do not need to add anything to it.i started with the foie gras and artichoke salad.  it was uh-mazing!  the foie gras melted in your mouth and the artichoke had a great marinade. for my entree, it was a no brainer - i had the spaghetti with sea urchin and caviar.  it was an additional supplement of around $40, i believe, but it was worth every penny!  they give you 4 pieces of sea urchin, a soft boiled egg and caviar sprinkled on top.  the spaghetti sauce was so creamy and buttery - i have no words.  amazing.they give you a side of the chef's mashed potatoes.  the waiter said, and i quote "i hope you like butter".  nuff said.this is an amazing dining experience.  it's definitely not an every day meal, but given a reason, i'd come back in a heart beat!I'm sorry. I tried. I really did. But Joël Robuchon fell short. Very short. Please let me preface this by stating, in my opinion no meal, unless you choose it to be so, should be four hours long. And, let me state that my rating takes in to consideration the "experience" of dining at Joël Robuchon, which reaches beyond the food itself.My wife and I celebrated our 20 year anniversary by a trip to what may be considered the best restaurant in Las Vegas, or possibly the country. It started off with a bang and initially, I was truly enjoying the experience. We arrived and were promptly seated. I was surprised by the size of the restaurant as it was quite small, which was very nice actually. The quaintness of the size kept the sound down and made the experience much more personal. And, the design of the restaurant was contemporary and modern without being too over the top "mod" like many other Vegas eateries.One issue to note that was a arguing point with my wife and I was the strict dress policy for gentleman. Jacket and tie are required. No big deal. Happy to put it on for the anniversary. However, when I dine, I prefer not to wear a tie, like most men. I had a very nice suit and shirt, but knowing Las Vegas, I preferred not to wear a tie. My wife insisted so I begrudgingly put a tie on.Again, "jacket and tie are required" to me means just that. As we walk in, there were many men dressed well in jacket and tie, sitting right next to other couples who's men were wearing jeans, sports coat with open collared, button down shirt with a t-shirt underneath.Point: If you have a dress code, enforce it or why even bother.Service began very attentively and the pacing was fantastic. The menu was described well and we were enjoying the experience. The pace of the meal is important to me and everything was going well. Drinks were ordered, wine with assistance of the sommelier, our dining selection made, all is well with the world. The bread and courses began. The bread selection was impressive and the knowledge of the waitstaff impressive. Everything was amazing. Pre appetizer, appetizer, soup, wine, cocktails, mineral water, water, music, perfect. Presentation was artistically superb.And then, something happened. Maybe a shift change (joke) or possibly the world started rotating backwards? Time space continuum shift? Who knows. While waiting for our main course, the service came to a crawl. Attentive still but very, very slow. It took 45 mins before our last appetizer and our main courses to arrive.I ordered the Beef Cheeks as I was feeling like having beef. They arrived nicely appointed. Slicing into them they were very tender, in a miso based sauce. The problem immediately was taste. It literally tasted like my mothers pot roast. This couldn't be so I tried again. And sure enough, mom's pot roast. I asked my wife if she wanted to try as I explained my dilemma. And sure enough, I could see the disappointment on her face as everything else had been so delightful.Ok, one bad dish, albeit the main course, I'm willing to overlook it. However, we're now stuck with this issue with service. It's getting slower and slower and slower. The pace between the next few courses was just painfull. Time between our main course and dessert was another 45 mins. Then our anniversary cake. Then we were politely told that the dessert tray needed to be replenished. Very politely and with courtesy, but we'd already had been there for three hours and I was getting testy.The dessert tray was a work of art and the man in charge of them extremely knowledgeable. They were fantastic as well.One thing to note. I ordered sparkling mineral water and my glass barely had a sip out of it and it was refreshed by the wait staff. Fantastic! However, once it was empty, the bottle removed but I remained thirsty. I had to ask for water three times. Each time it came promptly but being thirsty, I drank it and i had to again ask for it to be refilled. Additionally, I enjoy cold water. This water was room temperature. No problem. I'll just request ice water, which I did and I still got the same room temperature water.Post meal, a nice little bag was given with a great brochure recapping our meal which was a nice touch. Then our check came in a very timely manner, which was as expected. So, what is my main complaint? No complaint actually. More of a disappointment really. My low rating was purely based on meeting expectations for a well rounded dining experience supposedly one of the best in the country. I expected a world class experience and didn't get it. I felt the pacing of the meal started out perfectly, after the main course however, I'm unsure as to what happened. The main course was a disappointment.The wait staff delightful and extremely knowledgeable and very friendly.Overall, my wife enjoyed it very much and that's all that matters. ;)~Went there on June 2012, and this horrible dinner is still seared in my mind & it was so disappointing because I planned our entire anniversary trip around this dinner. The most ahhhmazing part was when the car rolled up to the villa and the gates parted and than you are ushered into this plush, decadent restaurant. I should have known something was up since it was so easy to get reservation. We ordered the Menu A $250 per person. It was so bad that after the third course, my BF said he had enough and wanted to go eat something that's edible, but being Chinese I insisted we trudge on through as to not let food go to waste. The alcohol drink we ordered was nasty too. Short Review: Save your money, don't go here! Unremarkable food, paired with bad service. Long Review:Here's what we ordered:1A) Green Asparagus...What a joke, anybody could have made it, no creativity to it.1B) Spiced Lobster...My fave dish that night, but I'm partial to lobster.2A) Green Pea Cream Soup...Good, but not memorable.2B) Light Daikon soup...Good, but not memorable. 3A) Pan Fried Sea Bass...Fish was fresh, but not memorable. (A running theme of Robuchon.)3B) Grilled Spiny Lobster...Came out cold. I asked the Waiter, if this is normal, he said he will check with the kitchen and redo it. When he came back with the new dish, he made a jeering remark to the gist of, "Next time, don't take so long to take photos." WTF? Taking a couple of shots is not long enough to turn a dish cold.Than came the longest wait in the world for the fourth course. WE WAITED ALMOST AN HOUR FOR THE NEXT COURSE. Nobody came to apologize. There is no way that they didn't know about this because an integral part of fine dining is the timing of the dishes of when they are served.  4A) Roasted duck...Okay.4B) Beef cheeks...It was very tender, but the sauce was average. The Mashed Potatoes. It was ahhhmazing. If this was the only course served, than Joel deserves 5 stars. Just give me a bucket of this and I am a happy camper.  5) Instead of Cheese Course we requested a substitute and they gave us the Risotto of Soybeans Sprouts. It was so salty...inedible. At that time, I was too afraid to say anything, lest I get another reprimand from the waiter. The waiter didn't even bother asking why we didn't finish the course. 6A) La Fraise: Nasty tasting, served in a tacky serve ware. 6B) Le Chocolat: Also nasty, and tacky looking, why is there peacock feathers surrounding it?Than while we are eating our desserts, strangely they appeared with a cake, say happy anniversary, than walked off. Nice gesture, but the entire event was strange.  They will serve you a slice and the rest of the cake is thrown away. What a waste.At the end of the meal, they roll out this beautiful dessert cart and tell you choose whatever mignardises you want. However, you are not allowed to take any of it to go. Huh? What kind of policy is this, I never had happened to me at a fine dining establishment. By that time, after this long drawn ordeal, I'm tired, my BF pissed. I randomly chose a few to try, but still you wouldn't want to take these home, even if you could. Verdict: Save your time and money and go splurge elsewhere.IMPECCABLE.  Food, service, staff, ambiance...everything was just impeccable.We chose the 6 course dinner each and we were there from 5:30pm to 10:30pm.-The L'Amuse-bouche:  a small bite that excited my palate.Bread cart approached me and oh how I tried to so hard to limit myself to 3...we were given olive oil and salt sprinkled butter to enjoy with the bread.-Soup: Delicate tofu velouté with lemon zest on warm seaweed gelée, smoked and caramelized eel.  This has layers and layers of flavor.-Appetizer: langoustine ravioli with truffle, cream and chopped cabbage-1st Main Course: Black Cod with a yuzu daikon velvet puree**after the 1st main course, I was pretty full.-2nd Main Course: Duck and seared foie gras with sweet and sour cherries, fresh almonds.  This dish was very delicious, but again, I was full at this point, I could not finish my plate.  I still had a piece of foie gras, and almost 2 pieces of duck left...I had to tap out.**we ordered some hot tea to help us stay awake.  When we were ready, the cheese cart came by.-Fromage:  So many different cheese!  Our awesome server brought out some fruits for us to enjoy with the cheese.  He was also kind enough to write down our favorite cheese on a piece of paper for our future reference.-Dessert 1: Strawberry Daiquiri with yogurt sorbet and pop rocks - yummy yummy joy joy for my tummy.  Who knew pop rocks will elevate such dessert...GENIUS.  I loved it.-Dessert 2:Raspberry milk mousse, spiced raspberry sorbet, earl grey puffed rice krispies and pistachio foam.  Ahhh, the pop rocks...oh wait, I was going to write about the Dessert 2...it was different.-Mignardises: Finally, the dessert cart.  Unlimited amount of macarons..all the items on this cart was just delicious.  Our server knew how stuffed we were so he packed us two small boxes filled with delicious chocolate delights in them.Before we left, they gave us a gift bag with the menu, rosemary bread, and a booklet of Joel Robuchon Restaurant, with Chef''s bio, menus, etc.Joel Robuchon at MGM Grand has to be the #1 Restaurant on my list.Visit three, Items experienced:Le Coeur Rouge - Pomegranate Juice, Muddled Orange and Cherry, SpriteLe Maize - Corn Veloute, Honey and Ginger Crouton, Smoked Duck, Milk MarshmallowBread Service: Mini Baguette, Yeast Bun, Mini Croissant, Gruyere Brioche, Potato Bread, Comte Baguette, Rustic Loaf, Saffron Focaccia, Milk Bread, Bacon with Whole Grain Mustard, Traditional Baguette, Olive Baguette, Basil Focaccia, Brioche with Roasted Sea Salt, French Butter with Sea Salt and Olive OilLe Foie Gras - Carpaccio of Foie Gras and Potatoes Covered with Black Truffle ShavingsLe Kabocha - Kabocha Pumpkin Veloute with Foie Gras, Ginger Foam, Toasted SeedsLes Spaghettis - Homemade Spaghetti Topped with Soft Boiled Egg, Urchin, CaviarLa Pintade Fermiere - French Hen with Roasted Foie Gras, Confit Potatoes au JusCheese Course with Raisin roll, Wildflower honey; Haystack Peak, Cremont, 2 Year Comte, Tomme de Brebis, Pont l'evequeLe Ruby - Raspberry Dome on Mascarpone Cream, Cranberries, Cranberry Coulis, Japanese YogurtLe Chocolat - Apple Compote infused with Hibiscus, topped with Chocolate Tuille, Dark Chocolate Sorbet, Gold LeafPetit Fours - Pineapple Financier, Vanilla Macaron, Passionfruit Marshmallow, Apple Cupcake with Caramel Icing, Religeuse, Pear Gelee, Almond Cluster, Cinnamon Meringue, Chocolate Caramels,  Hazelnut/Rum/Banana/Chinese Five Spice Milk Chocolate, Yuzu/Pistachio/Coffee/Passionfruit Dark Chocolate, Coffee Opera Cake, Mango Tarte, Coffee Éclair, Pineapple Tart, Nougat, Blueberry White Chocolate, Citrus Tuille, Hazelnut Bon-Bon, Lemon Tartelette, Dark Chocolate Macaron, Orange Lollipop, Guava Pate a Fruit, Canale, Mini Chocolate Hazelnut Tart, Crème Brulee, Panna CottaOrange Sorbet, Caramel Ice Cream, Orange Spice, Anise, Ginger, Caramel Drizzle CakeTake home gift - Raspberry and Pistachio Pound Cake...while some may believe that one cannot buy class, in Las Vegas I'm rather certain that one can buy a close semblance to anything, a fact evidenced by the t-shirt and track suit clad group sitting a few tables down from me as the clock turned to Christmas 2012 while I enjoyed a complimentary piece of Orange Ice cream cake that pastry chef Kamel Guechida had crafted for the questionably clad but clearly affluent Europeans who were celebrating a birthday in addition to the holidays at Vegas' most glitzy restaurant.  Having already dined at Joel Robuchon twice myself this was not the first time I'd seen such generosity from the kitchen of "The Chef of the Century" and much like my previous visits the meal was an exercise in refinement; the room, the food, and the service all well-manicured, highly polished, and lavish.Taking a 9:00pm reservation and arriving early only to be identified by name as the doors swung open on my approach I was subsequently seated at the same table I'd dined at during my first visit and greeted by a familiar service team including the same dining room manager and server as my prior visit much of what would follow was familiar; the plethoric bread cart and equally impressive cheese course followed by a dessert trolley with nearly three dozen options plus the signature pound cake, though this time smaller than prior.  Deferring on coffee I was additionally treated to a hand clipped tea and infusions cart and a $10 flat charge brought no less than three bottles of Evian - no doubt the cost of admission warrants these things as well as the impressive "Ruby" palate cleanser and "Maize" amuse - gifts that would constitute proper courses at many restaurants.Moving on to what was ordered I once again opted to order from the prix fixe as opposed to the larger grand tasting and making a special request for the (menu price $300 if ordered ALC) Pintade Fermiere my only small complaint regarding the entire evening was that Chef Le Tohic felt need to visit my table before the hen's preparation to suggest I'd be better off only ordering half the bird as I'd have gladly (and greedily,) eaten more of the crispy skin and supple flesh sandwiched around thick, buttery, foie gras...though I guess saving the $60 supplement charge was a benefit.Truffles, foie gras, uni, foie gras, caviar, and more foie gras plus aged comte, spell-binding desserts, and a room and service beyond reproach I can think of much worse ways to celebrate Christmas Eve than with Joel Robuchon's team at the MGM and although I personally would never do so in a T-shirt there is something refreshing about the fact that in a city where there are so many bad high-stakes bets this is a place where anyone willing and able to spend the money is virtually guaranteed an excellent return.There is absolutely no reason to go to Joel Robuchon unless you're curious about what it's like to spend a lot of money for hit-or-miss food and service that does not resemble a 3-star Michelin restaurant in the slightest.I've eaten at L'Atelier Joel Robuchon in both Paris and LV.  I very much enjoyed both experiences.  I didn't feel like I over-spent for those experiences.  In fairness, I knew ahead of time that spending $435 for a 16-course tasting menu would probably be disappointing, because how could it not? It's $435 for a meal.  I was, however, hoping I might find something over the course of 3 hours to justify it.  The food: Within the 16 courses, I enjoyed the Le Caviar trio, the La Saint-Jacques (pan seared sea scallop), the Les Crustaces trio (crab and sea urchin, and I didn't actually like the sea urchin dish), Le Boeuf, and both desserts.  My sea bass was overcooked, and the foie gras in broth was one of the worst preparations of foie gras I've tasted; it was umami done wrong.  (L'Atelier has much better preparations.) The bread and sweets were pretty good, however.  But for $435 I should be lauding this place.  I had a better tasting menu at The Pass (non-Michelin rated) in Houston, and a better experience with service.The service: It made me question the last time Joel Robuchon was reviewed by the Michelin Guide.  There was no finesse or fluidity to service.  I was privy to loud whispers between waitstaff.  The bread tray was constantly hitting the back of where I was sitting on its way to-and-fro.  And, to top it off, when a waiter picked up the signed check from the patron to my left (who, admittedly, got a little snippy with waitstaff), I could see him roll his eyes and huff upon looking at the check.  As a diner, I should not see any of this at any Michelin rated restaurant, let alone a 3-star.  Look, all this Michelin star restaurant stuff can get  pretentious.  I keep exclaiming about it because I'm beginning to think the emperor has no clothes with a lot of these restaurants.  In particular, Joel Robuchon.  But I would go to either L'Atelier again.Joël Robuchon was the choice for the girlfriend and my dinner on our first night in Vegas.  While there were plenty of other, much less expensive, restaurants I could've taken my girlfriend, unbeknownst to her, I planned to propose to her over dinner and the occasion called for something special.  Upon stepping through the door and up until we left several hours later, Joël Robuchon exuded style, class, opulence, and Franco/Vegas charm in all facets of its operation. We elected to have the 16 (or so)-course degustation menu.  The team of wait staff was off the charts with its informed, surgically precise, personable, but never "stuffy" service throughout our meal.  Likewise, the sommelier was spot on with her wine recommendations (we had two splits, one white and one red), which were surprisingly affordable and very well suited complements to the varied courses of food received.Our meal started off with a bread cart, which was more aptly described as a boulangerie on wheels.  Every type of French style bread or roll was present and was served with amazingly creamy butter and an exotic sea salt.  After the bread, came our culinary Tour de Force.  We received the following...La Cerise - Cherry gazpacho with pistachios and ricotta ice creamLa Tomate - Salad of tomato with basil infused olive oil, tomato gelée topped with mozzarella  Le Caviar - Red turnip and radish with yellowtail carpaccio, delicate cream of corn, caviar on a fennel cream served as a surpriseLa Saint-Jacques - Pan seared sea scallop in green curry and fresh corianderLes Crustacés - Truffled langoustine ravioli, Sea urchin prepared in "chaud-froid" with anise juices, spiny lobster served atop spinach in a black Malabar pepper sauceLes Petits Pois - Sweet green pea veloute with vegetable aroma and hints of mintLe Foie Gras - Seared foie gras with red berries and kumquat compoteLe Bar - Pan-fried sea bass with a lemon grass foam and stewed baby leeksLe Boeuf - Grilled beef rib-eye, black olive and bone marrow condimentLe Broccolini - Broccollini and soybean sprouts cooked as a risottoLe Pop-Fraise - Fresh strawberries and strawberry mousse with Rosé Champagne cream and soursop sorbetLe Dome - Black fruits on a delicate chocolate fondant and dolce.Our meal closed with the Le Moka-Le Thé, a cart filled with over 35 different Mignardises.  It was the proverbial sweet finale to an amazing meal!  Every course was beautiful in its presentation, but easily matched by the complex, yet exquisite flavors delivered with every bite.  In truth, I can't pick a favorite course since they were each amazing in their own unique way.  It was definitely not traditional French bistro fare.  Joël Robuchon was the perfect choice for our most special occasion.  I highly recommend it for yours.  And if you were still wondering...she did say, "Yes".Not sure what else I can add to all the great reviews this joint has gotten, but here goes nothing. We ordered the 17 course tasting menu. I won't go over each course, but trust me when I say that they were all virtually flawless. I will, however, highlight my favorite parts of this dining experience.The service - impeccable and efficient. I've never seen a machine work so smoothly. The front and back waiters were exceptionally knowledgeable, warm and friendly. The only snootiness I detected was from the suited up captain. Luckily, all he did was present us with the menus and take our order.The Bread cart - outrageous and extravagant. Hands down, the best bread I've ever had.The butter - yes. You read correctly. The butter is imported from Brittany and had such a smooth, creamy texture and an almost yeasty, cheese-like taste.The caviar course - hamachi with baby radish, olive oil and lemon; corn pudding with cream; crab salad served in a caviar tin...all topped with golden osetra caviar. Nuff said.The cheese cart - they import their cheese from France (illegally I guess) and you can tell. I've never had cheese like this before. If there is ever a time to say OMG about anything, this is it. OH EM GEE.Again, not to disparage the other courses, but in the interest of time and nonboredomness (?), those were my favorites. A once in a lifetime meal.There is no question or doubt in my mind that Joël Robuchon deserves nothing less than five stars and is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.My company was hosting its annual holiday Vegas vacation, so I knew I wanted to dine somewhere nice as I rarely ever get the chance to when in Sin City with friends (typical meals include McDonald's, Earl's, and a buffet). I made reservations easily on the phone a month in advance and inquired about the complimentary limo service. I was told to call back 7-days before my dinner reservation to reserve. I called back 6-days before and was told there was no availability and was put on a waiting list. So when they say to call a week in advance, you better call a week in advance.Our party of four didn't end up getting limo service or The Mansion tour, but Joël Robuchon is truly a beautiful restaurant and amazing enough on its own. Our jaws dropped in awe from the opulent décor, grandiose chandelier, and elegant royal purple theme. The ambiance is lovely, romantic, and simply stunning.LibationsMoscato ($15)Chivas Regal 18 Year ($20)Evian water bottles ($10 each)Amuse-BoucheRed Beet Gazpacho with Burrata, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#3oWOowMNY6iN_soX-Eah_QBread Servicehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7AThe bread cart was intense, with more than 10 different selections to choose from.4-course Prix Fixe Menu ($198 pp)Le Homard, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#M31VHoxg2XlA8imP1e9v0ALe Navet Rouge, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#Hm5SMsybvCM270IRJd_uVwLe Champignon Paris (suppl. $65), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#dKGS7p4_0ODNfM6paeJr4ALa Langoustine (suppl. $35), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#ZEUpkrMTmO2BU2UKkNYxJQLe Bar, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#O3RixLub7PnheTlMKKWNAgLa Langouste, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#T8m9o_Ti8yuRziwn9WwY7ALe Bœuf, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#0k-Ci5zOxqTBKduWc_llgwLa Sphère, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#EyRsCosnHxDKeZJhT9z4EQLes Herbes, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#ReJ-UiMju0OZkN-hSIz7qQLe Soufflé (suppl. $15), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#dUlLKBG9VWN0Ag1gKGKHUgMignardiseshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#BtWcKw5jrQKx8nNcMLUfjAThe mignardises cart was equally as impressive and stunning as the bread cart. There were over 20 selections of different sweet treats to choose from; it was pretty overwhelming. I wish I could've tried everything but I really didn't want to look like a fatty. My favorites from the cart were the canelés and macarons.Everything was delicious. The appetizers, the mains, the desserts, everything. I've been to 1- and 2-Michelin-star restaurants before, and now I finally know that that one extra star truly does make a difference. Le Homard (spiced lobster) was my favorite appetizer, followed by Le Navet Rouge (scallops). For my main, I ordered Le Bar (grilled sea bass), which was good but lost the round to La Langouste (spiny lobster) and Le Bœuf (braised beef cheeks). If I were to go back again, I'd definitely get the the beef cheeks; they were so tender and flavorful. Dessert was amazing -- if you're ordering any, you must get La Sphère, a bubble sugar sphere filled with blueberries, yogurt sorbet, candied lemon, and violet cream. It was so pretty and made my sweet tooth very happy. Le Soufflé is also a must! Not too sweet, not too bitter, it went terrifically well with the vanilla ice cream it was served with. Perfect ending to a fantastic dinner. I would have to say however, both the amuse-bouche and mignardises were fairly mediocre when compared to the rest.Service was good. Our water glasses were constantly refilled (explains how we ended up with a $40 tab on water alone), timing between courses was perfect (though there was a little hiccup between our last dessert course and mignardises), and while the staff was supremely attentive, they were also generally unobtrusive.After our meal ended, the ladies in our group were each presented with a giant loaf of bread in a purple gift bag. If your meal doesn't fill you up, this bread definitely will.Michelin: 3 stars (2009)Can't believe that I've written 399 reviews already. To celebrate the 400th review, I saved it for one of the best meals/experience I ever had. Its no wonder the man is named Chef of the Century. His namesake restaurant incorporates attention to food and service like no other restaurant I've been to. After reading reviews from fellow yelpers, I knew I had to call a week ahead to ask for a limo reservation.  On the night of our reservation, a gold limo came to pick us up at the Mandalay Bay. It drove us to the MGM and dropped us off right in front of the secret entrance to the MGM residences in the back of the hotel. We got a quick glimpse of the place as we walked through it. The garden courtyard, looked like an outdoor garden, was actually indoors. Our hostess told us a night in one of these rooms start at $10K. I guess I'll just stick with the free walkthrough of the place instead. The walkthrough eventually leads us back to the general public casino of the MGM, right next to Joel Robuchon and L'Atelier. Our hostess took our coats and brought stools for all the ladies' purses. Our servers quickly brought us menus and took our drink orders. Once all our orders were taken, the magic began! First up was the butter and olive oil cart. Prepared tableside, the server scrapes two layers of butter and sprinkles fleur de sel on it carefully. He explained that the butter was from Britain. Next he pours olive oil from spain into small bowls. Next up was the bread cart! I think I ate about 6 or 7 different kinds of bread. I already told myself not to eat too much in order to save room for the rest of the meal, but the bread was just so irresistible! My faves were the Milk bread, Basil bread, Bacon bread, Croissant and the Cheese brioche (in no particular order). The first time they bring the bread cart around to take everyone's order, they'll actually bring the bread back to the kitchen to warm it up. Afterwards, they just bring an assorted tray around to see if anyone wants more bread. The ones on the tray don't get warmed up! They came by 4 times to offer us more bread throughout the meal. Our amuse bouche for the night was beets soup with marscapone cheese. I don't like beets, but even I found this to be quite delicious! The presentation and choice of serving ware was spot on. For the appetizer, I had the Lobster with truffle. It came with three huge pieces of perfectly cooked lobster, topped with three big pieces of winter truffles. The sauce complimented the lobster perfectly without overpowering the flavor of the truffles. The next appetizer I had was the Crispy soft boiled egg with truffles. The egg was perfect, with yolk slowly oozing out as you cut into it! For my entree, I had the chicken with foie gras. This dish required an extra supplement, which I think is totally worth it since California no longer has foie gras available. The chicken and foie gras come served in a big pot, and is presented to you tableside as the server carefully plates the contents onto a plate for you. The chicken was so juicy and moist, and the foie gras was so rich. My only complaint was that the sauce was a bit salty for my taste. For dessert, I had the Herb sorbet with sabayon. This was the perfect palate cleanser. So refreshing yet the perfect sweet ending to the meal. One of my friends ordered the sugar sphere with orange mousse. This was an amazing presentation. The clear and shiny sphere of sugar was filled with orange mousse. It was really too beautiful to crack open to eat! And of course the best part of the meal, the dessert cart, comes to finish off our experience here. The cart has over 40 things. By the time the server went through everything on the cart, I already forgot what were the items he mentioned in the beginning. But he was so patient with us and answered our questions as we pointed and asked him what certain items were again and again. The cart has small candies and chocolates, to french macarons, to lollipops and marshmallows, to even small desserts (creme brulee, panna cotta). I felt like a little kid in a candy store! My favorite items were the yuzu truffle, the blueberry cheesecake bite, and the pineapple pop. Before our meal came to an end, the server brought all the ladies at the table a gift bag. It came with a loaf of cake and a glossy picture book of the dishes at the restaurant (some of them were the ones we ate). When we were about ready to go, we let the hostess know for her to get the limo ready. Once the limo arrived, she walked us back through the MGM residences to our limo which took us back to the Mandalay Bay. Overall, this place is worth every single penny. The experience as a whole was flawless. Service was spot on, food was beyond expectations, and presentation of everything was a masterpiece. Every dish looked too beautiful to eat! I definitely will be coming back to try the 16 course!***Joel Robuchon is considered by some as one of the best restaurants in the U.S.; I think the food here is good and the bread and mignardises trolleys provide a luxurious abundance you just cannot get elsewhere, but I actually prefer L'atelier de Joel Robuchon next door; that Robuchon restaurant serves much more contemporary, creative, vibrant, and lighter French cuisine***Because of its three Michelin stars rating (back when Michelin used to rate Vegas restaurants), Joel Robuchon is a restaurant many seek out for a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience.  I dined at Joel Robuchon a few years ago and I thought it was good but not as good as other great high-end restaurants I have tried in San Francisco and Chicago (I would also put it below the two L'atelier de Joel Robuchon restaurants I have tried--one in Vegas and another in Tokyo).As good as Michelin is at selecting truly special restaurants, it still gives a little too much praise to restaurants from legendary French chefs like Joel Robuchon, Guy Savoy and Jean-Georges Vongerichten.  For me, these acclaimed French restaurants feel like places where the celebrity chef is not really there that often.  In addition, the food at these French spots just feel outdated and heavy and nowhere near as exciting as the progressive cuisine that restaurants like Manresa, Saison, wd~50, and Graham Elliot serve.I did think the bread trolley and mignardises trolleys at Joel Robuchon on my first visit were very exceptional--both of these trolleys did deliver the kind of great flavors and textures as well as luxurious presentation that you just cannot find elsewhere (even at great restaurants).  My first trip to Joel Robuchon was for their tasting menu and it was way too much food and it kind of dulled the experience.My dinner the second time around was a smaller set menu and it actually resulted in a more enjoyable experience even if the food was nowhere near the quality and creativity of The French Laundry or Quince.Dinner started with a refreshing gazpacho served with creamy burrata and really good extra virgin olive oil.  Next up was a good salad of leafy greens, artichokes, shaved foie gras torchon (creamy, savory and meaty), crostini, and shaved Parmesan.A warm, sweet and velvety kabocha veolute was the next course.  It was garnished with really good roasted chestnuts, mushrooms and truffle.The fish course was smoked and then roasted black cod.  The fish flaked very nicely and easily.  The fish was very soft and moist.  I enjoyed the light eggplant puree sauce that the fish sat in; the eggplant puree sauce was brightened up by good yuzu.  The fish was topped with good asparagus.The meat course was a braised beef cheek wrapped in pasta; it was served with nicely braised winter vegetables, red miso and ginger.  The beef cheek was good; it was very savory, juicy, tender, and quite rich.  The beef cheek was finished off with Joel Robuchon's signature mashed potatoes, which were rich, buttery, thick, smooth, and creamy (the staff at all of Robuchon's restaurants tout this side and it is very memorable for such a simple starch).Dessert was a fragrant green chartreuse sabayon with refreshing herb sherbet and a nice hazelnut praline at the bottom (mostly sweet but also a little bit salty and a great crispy, wafer-like consistency).The dinner ended with some good mignardises of mini macarons, chocolates, truffles, pate de fruit, and canele.Service was very good--professional and polite but also friendly (I felt the service was much more personable on this visit).The dining room has kind of an over-the-top luxurious look with purple contrasting strongly with black as well as chandeliers.Prices are very high (even for Vegas standards), but there are a few menu options including the ability to get just 3 or 4 courses; this might be more than enough food given the generous amount of complimentary breads and mignardises served here.I enjoyed my experience at Joel Robuchon more this time because the food felt a lot lighter.  Still, the food at Joel Robuchon feels dated in parts and for a high-end French restaurant, I prefer the more modern but still classically French Melisse in LA or the French seafood restaurant Le Bernardin where the seafood and sauces both really stand out (even if the food feels slightly dated there too).  If Joel Robuchon is one you have been wanting to try for a long time, I would say that it is worth a try though I would opt for one of their less expensive menus.If you are just looking for a really good French restaurant, I would suggest L'atelier de Joel Robuchon next door, which serves French cuisine very much inspired by classic French dishes but also with a lighter, more vibrant, more contemporary, and more creative style.Joel Robuchon is located in the MGM Grand.  Like other major hotels and casinos on The Strip, the MGM Grand offers both complimentary valet and self parking.Our awesome butler at the Skylofts got us last minute reservations here on Valentine's Day weekend.  Joel Robuchon has been on our list of restaurants to try and it did not disappoint, this is fine dining at its best :)Ambiance: 5 stars, the decor is classy, full of dark purple plush sofas and chandeliers with orchids everywhere.  It's very romantic :)Service: 5 stars, from start to finish the wait staff was on hand and was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menuFood:-Bread Cart: OMG this bread trolley...I can just eat from this and this alone.  There are dozens of selections from bacon bread, classic baguettes, cheese bread etc. Go for the bacon bread!-Amuse bouche: a cold beet concoction that was supposed to wake up your pallet; it actually did! -First course: Spicy Lobster with caviar, this dish was decadent and the lobster was so fresh and juicy! They also put real 24k gold flakes in there...lol..fancy fancy.                     Pumpkin soup: tiny portion but it was flavorful-Second course: Beef cheeks: Tender and delicious, and the whipped potatoes they served with it was so good!!                    Pork with truffles: This dish was a tad salty -Dessert: Their dessert cart was out of this world.  If you like sweets you will NOT be disappointed!  I highly recommend the dark chocolate truffles, the macaroons...actually just try anything that catches your eye hahaOverall: 5 stars!  The price for the 3 course was $169, we both had the 3 course with some wine and our dinner bill was around $500.  It was worth every penny though! The price for the 16 course was over $400 a person, however, the older couple next to us had the 16 course and they assured us it was divine.  We will probably try that next time for a special occasion.Location: In the MGM Grand next to KA.  I heard if you are staying at another hotel you can arrange for a gold limo to come pick you up in case you want to feel like a baller :)The 16 course tasting menu was "Heaven on Earth"! My wife and I were felt taken care from beginning to end.  The entire Joel Robuchon experience began with the complimentary limo ride from our Hotel.  As you depart your limo to the private entrance of  "The Mansion" at MGM, you are greeted by several members of the staff.  The first thing you notice is the attention to detail.  One staff member's responsibility is to escort you as you travel from The Mansion through the secluded entrance of the hotel to Joel Robuchon.  There are nice "handoffs" between members of their staff, so you always feel like you're being taken care of. We had a 6:00pm reservation, and when we arrived we were seated immediately.  When I had made my reservation, I had indicated that we were celebrating my Wife's birthday and I requested a private corner table.  To my splendid surprise, they were able to accommodate and we were seated in one of the dining rooms off to the side of the main dining room.  The decor was very beautiful!  There were ivy plants growing along the tall wall and a large bed of flowers. Now...on to the food. I highly recommend the 16 course tasting menu.  The nice thing to note about this fine establishment is that not everyone in your party needs to order the same thing.  My wife knew she could not get through 16 courses, so she opted for the 6 course a la carte menu (still $195).  I, on the other hand, selected the 16 course tasting menu.  At $395, this is by far the most expensive meal I have ever paid for, but then again how often do you get the chance to dine at one of the most renowned restaurants in the world.  Every single dish was done to perfection.  I have to say that the staff was very attentive and my wife and I never felt that they were eyeing us like hawks.  They were not intrusive at all (unlike what some reviewers have mentioned).  I am actually glad that our reservations were early because if you choose the 16 course menu, you will be there for a while.  From the amuse bouche, to the elaborate bread cart, to the courses themselves, and the desserts at the end, I have to say there is not a single thing I can complain about.  In fact, because I had mentioned it was my wife's birthday when I made the reservation, they even came out with a cake and candle for her!  We didn't get the entire cake, but they gave us 2 slices (on the house)!When we completed our dining experience, we were escorted back through the hotel to The Mansion where we had entered and into the limo back to our hotel. Bottom line:  most expensive meal I have ever had, but well worth every penny!Take advantage of the limo service. It was a fun (and safe) way of enjoying the experience. We started with a bottle of champagne on the way, and when we arrived at MGM, we were dropped off at the Mansion through a private entrance, escorted all the way to the hostess stand. Greeted immediately and seated in the most elegant dining room right next to the fireplace. The décor and color scheme was beautiful. Loved the Asian inspired uniforms as well. Not knowing if I'd be able to make it through the Sixteen Course Degustation Menu, I opted to try the Six Course Prixe Fixe Menu. L'Amuse-boucheBeet Velouté with Burrata***Une EntréeL'Œuf de Poule mollet et friand, légèreté au fin Comte et  Iberico de Bellota**Une Soupe(We did salad instead)LArtichaut Violet***Deux Plats au choixLe Black Cod, with a yuzu daikon velvet pureeLa Langoustine, Truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage***Fromage ***Dessert Le Rose FleuriI won't get into detail about every single dish, but  I have to say L'Œuf de Poule was by far my favorite. Sampling off the Cheese Trolley, Camembert and Compte were fantastic. The Bread Trolley. THAT BUTTER! Imported from Brittany, can I get a take home gallon of that? Dessert Trolley. Not gonna lie. By the time this came around, things were starting to be a little blurry. I had enjoyed my wine pairing, maybe a little too much. I highly suggest doing to pairing, the wines were fantastic. The take home gift of Pound Cake was a nice treasure to wake up to the next morning with my coffee. I truly enjoyed my meal, from what I remember.My husband wished me a happy 10th Anniversay and rattled off "Oh, by the way, we have a reservation for Joel Robuchon tonight at 9:30." Huh? What? A few hours later we were pulling up to MGM Grand's valet.Upon arriving to the restaurant, the hostess asked that we wait in the lounge while they prepare our table. A gentleman came by and asked if we'd like Champagne while we wait. Why not? Ten years of marriage deserves a toast. Little did we know, those two glasses of champagne were $29 each. Sneaky. Our table was in the garden, flowers and vines were all around. The tables had teal runners, white napkins tied with teal ribbon. This shade was nearly identical to the colors I used for my wedding. Pure coincidence, but it was a lovely nod to our memorable day. The menu was presented and we were given time to peruse it. It's overwhelming. There is the 16 course tasting menu, which is mighty tempting, an a la carte menu and several prix-fixe options. We opted for the prixe-fixe that offered two appetizers, main course and dessert ($198 per person). You choose your dishes from a varied selection. We each chose a cold and hot appetizer, entree and dessert; we felt this was the best way to sample as much of the menu as possible without gorging ourselves or breaking the bank. You're given a choice of flat or sparkling water ($10 per bottle of Evian). We also selected a half bottle Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc ($35) and then our feast was underway. We began with a Split Pea Amuse Bouche, it has marshmallows (savory, not sweet) pistachios and another tasty bite I cannot recall. I've heard tales of the bread cart, but I hadn't imagined this glorious nirvana with more than a dozen options. We had about five rounds of bread. Yes, seriously. It was complete carbicide. We loved every minute. My final meal will include their bread cart. No question. They also hand churn butter; there's a lovely presentation, and the olive oil is divine. Don't miss the croissants! They were so fabulous, I now want to visit France. Next, were the cold appetizers: asparagus with orange vinaigrette and sea urchin, and king crab salad.  Then, the warm appetizers: Crispy soft boiled egg in light comte cheese sauce with Iberico de Bellota ham, our favorite dish. Stellar. And truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage ($35 supplement), it was tasty, but not worth the upcharge. Our entree selections included, suckling pig prepared three ways: braised shoulder, chop and chorizo cannelloni ($30 supplement) and braised beef cheeks in eggplant and the most delicious mashed potatoes in existence. We also tacked on a cheese course from the trolley ($30), there were plenty of soft and hard cheese to choose from. We favor hard cheeses, but did try one soft cheese that was described as warm fondue, rings of Spruce tree are wrapped around the young cheese to impart flavor and vessel for transport. We agreed it was awful, thankfully the hard cheeses and the Roquefort did not disappoint. And finally, dessert! Frank had the chocolate soufflé ($15 supplement), it was outstanding. I had a raspberry mascarpone something or another. It had the most concentrated raspberry flavor imaginable. In addition to dessert, you're given the opportunity to select treats from the Mignardises trolley. I refer to this as the Willy Wonka experience. There must have been a hundred different items to choose from, we only chose a handful because we were beyond stuffed. The tirimisu was delicious and I've never liked creme brulee until now. With the check, we were given a parting gift: a citrus pound cake, and photo book. It was a huge splurge, but a fantastic experience. My expectations were incredibly high for a restaurant of this caliber. It is the first and only 3 Star Michelin Guide Winner in Las Vegas. We have some prime choices, but Joel Robuchon is definitely the upper echelon of dining.Not only is the decor beautiful, but the service and food is jaw dropping.  Champagne is brought to start....ummm yes!!! Girl loves rose! You can create your own courses or prix fixe.First, the bread cart! A large cart filled with an assortment of bread is brought to your table.  You get to make your own bread basket...plan ahead my lady friends, I definitely didn't go rocking a leger that night...Next the courses start. Food is rich, but portions are small...so they kind of balance each other out. They do have dishes that are on the healthy side if that's what you are looking for.Dessert, a large dessert cart is brought table side.  A cake stand is placed on your table and you just pick as many mini desserts as you like.  The detail is beautiful, they look so cute you almost don't want to eat them! Annnndddd then....yes I was a glutton that night, my regular dessert came. Chocolate soufflé, so airy and light(haha not really though).Lastly, another large cart full of fresh herbs is brought table side where you make your own pot of fresh tea.  So many different types of mint. The experience alone is worth the visitI can finally cross this place off my bucket list. It's been on there since I saw it profiled on a Travel Channel show more than a decade ago. It's a formal space that's fit for any special occasion -- like my birthday. Seating is comfortable, especially if you can get one of the corner booths. The decor is ornate in an old world sort of way. I felt like I was dining at my grandmother's place in the sense of its formality (minus the plastic covering that was on her furniture). Dishes are all a work of art. Everything is meticulously placed and plated. Plates and bowls are unique to most dishes and compliment the aesthetic of the food. The bread cart is as amazing as everyone says. I wasn't shy about selecting a few. The bacon bread, brioche with gruyere, and mini croissant were standouts. The separate cart for the butter is nearly as impressive with its tower of rich, creamy butter. Even that is beautifully presented as it's carved and plated table side in an "O" shape and finished with a touch of salt.Between the two of us, my wife and I shared three appetizers. The $26 supplement for the mushroom  and veal ravioli was steep, but we reveled in every amazing bite. The Alaskan king crab salad was beautifully plated and a forkful of crab, avocado, tomato with olive oil with each bite proved to be light, slightly acidic, delicate, and refreshing. The asparagus veloute that followed was velvety smooth.The first entree to arrive was a bowl with roasted lobster, chestnuts, asparagus in a shellfish jus. It was an interesting dish with bold, earthy flavors. A rich and hearty dish perfect for the chilly weather. The grilled rib eye plate that followed was almost like a parody of high-end, fine dining restaurant dishes with it's minuscule portions. The two slices of beef were small, but at least they were excellent cuts of tender, well seasoned beef. The addition of Robuchon's famous butter-laden potato puree lived up to the hype. The final entree -- roasted veal chops with thin mushroom ravioli -- was one of my favorites. The sweetbreads that accompanied it were like tiny, crispy croutons that enhanced the savoriness of the dish while adding a contrast in textures.For dessert we opted for the chocolate soufflé -- a perfect example of restrained sweetness and the perfect balance of bitterness. Raised high above the ramekin, it was an impressive sight that eventually collapsed after the addition of ice cream. There was no need to reinvent this classic dish as their execution was as good as any I've experienced.When dining here you always have to save room for the mignardises cart. My wife declined their offer of a birthday cake when making our reservation (that's a $30 supplement, I believe) so they brought out a pre-selected plate of mignardises. Which I was perfectly happy with. The choices on the cart are plentiful and I would have be too indecisive to select. I made short work of that plate and they brought the cart around to offer more. The lady bug -- a chocolate mousse tart -- was the best of the bunch. Our server also recommended the tiramisu and creme brûlée. Both were quickly brought out from the kitchen. Served in shot glass-sized glasses, the tiramisu was a beautifully layered, creamy rendition and the creme brûlée was equally amazing.While it is an expensive restaurant, if you have the funds it's worth experiencing at least once.A once in a lifetime meal experience...Eric R. asked me to pick one restaurant I had always wanted to try since I moved to Vegas 8 years ago.  Joel Robuchon was at the top of my long-term bookmark list, and he told me to make a reservation.We missed out on the golden limo by one month as that service was discontinued - bummer!  We were seated in a corner booth, with a deep purple hue.  The restaurant is very intimate and from our corner we could see everything, including the private room through the window with a living wall.We had several servers, one for drinks and desserts, one for taking our order, and one for breads and savory dishes.  We learned that most of the staff has worked there for over a decade together as a team.  I had a glass of Veuve Cliquot Brut and Eric R. had off-dry Riesling Kabinett.Eric R and I opted for the menu that included a choice of appetizer and entree, and also included the amuse bouche, bread cart, and mignardises cart.  We tried several breads accompanied with the whipped butter and sea salt and Spanish olive oil.  I tried the saffron brioche, olive baguette, and gruyere roll to start.  The amuse bouche was a strawberry gazpacho with sheep's milk cheese, balsamic and pistachio.  It was very refreshing.For appetizers, Eric R got the caviar atop salmon tartare with saffron and coriander crisps (for a supplement).  I began with the sea urchin and langoustine medallions in seaweed gelee and pureed cauliflower.  For entree, Eric R. ordered the roasted lobster with morels and asparagus in shellfish jus, and I got the caramelized black cod in Malabar pepper sauce with bok choy and freeze-dried lobster roe.  The entrees were accompanied by Robuchon's supposedly famous whipped potatoes.  Now I like potatoes but Eric R. doesn't.  We both tried them and both agreed they tasted like paste, that you may tile a floor with perhaps?  It was really a weird consistency and flavor, so that was yucky...at least that just came with the meal and wasn't our choice.For dessert, we went wild on the mignardises cart.  I had yuzu truffle, pecan dark chocolate, coconut eclair, hazelnut macaron, and lemon meringue.  Eric R. got blackberry opera cake pecan dark chocolate, strawberry pistachio tart, strawberry margarita gelee, blueberry white chocolate cake, and a made-to-order mini creme brulee.We finished the meal with a pot of gyokuro green tea.  It was a wonderful experience in a beautiful ambiance.  At the end of our experience, I was given a lemon pound cake as a parting gift.  I think it is a great place for a special occasion.Joel Robuchon perfectly embodies the essence of the ultra-ostentatious city of Las Vegas in all its sinfully delicious glory. The extravagant décor will leave you breathless--as will the bill at the end of the meal.. but let's worry about that later, shall we? We were guided by the hostess into a gorgeous "garden" with a moss wall and beautifully fragrant, vibrant flowers. From our seats, we could see the enormous chandelier in the central dining room. I highly recommend requesting this table because it was absolutely stunning! Pretty sure even the Italian Mafia seated next to us were impressed by the scenery. We debated between 5-course Menu A ($250) or 16-course degustation ($445), but ultimately decided on Menu A with multiple supplements. Throughout the evening, the birthday boy and I played a game to compare whose dish was better. My choices slightly edged out his, but there's no surprise there. *insert princess emoji*.  For the sake of brevity, I'll just recommend the winning dishes:Cold Appetizers: L'Oursin- Sea Urchin with langoustineHot Appetizers:La Langoustine- Truffled Langoustine Ravioli with foie gras sauce (AMAZING! Suppl. $35)Main Courses:Le Spaghetti- Spaghetti with a soft boiled egg, uni, caviar (best dish, hands down; Suppl. $60)La Langouste- Lobster with lemongrass emulsionDesserts:La Sphere- Lemon shaped-sugar sphere filled with lemon sorbetLa Chocolate- Black forest cake (CUTEST. DESSERT. EVER. Picturesque)The bread cart is spectacular, but that dessert cart is simply DIVINE. Desserts so adorable that even the most apathetic sociopaths would squeal with joy. Although the total bill came out to a whopping $825 with tax and tip, I'd say the entire experience was worth the hefty price tag.  It's unlikely I'd return because it was almost too rich to enjoy repeatedly, but for someone truly special (such as yourself, duh) there's no better way to celebrate. Nothing says "I love you" quite like foie gras, black truffle, and caviar. Except for.. ah, nevermind. Best girlfriend award or what?For our 10th wedding anniversary we decided to go all out and dine at Joel Robuchon at the MGM Grand. Thanks to the yelp reviews, we knew to book their complimentary gold limo in advance and got one of the three pickup services of the evening. We were taken to the private gated entrance to the MGM mansion with $5000 a night villas (who knew?). Then led through the mansion and high stakes poker tables to the restaurant in the casino.The meal: You do not have to order the degustation 16 course meal. Trust me on this. Not only do they offer an extensive bread cart with as much as you desire with honestly the best butter we have ever had (see pic) you do not have to order dessert as there is an included sweets cart with whatever you want. I ordered the lobster ravioli for the appetizer and pork for my entree. Both hands down the best on the menu. The pork was so tender like cutting into a rib eye- the ravioli has been a staple on the menu since day one and you'll see why. My husband  ordered the chilled lobster, seared foie gras and sea bass along with the cheese cart for dessert since he's not a chocolate fan. One of the best meals of our lives and we've been to French Laundry in Yountville twice. The service: this is where we only gave four out of five stars. The waiters were fantastic but again having seen the synchrony and service at French Laundry it's hard to compare. Special note: the chef came out to chat a bit during dessert so that was a nice personal touch. Would definitely return again.

I had a coupon for another place that apparently closed, so we wound up here.  Oops.  We thought other names for the place might be:  China Minimum.  China Don't.  China Ridden Hard And Put Away Wet.The service was nice enough but nothing else was.  The lipstick on the spoon that came with my daughter's egg drop soup pretty much set the tone.  The veggie chow fun and the veggie fried rice were sub-unremarkable.  The baby corn was overly large (we called it toddler corn) and had a musty flavor.  Ug.  The chow fun tasted mostly of soy sauce.  The veggie fried rice was OK.  Oh, we started with crab puffs.  They were overly oily and had no crab flavor.Just call it China Don't and leave it at that.

Review Text :
My God que les serveuses (et les clientes !) sont belles dans ce resto ! Je sais qu'on va manger dans un restaurant d'abord et avant tout pour la qualité de la bouffe et l'ambiance, mais dans ce cas-ci, ce n'est pas compliqué, on se croirait dans un lounge select géré par une agence de mannequins. Je suis allé manger là avec un ami en visite et je crois qu'il tombait amoureux d'une nouvelle fille à toutes les 30 secondes.Mais venons-en à la bouffe, puisque cela a une grande importance, après tout. De ce côté-là, aucune déception, c'était excellent, la viande juste à point, les légumes l'accompagnant offraient une bonne balance. Les prix sont plus élevés que la moyenne des restos sur cette rue, par contre les femmes mangent gratuitement certains soirs de la semaine (mardi et jeudi, je crois). Pas sûr que j'ai bien compris cette promotion, par contre. Comme disait mon ami, si c'est vraiment complètement gratuit pour les femmes, où sont les pauvres ? Tous les clients semblent être plutôt aisés, alors que tout le monde sait que la gratuité attire normalement une clientèle moins riche (ce qui est tout à fait normal). Bref, à ce sujet, je me dois de pousser la recherche un peu plus.

Restaurant name  Two Hippies Magic Mushroom Burgers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
So I'm usually not one for the whole pothead marketing scheme, which we've all seen many a Cheba Hut try to pull off, but Two Hippies is doing it right.  The biggest difference is that their food is actually worth eating when you don't have the munchies.  The place is tiny but they've given you a place or two to sit down.  It is filled with all of the psychedelics that you would expect and that you can think of.  But remember this place is all about the goods.  The Magic Mushroom Burger is a MUST if you like shrooms at all...the combination with the steak burger, cheese and "Liquid Sunshine Sauce" puts a taste in your mouth that is honestly a little surreal. I was lucky enough to score my burger, fries and coke for a 5 spot flat.  They also have some very special brownies that are a tasty treat after you've put down the goods.  But they are quick to let you know..."Don't Tell ANYONE Where You Bought Them."   They've just extended their hours to 9pm so stop by for lunch or dinner and I promise you'll get rocked.I was slightly disappointed with my Magic Mushroom Burger when I just finally tried Two Hippies' flagship burger after reading about the sober, blown minds of other Yelpers. But as I got more into the "special" sauce (probably shouldn't ask any questions about it), reveled in the quality ingredients, and remembered that I just paid 5 dollars event for a large burger, giant sack of fries, and can of sod-e pop I started falling in love with the place.It and the whole strip of stores there have a definite time warp effect if you are there around lunch time. The kooky yet wholesome collection of stores, mix of intentional and unintentional nostalgic decor, genuinely friendly store owners, and time-is-not-of-the-essence attitude of the patrons throw me back to my feel-good childhood going to pizza parlors and mom and pop stores in Moon Valley. It has a near perfect blend of Americana in the stores there: Burger Shack, Barber Shop, Pizza Parlor, Head Shop, Motorcycle Repair, and the soon-to-be New Orleans Coffee and Balloons(???). (Well maybe I'll have to hold off judgment until that last establishment finally opens, but you can bet I'll be there on opening day to figure out what the hell coffee, balloons, and New Orleans have to do with each other in the same shop.)Two Hippies seems to be run by an actual Mom and Pop who are actually interested in learning the name and story of everyone who walks in and making sure they had a good meal. Meals then come in sack form and are difficultly eaten on dense collections of bar stools inside or outside next to a bar that is too high even for a tall guy like me to eat from. But the whole action of kicking it on a patio bar stool while eating a burger mid-air out of a wrapper just adds to the feel and will eventually evoke a Jules Winnfield impersonation, quoting, "Uummmm, that's a tasty burger!"I feel like now have our "Big Kahuna" burger establishment in central Phoenix. It's not as refined and awesome as Delux or Fez, or as high quality as Welcome Diner, but its an overdue innovation for a quick, cheap sack lunch.But keep in mind the area still can be pretty seedy even at lunch time. There is quite a few homeless people roaming around at all times, usually including the war veteran guy in a wheelchair with only a few teeth left that likes to wear wife beaters and direct traffic. I also got to hear a long and drawn out "bitch needs to gimme ma money" conversation when I was eating on the patio.My only other complaint is that part of their decorations is a vintage cabinet Ms. Pac-Man machine that is supposedly in working order that they are just using as a table to hold flavored candy sticks and other crap. It's a travesty. They need to fire that baby up.I hate soggy fries. The rest of my household gobbled them up, but unless I get a good crunch as I bite into the potato goodness, I'll pass.That being said, the burgers at Two Hippies are good enough to keep a recovering vegetarian such as myself coming back.We went on a Saturday afternoon and the place had a steady coming-and-going of families, couples, dirty hippies and assorted other motley folk coming through the door. The place is tiny so most of us waited outside and watched the homeless pass by as we waited for our food. Grabbed our brown bag and everyone else in my party munched on fries the whole way home.. I sipped on my cream soda in an attempt to get the mushy-undercooked potato taste out of my mouth.I ordered the daily special, a green chile burger. Man-o-man... The burger was topped in a whole, perfectly-roasted green chile which added a nice bite to the special sauce. The bun was perfectly toasted and the fixin's perfectly piled (there's nothing worse than taking the first bite of a burger and having the toppings squeeze out the other end).. The beef was fantastic quality and the patty was a good size, but not one of those we'll-give-you-a-huge-burger-so-your-gut-hurts-afterward burgers.The signature magic mushroom burger looked great, as well. We had tried to go earlier in the week around dinnertime, but the sign on the front and back door says they close at 4 p.m. and they were definitely closed the evening we tried to go. I believe they're also closed on Sunday, so don't try to sneak in here instead of going to church.Hippies scare me.     So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy, which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.It was all for nothing. No hippies around, just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6" could easily eat off of them.  Anyways for $5 flat, you get a kick ass burger, a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries, and a can of soda.   It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say "it's organic, don't panic".  Jerry's dead, but this place lives on.  Thanks hippies!Barack Obama ate here!  That's right BITCH, the next Pressy had a burger here.  This from the owners mouth.At any rate, man did I want to LOVE this place, unfortunately my burger was over cooked.  The seasoning was great so I think it was just my bad luck.  I will go back.  But here's the real reason to eat here, it's Fucking CHEAP!  $5 get's you a burger, fries and a coke!  You can't beat that!So, i've worked at two yummy burger places (Delux and Fez), so I think I know a good burger when I'm presented with one.  Two Hippies is yummy, nothing fancy, nothing incredible, but what do you expect for $5? I got yummy seasoned fries (which were soggy, but the irony is I LOVE soggy french fries!), and the burger had yummy carmelized onions, which is Delux's secret!The best surprise was the owner, his customer service was incredibly great! Best I've had in a long time. SUPER nice guy, and even gave my fiance a free soda! Gotta luv that Dark Cherry pop!Go, it's cute and fun!!Mmmm Magic Mushrooms... *drool*I've been to this place twice.  Once with a buddy and once with the wife.  I usually test a place with my buddy before I deem it wife-worthy, and believe me... it is WIFE-WORTHY!  Everything is fresh according to Mrs. Hippy.  I found that statement a bit odd after seeing an empty box of frozen burger patties. Not that I care!  Those things are bad ass!  They also make their own thousand-island dressing for the mushroom burger and its phenomenal!Trip #1: I ordered the Jalapeno Burger, Fries, and a can of soda. Total price was $5 even. The burger was surprisingly unmatched, for the price.  I mean it is no Island's burger, but it is very tasty and inexpensive. The fries are those crinkle cut ones like you used to get in elementary school for lunch.  Fat, juicy, and crispy. The soda was... well... a can of soda.Trip #2: I ordered the Magic Mushroom Burger, Fries, and a can of soda. Total price, again, was $5 even. I'm beginning to like this! The burger had tons of Swiss cheese and mushrooms on it.  A dabble of thousand island (which was rich and creamy) completed this masterpiece. The fries, same. The soda, same.I preferred the jalapeno burger, just because that's how I roll.  I like jalapeno burgers.  If you are a Swiss n' mushroom burger person, I'm sure you will find that this burger is unbeatable.Two Hippies is a great little no brainer kind of placed to eat. Incredibly small and ran incredibly well, be prepared to squeeze your way in and out .   They have great specials and the price is definitely right. For 5.00 you have lunch and maybe a bit of an experience as well.   Today with kids in tow , the hubby and I had Guacamole Burger, Fries, Onion Rings and A super yummo  Mushroom Burger.  The mushroom burger was so good , love the mushrooms, cheese and the bun really worked. I am so glad they put some thought into the bread. The Guacamole was not what I envisioned  with thick guac, it had runny stuff that frightened me.  The kiddettes had sliders , so cute with their tiny little buns, the burgers not the kids.  We all adored the fries they just really work with the burgers, the seasoning is "lawrey seasonish " but what the hey it was good stuff.   Pretty fast service for  a line out the door on a Saturday afternoon , it was already past one and people were hungry , big orders in and out and lots of people !  They have service down you walk up order they write it on a lunch bag and wham it comes out in about 10 -15 minutes. They don't mess with  a soda fountain  so you have to be okay with drinks out of the can. It kind of gives it a "Whacka-whacka"  old school feel! For those of you young yelpers , yes we didn't have an endless soda fountain back when I was a kid. The parking really sucks , it is tough to get in and tough to get out I literally thought we were going to be in one of those chinese puzzles where you have to move the pieces  every which way to work .  People are very serious about getting in there !This area is teaming with unique options and real honest to goodness bargains. Stop by Magic Mushroom and get a burger, fries and a can of soda for $5 even. The owners start early in the morning to grind the meat fresh ever day that goes into the burgers, now that's some serious attention to detail. If available, and you're really hungry, try the Fat Ass ($7.50). This burger is just as much fun ordering, as it is eating. A couple of beef patties with all the fixings, plus bacon on a deliciously soft bun, sides of fries, onion rings and 2 sodas, whew! Go Fat Ass! Inside Two Hippies there's enough tie-dyed, flower child kitsch packed into this place to transport you to the summer of love in one step through the door. Look out Brady's, there's a new bunch in town!Five bucks.  A burger, fries and can of pop.  How can you go wrong?I had the Guac burger.  It's the reason I took a star away.  The burger itself was great, but the guac?  Notsomuch.  They do have a good array of different toppings to choose from.  The fries were shoestring-cut and had a spiced salt sprinkled on them.  It was a good-sized serving.  I love a can of pop!  They have Shasta, which is two thumbs up for me.  It doesn't have NutraSweet in the diet, but Splenda.  Hooray!Getting out of this place is a bitch so here's my secret: Go out the back way, through the car wash to get to 7th Street.  Traffic on Indian School, right at the 7th Street light, sucks moose balls.Holy cow! This is NOT a "where's the beef?" burger! And, they are hand-formed, saw the guy molding patties with my own eyes!!The greasy, heart-attack-in-a-bag $5 special is not for the faint hearted.The green chile delivered the heat. Couldn't even finish my fries!I WILL be back, but I'm definitely going to have to ration myself! Good thing it's not on my way home from work!!My family has a motto: "Pot just makes me tired and hungry; and I'm already tired and hungry." For some of the family this means "Say no to drugs"; for others it means harder stuff is where it's at; for me it means "I need a burger and a nap."Cue the hippies. Two Hippies served me up a real burger. Like a REAL one! you know curvy like I like em; not flat. The fries came in a paper bag so that no one can claim they had no idea it was bad for them and sue. The bad is clear by the time you take a seat...grease may be my favourite foodI am not going to be the only one not to mention that you get a burger, fries and can of soda (pop for Thomas S and the people of his homeland and surrounding areas--ps they say pop because they would just say soda funny.) for $5!! Way better than fast food for cheaper. I will now end this review because I am tired...and hungry...I've had burgers that cost twice as much with half the taste.  That's what my dad said about his Mushroom Burger.  This must be one of the best values in town and it actually tastes good.  Well, my hamburger has been a little overdone more than once.  But I think that charred flavor just makes it seem like I'm at a family cookout.  The seasoning on the fries is great and I had to stop myself from shoveling them in my mouth.  If you want to eat there, find the picnic tables at the back.  Sure, it's like eating in a parking lot, but you are guaranteed to have hot fries.  CASH ONLY.  They do have an ATM inside.The story of two hippies and finally, a great idea.In a land filled with broken dreams and grumbling tummies, two hippies met while attending a Phish concert. Recognizing each other as hippies by their standard issue, Grateful Dead t-shirts, big daddy; as he preferred to be called, introduced himself to Little "T". In this moment, the clouds parted while angels played their harpsichords and trumpets from a Farmhouse. "Hey, you like burgers?" Little "T" asked big daddy. "Hhhehheehee, of course. You ever seen the northern lights?" asked big daddy.... fast forward seven years ...  Little "T" finally had a great idea. "Hey big daddy, wouldn't it be cool if there was a burger shop where all the hungry people could come and eat a burger, fries, and a drink for just a dollar?" "No way man, burgers are like heaven and people would pay like, $10 for an awesome burger, fries, and a drink." he replied.After years of debating and three failed marriages between the both of them, "T" and daddy settled on $5 as a great price for burger, fries and a drink. Today, you can find this $5 meal in Central Phoenix 365 days a year, except Sundays, holidays, between the hours of 8pm and 11am, or from 4:20 to 4:21 -- hippies gotta sleep; and, you know... ;-)Stop in for lunch one day (or dinner), order up their daily special, their house bacon cheese burger, or even a hot dog. While considering your options, browse the toppings list such as, fresh jalapenos, roasted hatch chili, caramelized onions, onion rings, house made habanero ketchup, and more. Side note to all you spicy food extraordinaires, the habanero ketchup is down-right fantastic. In fact, I think this ketchup steals the show. While greasy burger spots aren't on the normal "bucket list", if you love spicy food and in some weird way make a list of all the places you wish you could try before you die, you NEED to add this to the list. I almost wish I could buy a batch of this stuff to take home - OMG that was spicy!Oh, the burger and steak cut fries aint bad either ;-) I ordered the bacon cheese burger, sans the tomato, add jalapenos and a side of that delish house made habanero ketchup. It was a burger like none other I've had!Happy Yelping Phoenix!

Review Text :
I finally made it to this Chompie's location... and just like the rest of the Chompie's I've been to, it goes to the category "Best Deli in AZ" - still not New York, and I think I may even prefer Goldberg's in Atlanta, but in Phoenix, Chompie's is the place!We were there for dinner and I did order one thing that I never ordered from Chompie's before... Sweet Potato Fries!  Yes, Chompie's has pretty good sweet potato fries - yay!  I filled up on pickles and I also had a salad and a scoop of their whitefish salad.  (I probably would not order that again).  Stick with knishes, bagels, sandwiches, and even omelettes - you'll be pleased.  Oh - and I cannot forget their soups... especially matzah ball and kreplach - yummy!  And if you have a sweet tooth, there is PLENTY to choose from!Now I'm craving Chompie's again... I have to figure out which location is closest to my new digs!Oy ve iz mir!Not to be a kvetch....but I consider myself to be an expert on Jewish delis.  As a New Yorker from a predominantly Jewish area and married to a Jew, I've had more than my fair share of experiences at them.  My husband and I woke up this morning with a burning desire for a good bagel, corned beef on rye, and a knish.  So I schlepped all the way up to the PV Mall to get it.Ok, first of all, the decor is terribly schlocky.  Its kind of like the tourist trap Jewish deli you find in Times Square.  Its like a Disney version of a NY deli.  I take my number and head over to the cold case to get some drinks....of course they didn't have regular lemon Snapple (and why should they?  Its not like every deli, pizza place, and convenience store in NY carries it....) but they did have Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray which is always a welcome sight.  Another thing they had in the cold case which I found to be odd were jars of Nathan's pickles.  Nathan's, like the hot dog place.  I would imagine a Jewish deli would have Ba Tampte pickles....I didn't even know Nathan's made pickles!  It was a little lame to be honest.Anyways, I go up to the counter where there doesn't seem to be anyone working.  There was no organization to it.  So I waited.  And waited.  In New York, the deli is a finely tuned machine designed to move people quickly.  Chompie's? Eh, not so much.  When I finally did place my order, the guy who took it had a hard time punching it into the computer and asked me to repeat it several times.  Despite saying I wanted my bagel toasted several times I was given a cold, untoasted bagel.  I waited a little longer for my order to come up and went on my merry way.  Here is the breakdown of the food we ordered-Matzoh ball soup- Surprisingly good.  I have never had matzoh ball soup with carrots and celery...so much chazerei!  Just give me the matzoh ball! Although, I will admit, it was solid.  I wouldn't go all the way to Chompie's for it because I know that I can make it better in my own kitchen. Plain bagel "toasted" with cream cheese- Terrible.  The bottom of the bagel was entirely too thick and was very hard.  They didn't even cut it all the way through, probably because the crust is too thick! Corned beef on rye- Meh.  The corned beef wasn't very good, it wasn't corned enough.  If they make their own they didn't use a piece of brisket that was fatty enough.  The rye (which was not marble rye...) was lackluster.   It couldn't handle the corned beef, became soggy, and eventually fell apart.  The pickle it came with was the grossest thing I've ever seen.  And it was definitely a kosher dill, even though I asked for a half sour.  The potato salad was actually really good though.Knish- Terrible.  The knishes in my elementary school cafeteria were better than this.  First of all, the outer crust was way too flimsy.  It should have been much, much, thicker, especially considering the gargantuan size of the knish.  We essentially ate a large plate of mashed potatoes.  The potato inside itself was unremarkable.  Not only do I have this Jewish thing going on but I'm also Irish....I've never met a potato dish I didn't like.  Until today.  I didn't even finish my half of the knish. Now for the prices.  What's with this meshugas?  $2.29 for a bagel with cream cheese is a tad much.  In NY they run you about $1.35.  The corned beef sandwich was $12.50!  Now, I've paid that much for sandwiches in NY before but you get 2 lbs of meat and several layers of sandwich!  This was not a $12.50 sandwich.  I was also going to get us some whitefish salad to sample but at $15.99/lbs it wasn't happening.  Why anyone should schlep all this way, in this heat, schvitzing all over, for this dreck?  I don't know!Every time I go to Phoenix, I stop into Chompies at least once.They have a cool breakfast/lunchy deli theme. It would be like dressing up a hole in the wall ny deli.I usually get breakfast even at lunch time.The staff is normally friendly and inviting.The food options are plentiful. Anything you want from a NY Deli is here. They bake their own breads and make most everything in house. Chompies serves BIG oversized portions and I usually dont finish mine but will also try other peoples dishes when I'm there. order frsh squeezed OJ its the real deal.I was watching Man VS Food and he did a challange there and he couldnt do it. Its a dozen chopped sauteed beef brisket, latke potato cake topped with onions and cheese on a homemade bun thing(I forgot what they call it). sliders and they looked so good I'm gonna get those next time I'm there.Make sure to try any of the desserts. They display them nicely and eat it or take it home.mmmmmAnyways theres a couple of Chompies in Metro Phoenix/Scottsdale area and go to either one and you'll get some good grub!I was a little hesitant to come to Chompie's in a Sunday afternoon. Not sure what to expect. Anyways, wow. The place is jammed pack. Everyone is here. So I had their breakfast here before and wasn't that impressed. Today, I ordered their full hot pastrami sandwich on a Kaiser roll with a side of coleslaw. Goodness. So good. I love hot pastrami sandwiches when done right and they did it right. Nice a juicy with lots of flavor in every bite. Loved the Kaiser roll too. Very fresh and the roll just made the sandwich really good. The coleslaw was really good. Had a little bit of sweetness to it. I really enjoyed this meal. My wife was craving a salad. Really at a deli. Anyways, she ordered a Grilled Chicken Cesar's salad. It was a really big portion and she just gobbled up that salad. She really liked it. Didn't get to try it but looked really good. Our service was right on. We sat at our table and right away they brought us a small plate of dill pickles. Love dill and they were really good. Anyways, our server welcomed us right away a told us he would be right there in a minute. On the spot he was there takin our order. Water glasses were at our table fairly quickly and they had people filling up our glasses. Our food came out really quickly and our server was always checking on us even through it was really busy. I would have to say that we really enjoyed our meal here. Quick and efficient service with some really good food. We saw that dessert menu and was really temped, but maybe next time. Enjoy we sure did.

Review Text :
My first visit to Amelie's and I am a lifelong, hymn-singing devotee.  I knew I can expect quality goodies from the many reviews I read, but to try them in real time was another experience.  I went in after a late lunch with my sister (we saved our dessert space specifically for Amelies)  Stepping in, the insides were soooooo cute, just makes you want to stay in for a couple hours :)  All the desserts looked simply indulgent, and it was hard to select just 2-3 items.  I love tea cakes, but when I couldnt decide between the raspberry and lemon, the lovely lady said she would choose raspberry--as did I.  And Im glad I did because it was so light yet rich and flavorful.  Light because I didnt feel the need for milk with it :-D  I also got a Palmier (very crispy and buttery) and a cinnamon stick.  I chose smaller and lighter things because I had a big lunch.  I will be back to sample everything else, and more time on my hands.The service was excellent, even with a line behind me, the person behind the counter patiently waited while I selected.  Everyone was nice, helpful and fast.I just realized that I have not reviewed Amelie's - one of my favorite-est bakeries around.Let me just tell you about my love affair with this French bakery. 1) They have salted caramel brownies. Yup, you read it correctly. Absolutely delectable salty/sweet/chocolately goodness. It will certainly give you a toothache and you'll appreciate it.2) This place is open 24 hours. Holla! 3) The croissants. Oh momma likes. My personal fave is the strawberry cream cheese, but the chocolate will do in a pinch, too.4) Great coffee. The kind of coffee that you enjoy outside the states,. No Folgers, here, friends.5) Free WiFi! Woot!6) The all around lovely atmosphere. Amelie's is just a cozy, breath of fresh air for me. The perfect spot to park with a laptop or stuff my face with umpteen pastries.On a side note, I haven't tried Amelie's lunchy food yet, but I'm looking forward to it. Amelie's makes me (almost) love the French - it's THAT good.Hard to review Amelie's. It's so awesome, unique, good for CLT, comfy, all around kick ass, that I gotta go after the nits. Which are:Table immediately inside the door so that would-be lunchers break left and right, confused, and have to spend a sec asking "are you in line?" More than occasional space cadet order takersPrice inflexibility (adding things to, say, a lunch tartine can run you upwards of 2 bucks, if they let you do it at all)But, I never leave here having spent less than $10, and my theory is that there's some sort of weird hypnosis that gorgeous case of pastries triggers. All the color and perfect chocolate swirls, perhaps... anyways, when I come to, I've got not only my coffee and sammich but also a baguette, cup of soup and tart tucked under my arm (well, in a box, anyway).Take it from an NYC pastry hunter - prices on tarts, cream puffs, macaroons, etc. are reasonable, darlings. A perfect eclair is an extensive and laborious process.The vegan soup is deeelish, as are their other choices (seems there's always a veg or vegan option, so yay!).And 24hrs? Quelle bonne idée!We stopped by here on the way home to satisfy my special lady wife's need for sweets after two stops indulging my own beer needs. i was surprised at the crowd just before 9 o'clock on a Thursday night. i really had not read anything about this place and had driven by countless times having no clue it even existed. The cluster of ooglers and droolers deciding what to order wasn't ideal, but some dude took our order and moved us along.  i just told him i wanted something chocolate and chocolate with some chocolate. Whatever he picked out was perfect. The chocolate mousse-stuff went nicely with my Abita Jockamo IPA and the latest episode of Big Brother. All in all, our order was like $13 for 2 little bites and two bigger treats. Thanks be to the Entertainment Book for $5 off, bringing the total to $8.6/8/12All that we tried from here were simply terrific!  If our next visit is just as great as our first, I'm sure I wouldn't have a problem bumping my rating up to five stars.  :)  So, why not give five stars outright?  I'd have to say it was due to my slight disappointment in the atmosphere...We came in and were immediately greeted by the cashier at the counter, which was situated right in front of the entrance and to the right of the pastry display cases.  The coffee preparation area is behind and to the right of the cashier.  All of this served to show just how busy the staff members were: the pastry chefs working in the back, who would come out to deliver fresh-baked goodies and refill the cases, the cashier taking orders at the counter, a couple of people manning the coffee area (preparing espressos, lattes, mochas, and French presses, just to name a few), and a few more going in and out of the kitchen preparing sandwiches and other items.  This gave the place a bistro feel.  I suppose I was expecting a little more laid-back and romantic cafe, with an in-house bakery in the back- I quickly got over it.  Amelie's is a patisserie with a cafe attached to it.  We sat ourselves at the set of love seat, chairs, and coffee table across from the cashier and the bakery's entrance, so for the most part of our meal, my views of the pastry cases and the rest of the cafe were blocked by lines of people ordering and paying at the cashier-- not conducive to a relaxing breakfast/brunch.  I kept wishing there was a wood panel screen between our table and the traffic of people to give us some privacy.  Since Mom and sis had no idea of what to order, I decided to start us out with some coffee and chocolate croissants.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA#HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA  Everyone wanted coffee, including me, but I also wanted to try AFB's mocha, so I ordered a large French press (serves 3 or 4) and a mocha latte.  I expected traditional style croissants, so AFB's slightly disappointed me presentation-wise, but as long as the pastries taste delicious, I don't mind, and these croissants were terrific, and they also kept well for the next two days through our vacay in FL.  Among the boxed pastries we took to go http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw#9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw, I really loved the eclairs, which also kept well.  I thoroughly enjoyed the bite through the outer bread layers to find the chocolate filling; It was amazingly creamy and light, yet not fluffy (I don't do fluffy), and the eclairs stayed fresh through numerous times of refrigeration and thaws.  My sis enjoyed her bites of one salted caramel brownie, but interestingly enough, didn't eat the rest of it, nor touch the second one.  They seemed very rich...  I also enjoyed the Napoleon's crunch and buttercream-textured custard filling, but for fear of clogged arteries, I think I'll stay away from now on.  :)As for the savory selections, sister and Mom absolutely LOVED the chicken salad sandwich!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw#TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw  Mom and  I really enjoyed the ham and gruyere tartine-- I loved the crunch of the toasted baguette and thought the saltiness of the cheese and ham paired well with the sweet-goodness of my mocha and croissant.Yes, we've all decided to make AFB our first stop from the airport on our trips back to the Queen City!p.s.  Amelie's is open 24/7!Amelie's. It's an absolute Charlotte staple, honorable mention to the salted caramel brownie, but some of the most apathetic service in town, in my opinion. I'm not too amped on going to Amelie's.....really at all. If you've never been, check it out. If you're visiting from out of town, it's a must. If you're into kitschy decor, by golly, what are you waiting for? If you're into good pastries, look elsewhere. When I first moved to Charlotte, we were all about this joint. Board games, open 24/7, ample seating (inside and in the atrium of the 28th Row), and plenty of caffeine for late-night work sessions. So why 2 stars? Apathy. The service is just abysmal and the product(s) tend to suffer the consequences as result. The trendy little kids behind the counter "go out of their way" to serve you and, dare I say, ask "who's next" in line. There are plenty of things right with Amelie's. Get some staff that actually KNOW the products, give them a little more love, and then put them in front of people. Every time I've visited, which has been sparse in the past few years, I've been in line with newbies. They should be swept off their feet as soon as they make eye contact with the staff. But, instead, I've seen them met with obligatory welcomes and blank stares. Upon our last visit, we went with some go-tos -- Vanilla eclair and the chocolate croissant. Both were kinda blah. Dry, had been sitting in the case for what tasted like a good two or three days, and aren't what they used to be. You know....as long as the salted caramel brownie stays the same, I'm a happy camper. I still love you, Amelie's. You'll always have a place in my Charlotte-loving heart, but your service is just less than desirable.I came here for a coworkers baby shower and could not have been more impressed with the space, the food, and the employees. If you've never been beyond the pastry case in the front of this location you are missing out. It extends so far back it's hard to believe. They have so many little nick-knacks to look at you'll never be bored.I also didn't realize you could rent the place out. Someone told me that it could hold a wedding party of 80! We only had the back rooms rented out for about 20 people and it was plenty of space. Amelie's provided quiche Lorraine which was wonderful, as well as a spinach quiche, their famous pastries, coffee, and orange juice. I was so impressed with their food I took some home to my husband, who took literally a bite out of everything because he couldn't decide what to eat.Back in June (or whenever the hell my second week of vacation was for the year), I went to go see my big sis in Charlotte.  When I was there, she kept telling me about this bakery I just had to try.  Nestled in the NoDa district (hipster central), we went to Amelie's, a 24 hour French bakery/hangout.Now, my sister is fluent in French, and I used to live (and cook!) there.  When it comes to all things French, I can be pretty critical of it (kind of like the same way I am with steaks).  So, we decided to go.  She had been before, and she enjoyed it- but told me there are times when the line can be out the door.  When you pull up, it looks like it is in a strip mall of warehouses (new or old, I have no idea).  When you walk in, you are what seems to be you immersed in pop culture.  I would like to think of it as if Andy Warhol designed the place.  There is a counter with all of the pastries and desserts, and a chalked menu of everything else.  I noticed the seating is interesting, as there are no two tables alike- and it seems there are as many couches as there are seats.  My first visit, I ordered the croque monsieur and a cream soda.  Sis got some kid sized stuff- I asked her if that was all she was getting?   We sat at one of the tables near the door.  As we were waiting, I kept getting the signature dirty looks.  If anyone wanted to start some shit, I was ready!The food then came out.  It was pretty decent, with the flavors of cheese and Dijon adding to it.  I scarfed it, and was wanting more.  But it being a French bakery and all (and the dirty looks I was getting), I decided to just have that.When I came back in town for Thanksgiving, I brought my best friend with me.  We decided to go back.  This time, it was him, my sister, my year old nephew, and myself.  This time, I was starving, and I was not going to hold back.  I ordered a croque monsieur again, and a ham sandwich with cheese.  My buddy got some  kind of sandwich, but I don't remember.   I remember at the time, we didn't get a number (for whatever reason), and then I realized everyone else did.  We had 3 sandwiches coming, they better not lose the order!We sat at a table in the back, with a couch and 2 chairs.  I was playing with my nephew as his face was covered in chocolate (sis got eclairs).  My sis took him outside for a few to get some air.  We were waiting a few, and then I thought I saw our food come out, and the runner you could tell was baffled, as there was no number.  She then ran another order of food, and then I got her attention- "I think those were our sandwiches".  The funny thing is, we never got a receipt either, so it was a matter of faith.  Our food then came out.This time, the croque was very flaky, and not like in a buttery flaky way, but like "god damn, I need water after every bite" flaky.  I washed it down with the other sandwich.  Thankfully the cream soda is sold in pints!It's cool that this place is open at all hours of the day and is pretty large, but I don't know- I can come here every so once in a while, but that gaffe was kind of a turn off.  All the cashier had to say it was for the big motherfucker in camo and a braves hat.  I can ASSURE I was the only one...Another thing that irked me was seeing the crème brulee was already bruleed.  The topping gets compromised after sitting there for 3 hours or more, and let's be honest, they aren't making crème brulees every 3 hours...  And if they are, I sincerely apologize.  But like a great cannoli, you fill the shell when you order it.But hey, what the hell would I know about French cuisine...The quality has fallin to the way side.   No more real butter cream, BUT  Grease Cream they buy in 5 gallon buckets ! !      Frozen   desserts defrosted,  STALE Brownies    this place has seen its hay day its over with Amelies,

So I was going to china chili for lunch and on the way I passed this purple square building with bbq graffed all over it, naturally I hit my e-brake and made a u-turn straight out of the movie bullit. The place is a hole but the people who cook there truly love bbq, I got the ribs and a pulled pork sandwich with some purple drink (grape for the white kids)  to wash it down with. The ribs were dope for sure, my pork sandwich was aight but didn't hold a candle to the ribs. I like this place allot there are some service issues, but  when I left the bbq master was outside he yelled "hot did you like the Q" I smiled and threw him some thumbs. (i guess you had to be there)BRING CASH!!  just wanted to get that out of the way.  I  didn't catch it when I was reading reviews so now you know. We will definitely be back to Smokehouse. Although not much for decor , this little building serves big flavor.We loved the Pull Pork , Brisket Sandwich, Fried Chicken and my new favorite , smoked corn . Delicious! We went about dinnertime and there was lots of room and pretty fast service.Word... that's best way I can say it... I've had better. I really had crazy high hopes for Stacy's. Pulling up to the former corner store, I could smell the smoke in the air and felt my hopes rise even further away from me. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but I knew I wanted it to be good. Walkin' in, I saw the "They love on YELP" sticker and was so glad. Stacy's is good and unfortunatly... he knows it. We looked over the sign and wasn't sure what to get. My mom ordered the small beef sandwich with onion rings. I started to order, but then stopped my self and was given a smart ass remark from the cashier. My bad... dang. Ummm let me get the large pork sandwich with sweet fries and small cole slaw and grape kool-aid. Our order came to nearly $20 For a simple lunch!!We waited and sat and heard some slimely businessmen talking about titties, cigars and cars... *shudder* overhearing their conversation made me regret being straight. gag. Our food was brought to our table and I was... underwhelmed. The fries looked limp and lifeless, like they were rememnts from the past lunch hour. not at all cruncy or flavorfull... besides the sugary cinammon sprinkled atop them. The sandwich was okay... but just okay. It reminded me of manwhich with extra liquid smoke. the cole slaw was uninspired (Who knew cole slaw needed inspiration?) It needed heavy doses of pepper and a kick of salt to be decent. The Kool-Aid was too sweet to drink and I wound up chugging a third of it before adding some water to it and then was able to ward off diabetic coma for that day. My mom liked her sandwich but didn't like that it was SOO small! She was really disappointed but liked the flavor and wanted more. She also liked her onion rings, I had a couple and they were good. I want to give it another go. Because so many people liked it, it has to be good... right?! It could have been a bad day or something, I'm really hoping it was. Because based off of my experience... best BBQ in the city?? Hardly!Now that Arizona has passed legislation making it illegal to:* Roll your "R's" in the word "Burrito";* Elide the "N" in "Jalapeño";* Accurately pronounce "Chipotle" and "Habenero", and * Greet anyone by saying "Hola!"I figured it was time to sort out what I'm going to do for a little spicy food when there aren't anymore places that will sell me a great taco or quesadilla (I'm safe with those words for my review, since the law was just signed, it's not in effect, yet:)Since Arizona is becoming Texas "Lite", I figure that "Q" will be a safe harbor (much like the British Virgin Islands have become a safe harbor for most of my money).With that in mind, I decided to get busy finding my little BBQ spots around the greater Dalla...er...Phoenix Area...yeah...the Valley of the Sun...that's the ticket!I've tried a few...I really liked the recently departed Kinfolks (he went back to Oakland...something about an inhospitable business climate, here...go figure).After sort of detoxing at squash today, I stopped off for a little lunch at Stacy's Smokehouse.Funny story about that...I've discovered that there is almost nothing more demoralizing to my squash opponents that taking a couple of pulls of Macallan 18 from my flask just before a squash match ("what, he thinks he's good enough to play me...drunk!!!!").If I beat them (and I do often enough) it really makes for great bragging rights...if I don't win...Hey, I'd had a couple of belts! :)Win/Win!Stacy's is in the old ammo bunker that used to house Turk's Fish and Chips (home of the best fish & chips in Arizona...but they're gone now so let's move on) and this isn't a location that really seems to be conducive to a successful business...(although this spot is certainly appropriately "divey").Nevertheless, they have a bunch of framed awards on their "look at me" wall, proclaiming them as the best of this and that...but that's what different opinions are for...to start fistfights:)And my opinion differs...I didn't actually think that my pulled pork was the best in town...I tried several things at Stacy's today...pulled pork, a couple of sauces, French fries, beans, fried pickles (hey!...I was hungry...playing squash with a buzz is hard work:), and while the food was good, fine, decent, OK...it wasn't transcendent.I like that they smoke their own meat (insert joke here) and make their own sauces, and all that, but the Q was just pretty average (just off the top of my head, you've got BobbyQ's and Scottsdale BBQ that will both put this place in the shade).But it wasn't down to Honey Bear's level...and it's miles ahead of Dickie's Pit (involuntary shudder).Give Stacy's a try...it certainly not bad Q, and we do all have to select authentic American food choices now...I know I'll be back...if someone else is buying:)3.5 stars...although I don't round up:)My hope is that once Arizona completes the Texasizanation process, that places like the Goode Co., and Drexler's and even Bryan's will move here to Housto...oop's, I mean Phoenix...give us more great Q choices...as long as they don't try to sell us anything with Chipotle's in it!Oh yeah...the emoticon's are back...be very afraid:-)

It was a dark and gloomy Sunday night in downtown Phoenix. It was 6:30 Pm. On any other day in this city the streets would be lit up with restaurants eagerly proclaiming "we're open! we're open! come on in! give us your money!" But not on Sundays. On Sundays everyone closes their doors and goes home. As invisible as magic, unicorns, and Mariah Carey's acting talent. It was Nathan's birthday, and Amanda B and I took it upon ourselves to devise a place suitable for a birthday dinner. You might as well have asked us to perform brain surgery with a screwdriver and a plunger."Two Hippies?""Closed.""That BBQ place you like?""Closed.""Um...there's a Pizza Hut---""Uh, no.""Sorry."Yeah. Guess which one I was in that exchange.Finally we came upon Mamma Mia's, and collectively griped at how we had forgotten our "freebie" chips from the Birthday pARTy. Thankfully, they were open, though you wouldn't have known it by the way the girl ushered us through the kitchen to the dining room.There are two types of people who order pizza. There are those who, when asked their preference, list all the toppings they like. And there are those who respond by listing all the things they don't like on pizza. With the latter option, everyone gathers around the menu and lists off what available toppings they wouldn't eat. Through the process of elimination, you pick from the available toppings and come with a democratically agreed upon pie.And that's how we decided on basil and fresh tomato slices. With a side order of meatballs."How many meatballs come in a side?" asked Nathan."Five.""That's perfect."At first I was skeptical. How is five perfect for a party of three people? Who taught you to do math, birthday boy? Big Brother?Thankfully I kept those thoughts to myself...I know, even I was impressed with myself.And I'm glad I did, because the meatballs were big, saucy and  spoonable, since our party of three only managed to get two sets of plastic silverware. I guess it's not just Nathan who's math is a little fubar'd.The pizza was rather superb. So superb that, even armed with only basil and tomatoes, it was enough to satiate a palette accustomed to deep dish pepperoni sausage with buffalo sauce and buffet breadsticks.This was like re-education for my taste buds, but without the hard labor and Chinese man screaming in my face about how awesome communism is.The question about whether my hair was real or not aside, the staff were  accommodating and friendly. If I ever find myself lost in the dark and lonely place that is downtown Phoenix on a Sunday after 6pm, I will definitely keep Mamma Mia's in mind. And I will remember my "freebie" chips. Dear Phoenix,This isn't Salt Lake City. Cut this Sunday nonsense out.Love,MeAhhh Pizza......I love pizza.  Am I a pizza snob...yes and no.  If I have my choice, I would leave all the chains behind....Pizza Hut, Little Ceasers, Dominos, they are all blah.  Not alot of taste and the dough is just ....well...blah!  I seek out the local mom and pop joints, the ones that will sell by the slice and might make a pie that just melts in your mouth.Mama Mia''s is that gem!!  My friend had told me about it and since we have pizza and movie night every Satruday, this has been our place.  We order and I go pick up.  It's just up the street a few blocks from where we live so it's super easy.  The gentleman that usually makes the pizza looks straight outta New York/New Jersey.  It's him and his cousin running the show and he runs this place while his cousin runs the other location.  The crust is devine....like a thin crust should be and I can see myself walkin down the street in New York and ducking in for a slice.  This location is tiny though.  They have the kitchen and an area with about 4 tables and that's it.  I have parked in the back and every time I leave they let me go out the back door right to my car.  Nice.  This is my fave place in Phoenix so far.  I totally love it!  Mom and Pop shop at it's best.  If you have not tried Mama Mia's........what are you waiting for???  Go..........NOW!!I was met at the back door.  Yes, I'm your back door girl!  Parking here can be a bitch, as well as pulling into the place...but when you get there...Heaven!I got a cheese and garlic pizza to go.  I pulled into the parking lot and they said my name.  Stalker?  Nope.  Just good service, I guess.  Or maybe they know what a pain it is to park in back and walk allllllll the way around the building to get to the front door?  Anyway...This is true East Coast pizza.  Thin crust, proper sauce and amount and loads of dripping cheese.  Tons of crushed garlic, too!  My first time there, I chatted with the owner.  He actually uses Frank's for his wings!  Hey, I'm from Buffalo.  I *know* wings!  I didn't have them, but he did let me try the sauce.  Perfecto!Huge, East Coast slices, too.  The kind you have to fold in half to eat it, with grease dripping down your hand to your elbow.  THIS is what pizza is supposed to be!!!I've become a fan of Mamma Mia's.  They throw down some good NY style pies.Yous wanna go haves on a pie, I'll meet yous at Mamma Mia's.Yesterday was the first time I had been to this location.  We grabbed a quick lunch around some work I had to take care of and a funeral.  They always have some kind of deal going for 2 slices and a drink, around 4 bucks.  Big  tasty slices of delicious NY style thin crust pizza and a drink for $4 bucks.  Why would anyone go to a fast food joint when there is a Mamma Mia's nearby?I have 2 more reviews on the way for the microcosm of food that exists at the intersection of 7th St. and Indian School.I really should never have tried Mamma Mia's. The same way I should never have tried Two Hippies Burger joint (which is conveniently located next door). In fact, that's where I was headed at the time but they were closed. Being a fairly clean eater, my body does not know what to do with itself during these Sunday grease fueled gorge fests I seem to put myself through after a night of debauchery. My stomach hates me!I had a slice of plain cheese and a slice of pepperoni and yes, I devoured both. Quickly, quietly and with the stealth of a truly seasoned binge eater. Damn it was good. The slices were huge and foldable with the crust being the perfect combination of crispy and chewy. Delicious! The only complaint I have is that it's hot as hell in there. Not much can be done about that, so it's merely an afterthought. Mamma Mia's is close to home and that makes me nervous. Nervous is good. It means I have a crush on you...  *blush*

Review Text :
I stopped by Cafepino over the weekend for a family lunch (2 adults 2 kids) and had one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life. Short version: incredibly overpriced, bad food, incredibly rude and inefficient service.It started out well enough - I liked the atmosphere when we came in, and we were seated quickly. We were given a lot of different menus - apparently both breakfast and lunch/dinner items were available, and there were separate sheets with drinks and deserts. The menu was incredibly disorganized and confusing, so it took us a while to decide on the order.Eventually we decided on a couple of entrée items for the adults, two kids meals, a juice and a hot tea. This is where the trouble started. Our food took a very long time to arrive, and while we were waiting, two of the restaurant workers literally got into a shouting match a few tables away from us, which ended about 5 minutes later with one of the two storming out of the restaurant. The other person followed shortly thereafter, and their argument continued right outside, in plain sight of all customers since they were standing by the window right outside the restaurant. This series of exchanges took some effort to explain to our young children while waiting for the food.Since the restaurant was nearly empty, my guess as to the long wait for food is that perhaps one or both of the people arguing and storming out of the restaurant were supposed to be cooking and serving orders. No one stopped by to offer us some bread or small appetizer or at least to apologize about the long delay. When the food did finally arrive, it was incredibly bland and uninspired.Our kids were getting very restless by now, so I asked for the check shortly after the food arrived. I was assured that the check would be coming shortly. About 10 minutes later, our kids had enough waiting so my wife took the kids and left the restaurant, while I stayed behind to pay the bill. I made several more attempts to get the check, and was finally told that one of the people who stormed out of the restaurant in that shouting match earlier was the cashier, and they had called someone else to come in and take over, and asked me to be patient.While sitting there waiting to pay for this horror show, I watched several hapless waiters mis-deliver meals and beverages, bringing wrong food to the wrong people and having food turned away at the table numerous times.I spent about 30 minutes in which no one ever stopped by my table to offer me a complimentary beverage or dessert as a way to apologize for the long delay. To add insult to injury, when this "backup cashier" did arrive, he simply dropped the check on the table without so much as a glance at me, and ran off. And lo and behold, they simply billed me for the full amount - get this, $70 for two kids meals and two adult entrées, a juice and a hot tea.To recap - I sat through a shouting match which nearly came to blows (by restaurant employees), had to wait over half an hour for my check, and did not get so much as an apology for all that. An absolute nightmare of a restaurant, I will never go there again and wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy!Imagine what it would be like to eat an authentic french dip sandwich....A thin bread roll cooked to crusty, dark brown perfection in a brick oven, its crumb moist and chewy. Beef that's neither chewy or fatty, nor with any hint of gristle. Caramelized onions that add just the right amount of flavor.And all of this this topped with mozzarella cheese, delicious, authentic mozzarella cheese in the correct proportion to the meat...not so much as to create a chewy glob, yet enough to add even more flavor to an already delicious treat.Now add a flavorful au jus that doesn't rely on salt for its too too delicious taste.It's a fucking miracle this sandwich.A real life miracle.I've never experienced a french dip as heavenly as Cefepino's, making me conclude how one day when I decide to fuck-it-all...no longer eating sensibly or exercising, I'm going to live out the remainder of my days eating these things until I swell like a tick, pop and keel over.The service was highly attentive with a variety of new faces stopping by every few minutes to fill our glasses, wipe down the table between servings, or provide information relative to the menu choices. One of the servers even provided the background of the restaurant, which we learned has a long and storied history in Paris.The house chianti paired splendidly with my minestrone and french dip.A small (quarter sized) ramequin of horseradish was also served with the meal, it was slightly creamed and had a mildly strong flavor, in a word, supreme.Overall, this was an extremely pleasant dining experience.If you're a French bread aficionado and, you live in Phoenix Metro where you know there just aren't that many places to get hard crust, oven-fired breads, you have another option....Cafepino.Cafepino in my opinion is definitely a standout in the lineup of mediterranean eateries here in Scottsdale.

Whenever I am in the mood to be a raging fat kid at lunch, this is my go to spot on Mill. Its seriously all disgustingly fattening, and all disgustingly delicious.. because usually, those two things go hand in hand. They've got the build your own burrito thing going on, which also applies for the tacos, nachos, quesadillas and tortas.. I usually get the carnitas burrito, with all my favorite fixings, and holy loaded burrito Batman, they do NOT skimp on the fillings. Its always too big to fit in my mouth, and always too big to finish the whole thing. Perfect for sharing. Today I tried the steak quesadilla, and on the side, just for fun, I decided to get the enchilada sauce for dipping. Its homemade, and perfect. Try this immediately. The staff are awesome and wicked fun.. They also don't nickel and dime you for salsa & sauces like other burrito/taco joints do. I hate it when that happens.The best part about this place is that its not just a place to scarf down fatty deliciousness while widening your waist size, they also have a full bar with tons of different tequilas, extremely eclectic decor, the chandelier is my personal fave and they are really big supporters of saving the tata's. They sell coozies that advertise this and all proceeds go towards finding a cure for breast cancer. So basically, if you love Mexican food, booze, and boobs, this is where you need to be. mmm.

Review Text :
I'm going to be all over the place with this review.  That will pretty much match the experience I had here.  First drink, PERFECTION!  I chose the White Grapefruit Cosmopolitan with Absolut Ruby Red, white cranberry juice and lime.  Second drink, not so much.  Way too much white cranberry juice and not enough Absolut.  No one likes a weak drink, lame!Since it was my first time here, I didn't realize that if you sit outside, you're only allowed to order off the bar menu.  I like that and I don't.  The "cheap" side of me likes it because, well, I'm cheap.  Cheap here equals $16 compared to $32 for a full menu item.  The other part of me thinks if it's a nice night out, why wouldn't I want to dine outside with a full menu.  Whatevs, no biggie.My eyes zeroed in on the Lobster Mac-N-Cheese, of course!  And for $16 it better be darn good!  Totally worth it.  The cheese was nice and creamy with big pieces of lobster and bread crumbs on the top.  I'd give that 4 stars!We also ordered a mix between a meat, cheese and Charcuterie Platter.  So the cheese, solid (how do you mess cheese up?).  Sweet pickles, best part of the platter.  The meat....straight outta the Giant Eagle deli section.  It was a poor mans excuse for prosciutto and bologne.  Gross.  Don't order!Factor in pretty inconsistent service between our server being there ALL the time to totally disappearing at the end of the meal when we wanted the check and you've got a iffy experience.I'm not throwing in the towel, I would come back and try out the full menu in the dining room.  All I would ask for is a complete package...that's not too much to ask for, is it?!***The chefs at Nine On Nine did a good job sourcing and cooking proteins (foie gras, squab); while I was not a huge fan of all of the flavor combinations, there is definitely good food here even if it is a little expensive***Nine On Nine is a fine dining spot located in Downtown Pittsburgh (not too far from PNC Park and apparently near some theaters in the city).  The restaurant has a small neighborhood restaurant or cafe feel with hardwood floors and an open (but cozy and not industrial) kitchen.The restaurant's decor feels very warm and approachable, but the menu sounds quite ambitious.  Nine On Nine has a tasting menu as well as ingredients you don't often see like squab.The bread was standard stuff.  There was a mix of focaccia, country bread and a decent and hearty fruit and nut bread.  The bread was sliced unevenly, but I did like the creamy whipped butter, which was topped with strong salt.I started with the seared foie gras, which was a small portion.  The foie gras was garnished with spring onion marmalade, brioche, gelatin, and crispy meringue-like pieces.  There were a lot of sweet elements on the plate, but they went well with the foie gras, which had an expected salty flavor.I thought the onion marmalade was very good--definitely sweet but still with an onion flavor.  I liked the brioche--great outside sear but still soft and moist.  The foie gras was good--buttery, creamy and flavorful.For my entree, I went with the squab, which featured both the breast and the legs.  The squab was served with hominy, chorizo, zucchini, arugula, and lemon.  I thought the squab was very good.  The breast was moist, juicy and tender.  It was a little like duck breast but had a bouncier texture.  The legs were crispy and good.I liked all the sides individually though it was not my favorite combination of flavors.  There was definitely a strong lemon flavor to the dish.For dessert, I had the coconut panna cotta, which was garnished with compressed pineapple, kiwi, pink peppercorn brittle, and a kaffir lime sauce.  The panna cotta was good.  It did not have a strong coconut flavor, but I liked the creaminess and lightness of it.The fruit was really good.  I liked the brightness, sweetness and tartness that the pineapple and kiwi provided.  The brittle was on the chewy side and did not have that crunch and snap you get with a lot of brittle (but I still liked it).  The brittle had a very strong pink peppercorn flavor.The kaffir lime sauce did not add much to the plate.  It did not have a distinct flavor.  It did not have a bad flavor, but I was not a fan of the consistency, which was kind of like snot.Service was good.  My server was pleasant, polite, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu.Prices were high.  Entrees were in the high $20s and $30s, which made Nine On Nine feel more expensive than Pittsburgh's Salt of the Earth (which seems like a more impressive restaurant).Nine On Nine is a good restaurant.  I thought they did a good job with the foie gras and the squab.  While I was not a huge fan of all of the flavor combinations (especially with the squab), I liked a lot of what was served.  I definitely enjoyed Avenue B more and thought Salt of the Earth felt much more original, but Nine On Nine is still a decent option for an upscale dinner in Pittsburgh.I am not sure what the parking situation is.  I think there are a few nearby paid lots.My experience here was a mixed bag.   We went in around 7:45 on a Friday evening without a reservation and were able to get seated before the bartender even had a chance to finish making my white grapefruit martini which was very refreshing.For dinner, I opted to start with the spring salad minus the pig ear bacon.   This was FABULOUS!!!  I would have ordered a second one if it wasn't $10.  I followed this up with the Tagliatelle Pasta (tomatoes, garlic and squash, oh my) which could have been amazing but was only so-so because I was served the most undercooked pasta ever.   The flavors in the dish were awesome.  I wanted to lick the plate but it was hard to get past the chewy pappardelle noodles (not tagliatelle) which were 2 minutes short of al dente.   I did mention this to the waiter who passed along the info to the chef which I appreciated (witnessed it since the kitchen is so open).We passed on a dessert which is a rarity because they just didn't have many options and the ones they did weren't up our alley.   I was craving cheesecake or some kind of fall dessert (maybe an apple turnover).Now here's the weird part.  When the bill came, there were only three items on the menu (my dinner wasn't listed).  I thought my pasta had been comped because it was so undercooked but then I realized the items in the bill totaled $16 less than the total bill  (ie something was in the total that wasn't in the itemized listing).  It just so happened to be my pasta.  When I pointed it out the waiter, he just said it was an error in the system.  Perhaps I'm reading into it, but I just thought it was shady that I was paying for it but it wasn't appearing on the bill.   I don't know; must be the accountant in me.The inside of the restaurant is pleasant and the service was so-so.  The waiter was a little inattentive given how few tables were filled.   Overall though, I was pretty pleased.   I really loved their use of flavors so I was more than willing to pay the higher-end prices but I was disappointed in my undercooked pasta.Why didn't anyone tell me to dine at Nine on Nine sooner, rather than later?  I feel so stupid!  I have been there twice in the past couple of weeks and I have worked not far from this place forever.  Somehow, I thought that this place was farther away than it is.  Oh, idiot, idiot , idiot! The décor and atmosphere of Nine on Nine reminds me of an intimate spot that you can go to, relax, eat, drink and be very merry!  There used to be this show back in the Nineties, called "New York Undercover" where one of the main character's father owned a nightclub.  Even though, the club was imaginary, somehow Nine on Nine gives me the same vibe, but in a restaurant version.  The only thing missing from this place, for me, is a live jazz trio strumming along quietly in the background.Now let's talk about the food and service...  Love, love, love the menu!  The appetizer and salad menu isn't really that expansive, but what they offer is lovely.  Daily Ceviche, soup, roasted chicken and salmon offerings that change based upon what's fresh at the market.  On a recent visit, they offered the chicken with a blueberry barbecue sauce and fiddlehead ferns.  WHAT???  In Pittsburgh???  Come again?  My buddies ordered their home-made cream of mushroom soup and I think that they may have wanted to order seconds.My buddies also ordered the Korean Barbeque Brisket with pickled vegetables, jalapeño peppers, Napa slaw, Sriracha mayo on a baquette.  I ordered the Crab Po' Boy with chive aioli, arugula and charred tomatoes served on a baquette.  Both sandwiches were served with Nine on Nine's Pomme Frites.  I love fresh cut fries and these were scrumpdillyicious, as well as the crabcakes!  My buddies also thoroughly enjoyed their brisket sandwiches. (They said that they would order the sandwiches again, but leave off the jalapeños.  Those jalapeño peppers kicked their azzes!)On another recent visit, I got the same Crab Po' Boy, but I ordered the Pommes Frites with black truffle aioli.  OMG!  (Picture Martin Lawrence in the background as his character Sheneneh, saying, "Oh mah goodneshhh!")   Seriously, my mouth is still watering a little, RIGHT NOW!  My lunch partner ordered the Fish Tacos with blackened fish, pico de gallo, avocado, cilantro, cabbage, spice crème and jalapeno peppers.  I wish that you could hear the sounds that we were making on both occasions.  (Picture Pac Man chewing through things with that sound he makes in the background.)  Ridiculous, I know, but sometimes you just have to surrender to your base instincts.I want to go to Nine on Nine for their Chef's Tasting.  At $90 per person, it's a little steep for a mom who pays quite a buck for their kid's high school tuition.  However, it's a treat that I want to meet sometime this year.  "I die" for Roasted Bone Marrow and I even have my teenage daughter Muff wrapped up in marrow love.  They have Roasted Bone Marrow here too, along with other dishes that I have swooned over in other cities!  Who knew and where have I been?Anyway, run and don't walk to Nine on Nine.  The staff will treat you with kid gloves and it may be your next home.

OK. So apparently some yelpers think reviewing chain or fast food restaurants is gauche. Well, bully for them. To each is own right. Me? Sometimes after a 12 hour day at work my empty stomach gets home to an empty fridge. Papa John's is open til 1AM. Hey, for Phoenix, that's pretty damn good. And while Domino's crust is similar to the cardboard disc that a frozen Tombstone sits on and Pizza Hut dough has more yeast than a yeast infection. Papa John's drives it home. Literally. Tangy, sweeter tomato sauce with crumbled, non grizzled Italian sausage and a perfect amount of cheese on a thin crust. My tummy was happy. I ordered it on line at work and when I got home I waited about 10 minutes before Papa showed. But I have my own name for him. I call him Daddy John. Oh yea. Thanks Daddy!

Is it possible? Another 5 star review for a Sushi joint? Yes! Yes it is. I was going to have dinner with my BFAM, Kevin and decided to look up Sushi. I chose Yen due to the great reviews and BOY was I glad that I did. We were greeted and chose to sit at the sushi bar. I suggested to Kev that we go Chef's choice all the way. Of course my brother said "Hell yeah" to that! The Chef was mildly surprised at the request but quickly warmed up to the idea. If he was aiming to blow our socks off, he was dead on. There is something about simply made, FRESH food that tends to wow me. He started us off with a sashimi plate to die for. It included salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and octopus. Amazing. Every slice was fresh, not even a hint of being old. The best way to describe the after taste is "Clean", no fishiness or weird after taste. The chef then presented us with thinly sliced striped bass with fresh wasabe. Amazing... amazing! The slices of bass were so thin, you could see the plate underneath. The next thing we ordered was eel. Now, I'm usually not a fan of eel because it seems gritty or greasy to me. When we were served the eel, I was surprised to find nothing of the sort on my plate. It was delicious! The eel was crisp and flaky from the broiling. The entire meal was great from start to finish. I can't wait to visit Yen again.One of the photos here shows a tempura battered jalapeno half filled with all sorts of goodness. All I have to say is: put-it-in-my-mouth. Last night's dinner at Yen was re-frickin-diculous. Dottsy suggested going balls to the wall with the Chef's Choice and she was not wrong. We started off with miso soup, then a small pickled cucumber salad. Then the sashimi plate arrived. As much as I wanted to scream "MINE!" and fight off my friends' advancing chopsticks, I held back. Salmon, tuna, albacore, yellowtail and octopus graced this huge display and each one was really mouth-watering. the octopus in particular was delicate and not at all rubbery. The tuna melted on my chopsticks before dissolving completely on my tongue. After we raided the sashimi plate we were delivered some baked roll that was inhaled before the server even left the table. I have to admit that after that roll we waited a good 20 minutes for another one to arrive, or even more. That was a bummer, but fortunately we had excellent company with whom to pass the time. In total we had the sashimi plate plus 5 rolls, which was a gut-busting affair. We completemented our meals with big ole sapporos and a few people had sake(bombs). All in all the measure of a sushi place is how fresh their cuts of fish are and Yen is tied for first on my list of best sushi places. The $60 per person price tag was a little scary but I do feel like the quality warranted the price tag, if not the quantity of rolls. And even though this is a hike, I will be back because of the spectacular work they did with their fish.Ugh ..I wanted to like Yen. But I am thinking it was never meant to be. My husband warned me that I wouldn't like it. And that it was pricey. But I was  determined to prove him wrong and took  my girls.  As we entered I immediately had a great vibe, rich dark wood , cozy ,  but tasteful and clean. No overbearing screaming TV, no tacky decor. I knew I was going to love this place. Then to find out they had a Happy Hour Sushi Menu , I was quite pleased. But that is where it began to fall apart. As  soon as she brought me my Diet Coke in a can I was frightened.Nothing good comes of coke in a can with a meal unless you are serving pizza or brats off a cart.After discussing with the waitress that the 10 year old wanted sashimi with nothing on it  ,hers arrived with chives , white radishes  and and oniony soyish sauce... Her two plates of sashimi were quickly pronounced "gross".  Even I didn't like one of them.( they did comp that item ) My Happy Hour sushi was blah, no pizzazz  except  the cream cheese chunk in the Phil. roll.   Teenager Daughter acted like she liked her Teriayki  but when pressed for a review gave it only 3 out 6 stars aaaahhhh.  The edadame was fresh and tasty   but I am thinking that's not enough to get my girls back.  I on the other hand really want to like it so if you are willing to buy me dinner and a diet coke I'll try it again.Very bad service.Long wait, rude waiter, have to wave down waiter to get service.Happy hour prices are good, rolls are cheap but not worth the service tradeoff.I'll never go back, and neither will any of my friends.I went there for the happy hour but left after I got pissed after being treated like a door mat.Found an even better place 2 miles west, Tokyo Lobby.Friendly greeting, good service, better happy hour, and $5 large sake bombers ALL day long.K Sushi on 43rd and Olive has the best roll i've had though, Nebraska roll, its awesome.Don't know their happy hour prices but they have $24.95 all you can eat.....I got 6 orders of rolls....They have 50 state rolls, one named after every state, plus all the traditional rolls.My money works the same in every restaurant, but Yen will never get another dime.OMG THIS IS MY 500th REVIEW!  HOLY COW I CAN"T BELIEVE I MADE IT THIS FAR! Plus, it was my birthday on Tuesday the 12th, which makes it an even BETTER week!But, here's how our Friday afternoon happy celebration went:So a bunch of us girls decided to do happy hour after work today, and one of my coworkers suggested this place. I don't eat sushi often, and usually need help ordering since I have no clue what I'm doing!Upon entering, I really liked how the place was set up. Cute tables, with a great Asian flare.  Not flashy, but not understated either. My friends helped me order off the happy hour menu, and the food was delicious! I went with a deep fried california roll, along with another dish that I split with my friend. I can't remember the name of it, but I do know it had pink fish on top with white rice underneath.The service was a bit slow at first, but eventually got better as the night went on. We were getting antsy to order, and kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting some more. Eventually the service picked up, but it took a little bit. We had a big table and there were lots of mouths to feed, so it was evened out in the end.Overall, I was happy with eating here.  Plenty of food, great menu, and amazing happy hour prices.  Place was packed, so get there early so you can get a seat and get your grub on from 3-5.

Review Text :
Worst BBQ ever! Bland, flavorless and over priced (see below). We were hoping that this place would be a knock out considering it's just but the house.. to our disappointment this place is horrible.. took a few bites and the pork tasted so old that we tossed the rest in the trash. Whats funny is that the guys working saw us throw the meat out but didn't ask what the problem was.. ah well.. the lemonade here was awesome though.. some of the best lemonade Ive had in ages! I'm actually surprised that this place isn't out of business yet as its always empty.. a real shame.. we were SO excited when we first saw the banner go up.. maybe they can turn it around before its to late though I'm afraid to go back.When I say over priced I mean when you order 15 bucks of food then throw it in the trash because it tastes old, then leave hungry, well don't you think thats over priced?My husband wanted gelato, so we decided to check out the newly remodeled Bashas' in the same plaza.  After perusing the aisles unsuccessfully trying to decide what to have for dinner, we settled on Italian take-out, but then it turned to Oriental Garden, and somehow we ended up with BBQ.  It is Memorial Day after all.First time here, and for $21 we got a sampler than included 1/2 lb each of pork, chicken, and beef with 3 sides and cornbread.  Here's the lowdown on our experience.-Chicken was very dry and I didn't care for the flavor at all.  Of course, smothered in sauce, it was better.-Beef was sliced thin and reminded me more of a deli-style meat than a BBQ.  It wasn't bad, just not what I wanted.-Pork was the best, but I've still had better.  Not smoky or flavorful enough on its own.-I liked both the mild and the spicy sauces luckily.-Cole slaw-I've never been a cole slaw fan, but I liked it.  My husband who dislikes almost any cole slaw except KFC liked it as well.-Potato salad-Although it needed salt, it was okay.  I liked that it was NOT sweet or swimming in mayo.  I think it would be better with the potatoes peeled, since they use a standard russet and the skins were tough.-Baked beans-I really liked these as they were not in some thick disgustingly sweet syrup.-Corn bread-Delicious with whole kernel corn and rosemary, I believe.Overall, I would go back since close to home, but I'll stick with the pork..with the sauce and a salt shaker nearby.  And next time, I won't have gelato first so I can try their cobbler if it's available!Sorry to say this next-door BBQ spot is lacking...I have tried it three times now... each time I find myself wondering why I am here again. The decor is just plain sad... something between a fast food taco shop and a dollar store. The service is SLOW!!! REALLY SLOW!!!Popped by here for the last time on Saturday night with my kids. Two half-racks of over-cooked ribs and three mac and cheese orders with a can of diet coke set us back over $40. Which I would have gladly paid at Joe's, Waldo's, or even Famous Dave's. To be fair - on my first visit and (when they still seemed to care) my pulled pork sandwich was decent.I really wanted this place to do well since I can walk here, but alas it seems they are barely hanging on and cutting corners.I was super stoked when I realized there was a BBQ joint close to my office... too bad it's just "OK".I couldn't really tell the difference in taste or looks between the pulled pork and the brisket.  Seriously.  It was weird.  The spicy BBQ sauce is garbage and literally looks and tastes like Ketchup with hot sauce added.  Bunk.  The Lemonade was, surprisingly, very watery and bland.  The side of beans was OK, nothing special.  Next!I was recently introduced to Scottsdale BBQ Co by fellow Yelpers who Know Their Food.  As I enjoyed my juicy burger that day, I knew two things to be true: 1) this place would make a great lunch spot for my perpetually hungry co-workers (guys like BBQ, what can I say?), and 2) I could not die happy without trying the tri tip sirloin sandwich.  So, back at the office I warned everyone to break out their "big stretchy pants" and get ready for a field trip to Fantastic BBQ Land.We piled in on a Friday ready to EAT.  Right off, everyone appreciated the down-home, no-frills feel, complete with a loud screen door, gingham tablecloths and the specials listed out on a chalkboard.  After chatting with the owner (who is super cool, by the way) we all ended up with either tri-tip sirloin or pulled pork sandwiches, all with the most amazing spicy BBQ sauce you will ever taste.I had the sirloin tri-tip I had been thinking about since my last visit.  So worth waiting for!  Huge - I couldn't finish it (and I really, really tried).  My side, of course, was mac n cheese which I promptly decorated with Tabasco.  Mac n cheese o' fire!  Others had baked beans, potato salad, mac n cheese sans tabasco (silly boys, afraid of the burn...), and caesar salad.  The caesar looked especially good, with nice slivers of parmesan gracing the top.  I stole a few.  Ok, more than a few... All in all, everyone walked out happy (and ready for a nap!).  It was a messy, good, 6-napkin per person experience.I would recommend you get down to Scottsdale BBQ for some downscale, down-home, downright delicious BBQ and southern cooking.  If Yelp had a rating system that allowed a higher degree of detail than single stars I would put them at about 3.5 but I rounded up based on the value for your money here.I shared a family platter,  $22.95 or so, with my family.  A full slab of ribs, 1/2 pound of pulled chicken, two sides and dessert.The ribs were yummy as was the potato salad and the mandarin side salad.  I had an extra side of red beans and rice which were ok, not quite as good as the other dishes.We finished with peach cobbler.  Outstanding!   Before we ordered it we inquired if it was made from canned peaches or fresh.  They make it from fresh peaches which they marinate on site.  Great cobbler.  I would come back just for that.The portion sizes on the sides and desserts is very generous so keep that in mind when you order.

Review Text :
There are plenty of hit or miss spots in this jumpin' area of St Denis, and Confusion starts off on the wrong foot by only opening at 5:30pm (totally unexpected on a street where the terraces are usually full of folks eating and drinking wine and sangria by noonish.) But it's got some mojo working for it - the outdoor patio is small and surrounded by a thick hedge making you feel like you're in a garden but still right in the swirl of action on the street. The indoor seating downstairs feels like a quirky, lush bistro carved into a 200 year old stone foundation. Some of the seating is booths, some is swings, which we avoided due to our pre-dinner drinks and general klutziness, but we are pro indoor swings in general. The tapas options are diverse, we enjoyed the duck rolls, chorizo, and scallops in particular. Everything was very flavourful and suited the fabulous if slightly boudoir decor. The service was friendly, funny and attentive.

Review Text :
I like seafood. I like pizza. So I ordered the seafood pizza. Big mistake. I had been waiting about 20 minutes for it when the waitress informed me that it didn't look good, and she'd asked the cook to start over. It didn't look good? What does that mean? Sounded like she was looking out for me, though, so I didn't complain. Well, I don't know what the first one looked like, but it couldn't have been good if it looked worse than the second one, which arriving another 20 minutes later, kind of looked like... soup! Seafood pizza soup. The sauce (1 part tomato sauce / 3 parts water?) was actually dripping off the plate. I tried to pull out a slice and all I got was soggy crust, because all the toppings, cheese included, slid right off and landed with a splash. The shrimp were mushy, like little bad bananas. The squid (I think it was squid, but I don't know that for sure) tasted like pencil erasers. Really Gross (that's right, that's no typo, that's Gross with a capital 'G').The waiter was placing a "They Love us On Yelp" sticker on the door when we walked up....COOL!I've never been a fan of that typical chopped tomato bruschetta.The Bruschetta here Was AAAMMMAAAAAZZIIIING!!! (see pics)They have 6 toppings and you get to choose 4.I chose the Roasted Artichoke, Caprese, Salami  Pesto and the Prosciutto, Fig & Truffled Marscapone...........Let me tell you the salami one I didn't care for the other were very good But Next Time I will Order ALL Prosciutto...UNBELIEVABLE right down to the Chewy toasted bread.I will be dreaming about it from now on I guarantee it!I also couldn't not resist anything with Mushroom and ordered the Truffled Harvest Mushroom Pizza (see pics)It had harvest mushrooms, melted tomatoes, goat cheese, baby spinach, white truffle oil.......WHOA! Scrumdiddlyumptious!I could have easily eaten the whole damn thing, but was nice enough to share a couple slices with my friend who only ordered ...."a salad"One more thing that sounded really good was the Turkey & Brie sandwich (see pics) it had oven roasted organic turkey, brie, fig, apple, lettuce, tomato, ciabatta. Accompanied by your choice of seasonal couscous, house-made coleslaw or seasoned potato chips.I chose the cous cous.Compared to the other mouthwatering delights this sandwich really fell short ,neither my daughter or I really cared for it ......the bread was not even up to par with the other breads we tasted and the turkey was a bit dry. However the Cous Cous Was Fantastic!!! I would love to have ordered just some of that.I will go back for sure.I've never been to Postino so I cant make the comparison like some of the others and I thoroughly enjoyed it so who cares anyway!So I went back to La Bocca. Didn't enjoy my last experience - the service or the food - but with all the other positive Yelp reviews out there, I decided to give them another chance. And I'm glad I did. Because this time was better. Not awesome, but definitely better. Up from two stars to three.Last time I ordered the seafood pizza, which was Gross, which I didn't even see on the menu anymore. Hmmm... wonder what happened there.This time I ordered the Oven Roasted Shrimp and Pesto Sandwich, which was quite tasty. Kind of tasted like bruschetta actually, but with pesto and shrimp. Which was fine with me - I love bruschetta. Bread was lightly toasted, shrimp were plump and juicy. Choice of sides included cole slaw, couscous and chips. I got the chips, and they weren't bad, just your basic restaurant potato chips. My friend ordered the Turkey & Brie Sandwich with the couscous. She enjoyed the sandwich, but not the couscous so much. It was served cold, which I don't think she was expecting.Service was definitely better this trip - friendlier and much more efficient. We were in and out in about an hour. Weird thing was we were the only ones there. I mean, I know it's Monday, but still - only one table between 11 & 12? That can't be good.La Bocca was on my radar since it opened earlier this year... I cannot believe how long it took me to finally get there, but it was worth the wait.  I went with a group of four on a Monday night.  (1/2 Price Bottles of Wine from 5pm - close on Mondays; needless to say, we took advantage of that special!)We let my friend Anthony do the ordering since he'd been many times before and he also has a vested interest of sorts... We started with two salads: the prosciutto, zucchini, and artichoke (my favorite) and the goat cheese and pear... also quite tasty.  You can't go wrong with either one.  We then had the truffled harvest mushroom and the spiced pepperoni pizzas.  Yum!  The thin crust and the combination of fresh ingredients on both of them were perfect!  Along the way, owner Julian Wright sat down with us to share some wine and conversation - he's fantastic!  While he was completely engaged in talking to our group, I could tell he was also constantly surveying the restaurant to make sure all was running smoothly.  Every patron that walked in the door received immediate attention including our group.  Our waitress was sweet and I liked that she gave some attitude back to Jared when he was joking around with her.We had a blast on top of a great meal and ended up staying for hours enjoying  two bottles of wine (maybe more than that as I lost track) during that time.  One of them was a La Crema Pinot Noir, but I think we had a merlot as well and maybe another Italian Red.  I guess I'll have to go back and take notes next time.  Another reason to return will be to try the brusschetta - it sounds amazing.  I have a feeling it won't take me as long to return to La Bocca as it took for me to get there in the first place.  You can't go wrong at La Bocca if you're looking for pizza, salad, wine, and all in a warm, welcoming atmosphere.  Check out their other daily pecials too - I know I will!Finally tried out this new wine bar/pizzeria. I didn't have too many great expectations, as I had read the ever-insightful Kristen's review noting that this was "a starter wine bar for college kids."It is, but considering what else Mill Ave/Downtown Tempe has to offer, I'll still take it! Ha ha. First, I love the décor; they're one of the few Tempe area restaurants to pick up that more downtown Phoenix vibe and style. The quirky celebrity photos lining the wall by the ladies' room make me smile - I want to be in those pictures! What are they doing? Is that Cate Blanchette smoking a joint on the john?? The giant portrait over the bar is pretty cool too.OK since I have an issue with brevity, I'll try to make short comments on the basics: Service: Pretty good. Came in for a quick drink on the patio one day and the server was incredibly friendly, cool and actually helpful (I'm always shocked by mature and efficient service on Mill Ave, which is littered with student hosts/bartenders/servers who act bored, annoyed and are slow and simply don't give a damn - I'm looking at you, RA).  Service cont'd: When I came back for dinner our server was still good, and the poor guy had to deal with the fact that this restaurant does not appear to have its shit together at the moment. Case in point - checked the web site for price range before committing. (Btw I LOVE when restaurants have their entire menu, including prices for food AND drinks online; this one does.) On their home page, they list their daily specials, and Sunday was half-off bottles. Show up and have to sit at the bar for a minute because they appear to be in the aftermath of a Gammage pre-show rush. No prob. I ask the bartender if there's a separate menu for the half off bottles. His gruff response: "We don't do that." Then stares at me. No explanation, no follow up, no suggestions/alternatives. So I bring it up with the server because I want answers. His explanation was sort of a meandering list of a couple of reasons that just kind of sounded like the restaurant didn't wan to do it anymore. Tried ordering or asking about a couple other things (I wanted a wine they no longer carried but still on the menu and asked too about the Sunday movies) and he uncomfortably explained the restaurant is doing a lot of "restructuring" right now and things are changing and information on the menu and web site is outdated. Kind of annoying when you hear that about three requests/questions in a row. Food: Pretty damn good. The organic seasonal happened to be a white pizza with merlot soaked mushrooms and spinach. For $11 it was big enough to share for two who aren't starving. Or you can share a salad or app as well. The ingredients were delicious and were of good quality, not to mention the crust was ... I don't know that I can even explain it. Grilled and chewy and buttery and soft and wonderful all at once. Glasses of red started at $7, and yes were of pedestrian choices, mostly from Cali - if you have a local organic pizza, maybe have local wine too? Kudos for having homemade sangria on the menu (giving Caffe Boa a real run, eh?) Décor/atmosphere: see first graph for décor. Atmosphere was nice. Low key, they turned the lights down pretty low and servers are laid back. Loud in the large, open space though. Couches with tables (though the here the tables are actually lower than the seat, so would make for an awkward eating arrangement) are scattered throughout along with regular tables and some tall seating as well as a short bar area. You have the exact opposite issue if you sit at the long booth in the middle of the room, as those small tables are much higher than are comfortable - I feel like my wine glass was at neck level! Patio is nice with tables and couches as well.  So, all in all, I judge it on a relative scale because, well, there's really nothing else like it in the area (nearby CB is much pricier). p.s. hey, remember when I said I was going to be brief? Ha!Before I get to review La Bocca, I need to deal with legal "fine print". It's called "fine print" because it will make everything "fine" if you handle it correctly (you'll just have to trust me on this...I am a highly trained "businessman").The "fine print" disclaimer for this review follows:The Beautiful Carin is the sister of Peter, one of the managers of La Bocca. As such, I receive (and, hopefully will continue to receive, as long as we both shall live...it's in our marriage vows:), "special treatment" at La Bocca. That "special treatment" includes: Great Service; Great Food; Great Conversation; Great Atmosphere...hang on...Peter says La Bocca treats everybody that way...crap, I thought I was "special".OK, weasel words out of the way, on to the review. The Beautiful Carin and I wanted to go back to La Bocca for dinner and last night was the night!The beautiful Carin's brother, the Cordial and Talented Restaurateur, Peter greeted us with a welcoming hug (he may or may not do that for you...you'll just have to marry one of his sisters yourself and see), and we sat down.The joint was jumpin'... Friday evening in downtown Tempe always seems to have lot going on. We had Matt as our server and he was friendly and attentive, got us drinks and some outstanding warm olives and crusty Italian bread...I could have made a meal of that alone! I didn't...I needed to build up calories for my work out this morning. Last night, I hadn't eaten anything since the  1/2 chicken and waffle at Lolo's for lunch...I was famished:)We ordered bruschetta...they have a very nice selection ranging from standard tomato/mozzarella to minced Queen Creek olives on ricotta. We had had a couple of these at the OYE last Sunday evening and they were good then and they were good last night!We had a little time as we enjoyed our wine and appetizers and sort of surveyed the room. I was really pretty interested in whether we were getting the friends and family treatment or whether our experience was pretty typical...It seemed like the typical experience. Matt was handling 3-5 other tables, at the same time as ours, and they were all smiling and happy. It was the same story throughout the place...everybody looked like they were having a good time:)Our salads arrived...Carin had the Caprese and I had a Caesar...here's where I figured I was getting the "insider" deal. I like anchovies (I know, go figure:) and Matt asked the kitchen to put some on my salad, since they don't generally do that. I whispered my "thanks" to him, because I didn't want the other diners to become agitated that I was getting something they could never hope to get...but Matt said in a loud voice, "no, anyone who wants anchovies can have them"...another perk, dashed!We ordered 2 pizza's...the Porko (pulled pork, caramelized onions and serrano peppers...tasty and spicy) and the meat something (I don't always remember the names, but 3 meats, olives and I added serrano's to that one...yum:)Nicely done pizza's...hot and gooey cheese, fresh and high quality toppings, crispy with a just a little blackening around the edges. Plenty to eat and we had leftovers to take home!Finally, we did dessert at La Bocca last night (last time I was here, my "offsite" dessert experience, while memorable, was less than a complete success:)They make a chocolate brownie with liquid chocolate/espresso center. They put ice cream on top and drizzle it with caramel...and crack, apparently. I was just going to have a bite...I hoovered this thing down so fast I think I embarrassed my sweet beautiful and indulgent wife (who did manage to get a bite or 2 of the dessert, but not much more). In spite of the spoon and napkins, I still looked like a 2 year old with his first soft serve chocolate ice cream cone.So, what's the upshot...Peter, I hate to say it, but even if you never work another day at La Bocca, I'm going back...often. In the meantime, I expect some special treatment the next time I go in! If you want special treatment, you need to go find one of Peters other marriageable sisters (he has 14 of them) and get yourself in the family...or just go in to La Bocca and tell them I sent you:)And give Peter a hug...he enjoys it...trust me;)Great pizza, with an ingredient list that is actually fairly unique.  This is also a place to go for build-your-own, if you're into that kind of thing.  I like to experience the chef's creations, so I order from the menu.  Last night I sampled (like I'm going to tell you how much I ate!!) both the truffled mushroom pizza and the bocca trio.  The mushroom pizza was nearly overwhelmed by the spinach, but the truffle oil and the goat cheese managed to shine despite the subtle flavor of each.  I personally believe mushrooms don't taste like anything, they just are, so I can't comment on their quality.  The other pizza, the Bocca Trio, is a bit like a good old-fashioned meat-lovers' pizza from Pizza Hut in that it has three different meats on it.  There the similarities end; the menu name-drops Genoa and Schreiner's as the source of the salami and sausage, respectively, not deigning to attach any adjectives to the pepperoni.  The whole package works fairly well, with the olives and the cheeses and the tomatoes and everything.  One thing I did notice in going back and forth between the two was that there was a quite marked difference in done-ness.  The crust of the Trio was quite charred, while the other pizza had no black at all.  I'm not sure if this was intentional (I thought it was the styles worked for each pizza) or a side-effect of the enormous rush on the kitchen.  I love La Bocca for offering to hold large events, but if the kitchen and staff can't handle the rush, perhaps we need to look elsewhere.  The pizza size seems a bit smaller than elsewhere - I would recommend a hungry couple split three or try a generous bruschetta plate to take the edge off.  For the sweet-toothed, I also sampled a pizza cookie, on which I can't pass judgement, and a very creamy portion of the tiramisu, which I found to be fantastic.  In the end, this place misses out on the fifth star because of the service I've had on two visits.  Granted, no small or even medium-sized restaurant would not be overwhelmed by the groups I was part of, but La Bocca seems to be over-promising, biting off more than they can chew.  The wait staff tries hard, they really do, but the kitchen simply takes too long to get stuff out the door.  I might add the fifth star back if I get a chance to check this place out on a date night when it's more normal.  I think the pieces are certainly all there - I love the vibe of this place.I think people generally go to a pizzeria and bar type place for three basic things:1) Food2) Drinks3) ServiceSince I could get neither food nor drink, I can only speak to service.And I think I just did.I am not exaggerating here. I was in La Bocco for an hour before a server approached. While the pizza looked fabulous, I'd heard people talking about getting theirs 30, 45 minutes or more after they ordered. So I opted for a beer.30 minutes after that, with only one fleeting glimpse of the server, I left.Yes, it was crowded. Yes I was there for the Ignite Phoenix after-party. But it's not like it was standing room only, and they had previous notice we were coming.Walking out after an hour and a half to find your car towed (clearly not La Bocca's fault, and not a factor in the one star review) makes for a pretty lousy experience. Too bad, looked like a cool place. But seriously, it's not that difficult to pour a beer.And don't park, ever, on the southeast corner of Mill and 7th street.UPDATE: I just had to stop back by and give props to the owner Julian, who contacted me via Yelp and apologized for my poor experience. No excuses, no fluff. That's commendable, and the right way to do business. I'll have to go back and take him up on that drink offer....After my introduction to La Bocca at an Official Yelp Event recently I was impressed enough to pay another visit.I had someone visiting from corporate.  Like me, he travels frequently and likes to check out interesting food and see new places.  So I thought Mill Ave. and La Bocca would fit the bill nicely.We split bruschetta and a pizza, both were outstanding.  The bruschetta selections were as follows:  caprese with fresh pulled mozzarella - very nice.  roasted tomato, pesto & parm - also very nice with a robust pesto.  queen creek olives & ricotta - love the olives!  and the standout - prosciutto, fig & mascarpone - wonderful!  I first had the combo of fig and prosciutto at a reception in Berkeley and loved it then.  We had the porco pizza.  Another interesting combination with pulled pork, serrano chili's and other good stuff.  The thin roasted crust at La Bocca is a hit with me!The service was good but I did get a sense the server wanted to be somewhere else.  Oh well.  Overall a solid experience and I will be back.They did have a terrible time keeping up with the food at the Yelp event to the point that I was actually waiting with others by the kitchen door to try and nab some food before it was gone.Voted one of the top 25 restaurants by Phoenix Magazine, this urban chic eatery lives up to its accolades."La Bocca" literally means "the mouth."  What I love about this name is that in Buenos Aires, Argentina there is a district called "La Boca," where the Italian immigrants settled at the turn of the century.  The name is perfect for a restaurant that serves an amalgam of Latin inspired fares.The vivid photographs on the wall display an enchanting and colorful Italy, the large mural behind the bar is reminiscent of a Spanish royal portrait.  The colors of the dining and bar area are earthy, warm, and inviting - with dramatic splashes of red to infuse the senses.Seated at the bar, I was impressed by the bartender's attentiveness, and his unmatched skill in making the best mojito this side of Miami.  This was a drink that I would expect to pay $14 for in North Scottsdale.  At La Bocca, the cocktails are $7 and worth the drive.  Their signature drink is the "Clean Slate Martini," which was recommended by the amiable owner, Mr. Julian Wright.  He explained that the combination of Tanqueray, cucumber, and lime made this a smooth concoction, but I am so thrilled that I opted for the incredible blackberry mojito.This being a pizzeria, the wine list is varied and interesting.  Many of the wines are Californian, but Spain is also well represented here.  For those who enjoy whites with their pizzas, I recommend their Senorio de Cruces Albarino (Spain) - perfect with salads, pizzas, or pastas.  For a real taste of Italy, get a bottle of their Zenato Rippassa del Valpolicello (Italy) - this is a well-rouned red that is served in every Italian restaurant in Europe.There is only one place in Phoenix Metro where I believed I could find good bruschetta, (Postino) but a new contender has just entered the ring.  La Bocca offers the same - an assortment of bruschettas which can be ordered in combinations of four.  The selections range from prosciutto, mascarpone, fig, and truffle oil, to salami and house-made pesto.  And just like Postino, the rich flavors make your culinary heart melt with joy.Pizza lovers can build their own pies here, with topping choices such as heirloom tomatoes, pulled pork, chili oil, and garlic.  There are seven signature pizzas on the menu, which can easily by devoured by one guest, and range from $9-$14.  There are also sandwhiches and salads available for those who do not like the pie.If you are coming here strictly for wine, cozy up in one of the comfortable seats in the lounge.  Order a bottle of Spanish wine, and get the "anti-asti" plate.  This comes with a delectable assortment of salami, prosciutto wrapped goat cheese, manchego cheese, pesto, queen creek olives, roasted garlic, dijon, and artisan toast.  A spanish picnic, with the best pesto in town.So, if that wasn't enough to pique your curiosity - here are some extra incentives.Sundays and Mondays the bottles of wine are 1/2 off after 6:30 PM.Tuesdays enjoy your pizzas at 2-for-1 after 6:30 PMThursdays, impress your date with live musicFridays and Saturdays has reverse Happy Hour from 10 PM to closeAfter three unsuccessful attempts, I finally made it to La Bocca, and fourth time's a charm! The food was perfectly executed, the service on point and the ambiance relaxing and casual on a weekday afternoon.The order:Flight of three ice creams (sorbet - strawberry, lemon, basil, Maya Farm Mint with Chocolate Chips, Salted Caramel with Toasted Almonds) $5Bruschetta planks: pulled pork, housemade pesto, roasted red pepperMozz, basil, roma tomato, qc olive oil & balsamicMargarita pizzaWarm queen creek olives and artisan toastMediterranean plate: basil hummus, babaganoush with warm feta, roasted peppers, queen creek olives, artisan toast and house made flat breadA 5-star experience all the way.My friend wanted to come here for dinner one evening...To start, we ordered the Mediterranean plate. This was a really good appetizer. But beware because it's hugeeeee!!!! I loved the hummus and the babganoush that it came with. The cheese was good but a bit salty. For the entree we shared the truffled mushroom pizza. This thing was delicious!!!! Like reallyyyyy delicious! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Lol for drinks I ordered the red sangria and my friend got the orange blossom martini. I wasn't too fond of my sangria. I think it could've been a bit sweeter. I would definitely come back for their pizza. They also have happy hour and reverse happy hour on the weekends that I'd like to check out. It's a really cute little pizza place. Perfect for a date or even dinner with friends. They have a great outdoor patio and it's right on Mill Ave. So good for people watching. =)

What even is the real name of this restaurant? Is it Kanpai as written on the door? Is it Kampai as written on the sign? I actually have no idea and for the sake of this review, it doesn't really matter. Here is what is important about this little restaurant on the west side of town. The two chefs who own and run this restaurant, brought sushi to the valley. No, I am not kidding and its not debatable, AJ and Yuki are the original gangsters of the sushi manifestation that has occurred in Phoenix. In order to understand this revelation, we need to go back to 1985(see what I did there). A small sushi restaurant opens in Paradise Valley, right across the street from the mall. It is called Shogun and for many years is the premier sushi restaurant in the valley. Actually, for a while, it was the only sushi restaurant in the valley. Shogun has gone through various restorations and renovations over the years, but originally, it was AJ and Yuki at the small sushi bar inside Shogun with around five or six tables. These sushi geniuses built Shogun into the dynasty that it was and after a few years, moved onto their own venture, named Kampai or Kanpai, depending on which signage you are currently viewing. Kampai, found in a very shady strip mall on Bell road, has the best sushi in the valley. There is not a close second. Yuki is the main sushi chef and AJ runs the back end kitchen. Word of warning and the reason for the lack of five stars in this review. If Yuki is not your sushi chef, I cannot vouch for the restaurant at all. I know I know, that sounds brutal, but it's the truth. Yuki is an artist and meticulous. The other chefs just are not in his league and some of the specialties of the house, only taste their best when made from Yuki's hands. What makes this place so special? It certainly isn't the decor, which could not be more plain. It is far from the waitress service that is at best, hard to understand. It is the fact that the spicy tuna hand roll is the best I have ever had. The southwest salmon roll, while not only amazing, is only found at this sushi bar, no matter where in the country I have dined on sushi. The southwest salmon roll Is an inside out roll, with salmon and a house cured chili pepper with cucumber and masago on the outside. It is my favorite sushi roll on the planet. As for the sushi, this is the only place in the valley, besides Hiro in North Scottsdale, who serves live scallops. At Hiro, you will pay an arm and a leg, at Kampai, they will be fresher and you will pay fair market price, as set by AJ. The yellowtail and salmon sushi are always cured perfectly, not salty and melt in your mouth. There are both entree specials and sushi specials listed on the white boards above and next to the sushi bar. AJ makes the best salmon and yellowtail collars in the business, while serving better versions of the standard sushi bar appetizer fare, IE. Fried oysters, tempura, etc.. I will end this review here, but rest assured, if you are looking for the best, most authentic sushi dinner in the valley, Kampai is the place.THE END OF AN ERAWhat once was the best sushi restaurant in Phoenix is now under new management, and it definitely shows.They have tried to bring in new rolls similar to those at every other sushi place. They have changed the ingredients in many of their rolls, including the spicy tuna roll and the shrimp tempura rolls, which were the ones that kept us coming back. Kampai was special because it wasn't like every other Scottsdale sushi place, it had the freshest ingredients and the most authentic rolls. Not anymore.The quality of the ingredients is now very poor compared to what it used to be. The fish is sliced much too thinly. The rolls were not as fresh or as tasty even in the slightest. Their spicy tuna roll, which used to have fresh tuna and cucumbers and sprouts, is now made with a mixture of chopped tuna and spices with Krab mix. They changed their entire staff, which will come back to bite them sooner or later. The new sushi chef was rude, did not want to engage in conversation, and plainly did not acknowledge us. Our order was taken much later than we were ready to give it, and we had to ask for waters. Then, another chef came into the sushi bar area from the back wearing a plain tshirt, not a uniform, and without washing his hands he began to make our food. There were several questionable instances when cleanliness did not seem to be a concern of the sushi chefs. Sanitation is major at a sushi restaurant, and so is the food. So is the service. So is the music (which they changed from nice traditional music to soft rock?!). Since all of these things have changed, my family who has been long-time customers of Kampai for the last 15 years will sadly not be returning. Kampai, you just lost some previously dedicated customers. At least we went here in May for my birthday before they changed, I wish we knew it would be the last time that we could enjoy our favorites. I don't see how they will stay open for much longer.The Fall From Sushi Grace!! Kampai used to be my favorite sushi restraunt, there fish was very high quality and purchased fresh everyday. Now Kampai is simply meteocre, the new owners have completely changed the menu, sushi chefs, and the quality of fish has gone down drastically. Honestly I would not go back to Kampai now based on price alone, they are just to expensive for the low quality food that is served now. Less is definitely more as far as the old Kampai goes, their menu was simple and so were the ingrediants in the rolls. If you do choose to try out the downgraded Kampai I suggest the spicy tuna roll and the vegas roll, both are decent tasting. This sushi restraunt has nothing special to offer its consumers anymore. If you have been loyal to Kampai you will see how badly a mistake the original owners made when they decided to sell. Also Kampai is now open all the time so you can eat their crappy food almost anytime of the day now.

09/08/10I've eaten here a few times over the years.  Mom and I don't really care for the summer rolls (fresh, not fried, rolls of shrimp, pork, lettuce, rice noodles, and sprouts).  The peanut sauce that accompanies the rolls is good, however.  The bowls of pho and a few stir-fried meat over rice dishes we've had here were good.  The last three visits, however, were mainly for the ever-so-tasty durian shakes!  If you've never had durian, well, you're in for a ride of sensory overload!  Durian's scent for the uninitiated will most-likely be UNPLEASANT.  So overpowering is the durian's scent that many Asian countries ban its transport in public trains, planes, and automobiles.  Some hotels also will not allow patrons to store durian in their rooms!  Oh, but don't let its pungent smell deter you from trying it in shake-form!I suggest you ask for a second plastic glass and share this w/ a friend... Trust me-- it's too rich a drink to finish all by yourself!Dear Owner, why did you stop at 68? I suggest you adding one more number.  As we all know, the pho business is quite competitive, especially in this Asian mecca of town.  Survive on cheesy and perverted marketing, I say! ;-)Please redeem yourself, it's just embarrassing! Restore honor in the name of the Pho# community, which extends all the way to SoCal.  It was this 2-star recipe that I observed:1) Adding a dash of Black Pepper before my pho bowl arrives. Who does that? Trust me, nobody in my pho eating career have I seen this.  You either: a) believed your broth lacked flavors b) thought it was cool and tried to be different? If needed, we can use the shakers that was already sitting on the table. Clearly, a Pho Faux Pas.It threw everything off.  Slurp after slurp was quite painful.  The identity of the broth was more evident once I added the hoisin and siracha: bland-ish.  Hence the BP? *face palm*2) Empty Tables and Chairs.  Clearly, this was a dead giveaway but I was semi hopeful that the Pho Gods would bring me good tasting fortunes on this great Sunday afternoon. *face palm*3) SERVICE was so SLOOOOW, I thought at several points TIME itself had STOPPED.  In comparison to some legendary Viet places I know, I get my cup of water the second I sit down or atleast within reasonable time.  10 minutes before taking order, 10 more minutes for beverage to arrive. *face palm*If you are truly a Pho place, it shouldn't take you more than 10 minutes to deliver a bowl of Pho.  In fact, the vegetables took just as long to come out.  The anti-freshness did not help either! You would think being directly linked to an Asian Grocery would help in that regard.  *face palm*No excuse for slowness when the place is half full.Another thing, please invest in better Rooster and Hoisin sauces, not your mysterious, generic bottle.  *face palm*All of this face palming has caused my face to go numb! The only way I would return is if a ONE was added to the restaurant number.  By then I would expect an enhancement in the food and possibly a scandalous atmosphere. ;-)Sorry, not worth the 7 bones and something cents.  For now on, I will decide whether to risk my appetite by Factor #2. Sigh. Heed. Epic Fail. The End.

Technically speaking, this restaurant has everything a good restaurant in North Scottsdale should have: nice decor and ambiance, intriguing menu with lots to try, live music, and a good location.  After reading some stellar four and five star reviews on Yelp, we were pretty excited to try it out for dinner, however we found ourselves leaving sorely disappointed with both the food and the service.  Mistake #1:  Not a big crowd on a Friday night. Granted we did arrive a little later than the normal dinner crowd (8ish), but there were very few people eating here which was a little disconcerting.Mistake #2:  Had to wait over half an hour just to order, even though the place was empty.  Our waiter apparently decided to go on a smoke break (and we're not talking cigarettes here people) right when we sat down.  This left me no option but to go to the front and ask the girls why we weren't being served.  They apologized profusely and got our waiter out to our table in a few minutes. Mistake #3:  The food was not that great.  We ordered two small pizzas, two appetizers (baby back ribs and stuffed bell pepper) and pork tenderloin cooked to medium.  The pizza's both were cold and tasted like cardboard and the pork tenderloin was a little on the tough side, definitely not cooked medium.  The appetizers were okay, but for all the food that we got, we both left ready to snack when we got home since we didn't finish our less than spectacular meal.I will say that the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was pleasant, but those are about the only redeeming qualities I can find in this restaurant.  We will surely not go back to Javino's for the simple fact that there are an abundance of restaurants in Scottsdale alone that offer the whole package in the dining experience without compromising the service or the quality of food.  Nice try though.... 2.5/5.Met some colleagues for drinks here the other night.  We were having a good time, then all of a sudden at 8:45 pm our server comes over to tell us that it was last call.....what?!  Yep, last call because they close at 9 pm.......you gotta be kidding me?!  What is this?!Oh well, we paid and we left.Return Factor - 10%

Ring Ring...."Good Morning, 24 Carrots, This is Sasha... how can I help you?"Me: "What is your soup today?"Sasha: "Well, I haven't made it yet; what sounds good to you?"WHAT! A business owner actually asking her customers what THEY want??? Incredible! What is even more incredible is that Sasha put up with my continuing barrage of questions, emailed me the most updated menu, and allowed me to order through email since 11 of us at the office wanted to give 24 Carrots a try.Sasha did an amazing job of meeting our needs, and even labeled each of the to-go boxes and smoothies with our names! The greens and beans soup was OUT OF THIS WORLD, and I fell in LOVE with the "Triple Threat Acai" smoothie... so much so that I got it again the second day! I also got to try the black bean burger on a bed of greens and the masala burger. I really love that you get either baby carrots or corn chips with your sandwich!Everything is from local farmers markets and cooked to order. You can taste the quality in the food. I also really love that everything is pretty much vegan, and any cheese is added on after the fact.In addition to the black bean and masala burgers, the pita pizza's were also a really huge hit with my co-workers.A+++ all around!!In order to get a full scope of what Sasha has to offer, you need to pop in to 24 Carrots at least 3 or 4 times because there are so  many amazing things to try, you cannot get it all in a visit!Here are some of the major highlights: 1. Every day they make a homemade soup from scratch, and every single day it is amazing. The mashed potato, split pea, tomato basil, tortilla, and beans and greens are all DELICIOUS!2. The hummus is like out of this world good. It has an airy, fluffy quality to it and they will give you extra veggies instead of pita if you can't eat gluten.3. Sasha takes emailed orders,  updates her specials on the FaceBook page daily, and regularly interacts with her customers online. 4. The Food: Mediterranean Bean Salad, Chipotle Tofu Scrambler Tacos, Summer Fruit Crumbler, GF Pasta Salad, Veggie Marsala Burgers w/ Jalapeno Cilantro Pesto ... I could go on, and on, and on....I'm so stoked that she listens to her customers and is extending hours, adding new menu items (BLT!!!), and considering doing delivery! Whether you are vegetarian, vegan, laden with food allergies, or a regular Joe schmo.... there is something delicious waiting for you at 24C!If you want to go somewhere that you will be welcomed like family, remembered as a friend and valued as a customer then 24 Carrots should be your next stop.The Cafe is cozy and comfortable, I feel like I'm going over to a good friends house every time I stop by. You can sit and relax and share wonderful conversations, ideas and recipes with Sasha. If there is anything she can do for you she probably will, Sasha has the sweetest kindest spirit and it really reflects into her food. There couldn't be more love and passion put into her food if your grandmother made it. I've simply Loved everything I've ever ordered here. The menu has some solid choices but for me the magic lies in the daily specials. Everyday Sasha creates something new and exciting to tantalize your taste buds using fresh locally grown organic produce. You can follow 24 Carrots on twitter and facebook to hear what she's cooking up next.I'm pretty disappointed in myself for not reviewing 24 Carrots. Every time I've gone, I've had the best service! The employees already know my name, they make suggestions from the menu, and make sure you're happy.They like to experiment in the kitchen (as opposed to me, in the bedroom) and will bring out things they are working on. Beet Balls. Cake Balls. Yeah, they make a lot of balls. Score!The last time I went, I had the grilled cheese. To die for!!!!This is a vegetarian restaurant, with vegan options. You can get regular cheese if you want.I always get a blueberry smoothie. Large. Yummy & good for the kidney!Bring your laptop, as there is free wifi. There is no more perfect place to work. Believe me.I have never had an over-the-top and deliciously decadent breakfast that doesn't leave me feeling guilty, nauseated or sleepy afterwards.... until now.Victory was delivered in the form of carrot cake pancakes. They are, for lack of better terminology, the bee's knees. The butterfly's shins. The wasp's ankles. You get the idea. Two fluffy pancakes studded with thick carrot ribbons, spices, and a delicious dose of sweetness independent of the maple syrup and fresh fruit they were served with. These are better than carrot cake... and I don't consider too many things in this world better than carrot cake.On a very mildly unpleasant note, one cake was slightly undercooked in the middle. However, I have no fear of vegan pancake batter and proceeded to shove the entire thing in my mouth anyway. I washed that down with a "field of greens" juice (it tastes like it has the power to cure hundreds of ailments), and deemed myself full and satisfied.Then, I noticed a little sliver of pie sitting in the fridge. Just a sad, single sliver. I had to inquire.. it looked so lonesome. Turns out it was chocolate caramel turtle pie. Vegan, raw, gluten-free, chocolate caramel turtle pie with a nut crust, salted caramel sauce, pepitas and pecans on top. I don't need to explain what happened next, just know that it was beautiful. Worth every one of the 650 pennies I shelled out for it.It's been seven hours since I've eaten and I'm still not hungry. With the quality ingredients that 24 Carrots puts into all their dishes, it's no surprise that juice, two pancakes and half a slice of pie has sustained me until dinnertime. Oh, 24 Carrots, your wholesome goodness will surely lure me in again soon.

Nowhere inspires my wrath more than Tempe Marketplace, except maybe a Super Walmart parking lot. But I think they're building one of those here, too. Add in a Babies 'R' Us and you'd hit the slit-my-wrists trifecta.Kabuki would probably get three stars from me if it weren't located in the midst of this fakey-fake "urban experience" mall bullshit. But it is, so it doesn't.Plus, they make their iced tea with tap water and it tastes like shit. But coworkers looooove lunching at Tempe Marketplace. It's close to the office, and it's easy to drive and park there (never mind that we could walk to Mill Ave.) So OK, fine. I'm game, unless it's Maria Maria.I've been here twice -- once for lunch and once for happy hour. Well, we tried to go for happy hour. It ends at 6:00. Fuck you, too, Kabuki. I work too late for that bullshit. Next time I'll just go to Ra, where I might get severely injured eardrums from the ear-splitting club music bullshit. But at least they have cheap HH prices 'til 7:00. And they're on my drunk bus route home.I guess they were okay for a CHAIN, in a MALL.  Service was quick and even gave us free endame, I know, that's not much but it's something.  Just had a few rolls all of which were fine.  3 of the 4 rolls were about the size as a coffee cup, way too big for a humans mouth.  So what's a person do with rolls that are too big?Do you: A) Push the entire roll in you pie-hole and hope no food falls out when you start chewing.B) Cut up the roll with a knife and fork.C) Use your chopsticks to pick apart the roll into small bite size portions.Have your answer ready before you visit this place.Yelpers prove to be right yet again with the average 3 stars on this one... I was craving sushi and had a hot date with my sister-in-law last night to do dinner and a movie... It just so happened that Eat Pray Love was playing at the Tempe Marketplace Harkins Theater, so we decided to meet at Kabuki before the movie.  I walked in first and asked how long the wait was for two... I as told 10 or 15 minutes.  Not so bad... so I decided to wait.  I walked outside and met up with my Alexa and we came back in about ten minutes later... As we did so, two other women came in and I saw that they were seated right away.  I looked at Alexa, looked up at the hostess stand, was thinking (WTF), and then went and asked nicely where we were on the list.  "There are two tables before you," I was told.  "It will likely be another ten minutes or so." At that, I responded, "is there another option, perhaps sushi bar, that I don't know about?"And alas, there sure was... (they neglected to give me that option when I originally checked-in).  We were seated at the sushi bar at that moment and went on to have a very underwhelming meal.  Here's why:-While the large portion cucumber salads we ordered were extremely tasty, the cucumbers were cut lengthwise in such a way that it was difficult to eat.  I prefer cucumbers diced in smaller pieces so they are easier to eat!-Service - our waiter wasn't the friendliest... I felt kind of rushed by him when we were there.  Additionally, since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar, all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables, which was very distracting while we were eating!  Perhaps they could've moved the sushi ready for pick-up to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future?-The sushi itself was good; not amazing.  We had a Sunset roll, a Lotus roll, a Large roll, and an order of Ikura.  I didn't realize the Lotus roll was going to have a ton of mayo along with the baked Lobster that came on top of it... it was a bit on the creamy side for my liking.-To top things off, when the bill came, they overcharged us... a simple mistake, but given our experience, it was just one more negative thing... and then when I pointed it out, I barely got an apology at all.With so many other restaurants to choose from in the Tempe Marketplace, I am not sure I'll return to Kabuki.  If I do, however, I will wait for a regular table!It was a Friday night, my plans had changed and some friends told me to meet up with them for some Sake and Sushi, who can say no to that? So off I went!Ordered a few rolls for friend I to share, we went with the Vegas Roll, Lotus on Fire Roll and Sunkissed Roll.The Vegas roll was cream cheese, salmon, krab and avocado deep fired, it was good, just not my favorite, it's a textured thing I guess, not really into fired sushi, but my friend loved it.The Sunkissed roll was spicy tuna roll with salmon & sliced avocados on top of it, this was a great tasting roll.My favorite was the Lotus on fire, a California roll with spicy tuna & jalapenos & lotus root on top, delish! The perfect amount of heat too! Everything was fresh, and service was great too, and since Kabuki is practically in my back yard I am sure I will be back soon!Sadly  this isn' t as good the second time as the first time. The first time I was here the food seemed fresh and light and I really enjoyed a Volcano Sushi/ Tartare  dish .. mmmm  but this time ..what happened   ?The service was okay although for as empty as the place was , it seemed a  bit slow for refills and checking in. Akward sushi service , we were sitting at the bar and suddenly get  all our sushi at once on all different plates  ahhh  where do we put them , and no one has cleared our appetizer plates??? The rolls were big but sadly unmemorable.... something fried , something spicy tuna ish ,,blah blahdy  blah...  you get the picture. The good ole boys sitting next us were kind of fun to watch. They were singing country songs, while watching football , cramming too big of pieces of sushi in their mouths..It's not good when the slanted bathrooms are the most memorable part of your restaurant.  Doubt I 'll be back.Am glad my hubby liked his sushi, as I had one of the WORST restaurant experiences ever here.Our waitress was not exactly a firecracker, spoke very softly in a room full of loud bikers, and didn't seem in any hurry to help us.I am not a fish fan, but dearly love shellfish, so the grilled shrimp risotto sounded quite nice. Hubby's sushi arrived and he started in on it and was making nummy noises! When my plate of shrimp and risotto was tossed (literally) in front of me, I was expecting to be doing the same. Put a shrimp in my mouth and it was stone cold in the middle. Thought maybe this was a fluke, so went for #2. Not only was it even colder, but it had a funny taste and a fairly dry, rubbery texture.When the waitress returned, I asked if the shrimp was meant to be cold. She said no, and asked if I wanted her to get me another dish. I asked if the shrimp would be hot this time. She said yes, and took my dish. A few minutes later she returned with my original dish, risotto re-piled in the middle, with fresh greens and the remaining 5 shrimp from my first order. Shrimp were now warm, but VERY dry, rubbery and had a funny taste to them. When she returned again, I told her that the shrimp tasted funny and hubby showed her how dry they were. He asked if the shrimp had been frozen and she said yes. She returned a few minutes later to tell me that I was eating my meal incorrectly. Apparently, after 50 years, I am unable to dine in a restaurant without instruction! I was told that the shrimp were intentionally bland, because I was supposed to cut them up and stir them in with the flavorful risotto and sprouts. I advised her that the shrimp wasn't bland, it tasted funny, rubbery and dry. No response. No offer to get a different meal for me. Nothing. No adjustment was made to our check and my strongly worded letter to Kabuki will be for a full refund, no gift card, as I wouldn't be caught DEAD there again..Went here about 1pm on Sunday not very crowded and seated immediately. Menus and drinks followed. Service remained good throughout our visit. That's where the good stopped. The food?....well, let me just say this; "Don't waste your money!" Quality and quantity suffers greatly here. Nothing remotely Japanese at Kabuki only the name! Still hungry when we left and $35 lighter. No drink order either. The cooks here need to go to Japan to see how Japanese food is really crafted! I dislike having that feeling I just got ripped off. Dam!!!It's Monday night, I just got off work, I was kidnapped, and I was forced to join the little lady for Reverse Happy Hour at Kabuki.  You know it's a terrible Monday when I'm okay with being dragged to a chain sushi restaurant and I don't make a single snarky remark about how their menu is littered riddled with the usage of Papyrus.  I mean, Papyrus!  Who the heck designed their menus?  Must be someone from Collins College [This sentence is for Linh L.].Although I shiver at the thought of dining at chain sushi restaurants [I think my hatred stems with RA], I actually had a decent time at this Kabuki [Tempe Marketplace's Kabuki = no].  Our waiter was prompt and attentive, only disappearing for short-bursts of time when our food was in front of us.  We shared a small seaweed salad, a Vegas roll, an Alaska roll, a Shrimp Tempura roll, and we each had a Tokyo Mojito.  Our bill came out to be $40-something which isn't bad considering we were both full off our rolls and that deliciously refreshing mojito.  We probably could've done without one of the rolls but our eyes were hungrier than our stomachs.  Happy Hour, huzzah!The highlight of the night was watching some lady two tables away from us take her first bite of raw fish for the first time ever.  She promptly spit it up into her glass of water.  All that soy sauce and wasabi transformed her glass of water into L.A. Water.  I could go for another cocktail!I'll be back only for Happy Hour and a mojito.Perhaps it was the seriousness of the night and the topic the little lady presented me but I didn't have as an enjoyable time as I did last week.  No details, just quick notes mainly for myself:- Skip the Sauteed Mushrooms.  It's literally just white onions and mushrooms being sauteed in sesame oil and sesame seeds.  I could do this at home!- The Poke Tuna portion is ridiculously small.- No oysters until October.  Upon questioning why this is, no answer was given.  Boo.- Spider Roll:  Falls apart but not bad.  It's kinda of like trying to pick up tapioca with your chopsticks.  - Dragon Roll:  Too much unagi sauce, slightly small.- 10:15PM is when they turn on the lights and try to blind you out.  On the way out, you can watch the waiter counting their tips gleefully.  This made me laugh.- The mango Chu-Hi is really tasty though... even better than the Tokyo Mojito.  Cheers.$60 bill and only the cocktail was enjoyable.

Brand spankin' new chain food! This place is a tad different than the other ones around you wont find the giant horses out front here and its a very open layout inside with giant light fixtures that look like drums hanging from above. Its a good thing we don't have to worry about earthquakes here folks! The hostess was totally pleasant I wish I were young and enjoyed my job as much. Our waiter was excellent he knew his shit. My sister and I started off with their white pear Mojitos they could have been stronger but they weren't overly sweet and quite refreshing. We didn't have to replace the drink with water during the meal so we just kept the Mojitos flowing. We started w the seared ahi tuna I didn't care for the peanutty wasabi sauce that came on it next time I'd get it on the side it definitely had a kick to it. I had the Buddha's Feast, fried it was nothing special I probably wont order that again I could easily make that at home, the Shanghai Cucumbers were good like always. My sister had the orange peel chicken and was told by the waiter to eat the peels w the chicken she loved it and we both had leftovers to bring home at the end.They had $2 desert cups we had the strawberry shortcake and banana split both were very rich and tasty. We left very full and happy for our Sunday treat.

Free wireless and their sports bar are what lured us to this 24-hour neighborhood joint in Centennial Hills.  Great place to watch games.....and the only place nearby where I could watch NHL playoffs.  With 18 screens around the bar, and 22 monitors in the dining room area, I had the pleasure of watching some NBA and UFC as well.  They even have two more monitors in the mens bathroom (over the urinals), so I never would miss a goal or powerplay.  Not sure if there were screens inside the women's, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did!After a few visits, I've become a fan of their bar food as well.  With 14 "smilin to screamin" different sauces, we've only had four so far.   Their boneless wings were satisfying with their medium sauce.  But their honey BBQ sauce made their ribs and wings combo better than average.  Our last visit involved their mango habanero sauce on their tender, juicy ribs and perfectly cooked wings.  This screamin sauce (third from their hottest) had a nice flavor and kick to it.  Their hot BBQ sauce went well with the pulled pork slammers.  The pork was a little dry but full of flavor.For desserts, we've had the chocolate cake and cinnamon bites, which I highly recommend after the spices.  Both were served with ice cream, and were very refreshing.   This place is as good as it gets with excellent service, great atmosphere, and phenomenal food!I enjoy coming here for the FREE WiFi, food, & beer.  This particular location is the closest BWW to my house, so I frequent it the most.Today I went for the Sampler.....Nachos, Cheese Sticks, Boneless Wings, and Onion Rings....yeah baby!  I thought the sampler was excellent, except the Nachos which were just OK in my book.  I'm not a huge fan of their Cheese/Chili combo on the Nachos.Washed it down with an Apricot Wheat beer....went for the Ranger IPA next and then the other IPA they have on tap to end the day.The place isn't too busy in the middle of the day, so it was nice to have most of the bar area to myself.  The server was awesome and very helpful.Will I return?  Of course...I will be here often.I am convinced this BWW location on Durango, north of the 215 is the only west side BWW that offers good service.  Too many bad experiences, as noted in my reviews, about the other two west side locations.  And this is my 2nd review of this location that was a fantastic dinner experience tonight.Hostess sat us within 5 minutes of arrival at a nice booth with a fantastic server.Sarah was our server and she was personable, made great recommendations, the order was accurate and never had to ask for refills as she was always right there when the glass was half full. She definitely earned 20% tip!We ordered the potato wedges basket which was much larger, and a decent size, than a basket of french fries as ordered last time here.We ordered two large orders of wings, abut 20 wings per large order, total 40 wings. Sauces we enjoyed were Spicy Garlic, Parmesan Garlic, Asian Zing, Medium, Honey BBQ and Jammin Jalapeno.Plenty of different sports on the TVs and the restaurant was clean, including the restrooms.I bumped by previous 3 star rating to a 4 star rating.  Seems this restaurant is consistent with tasty food, cleanliness and good service. Look forward to patronizing this location again in the near future.I don't know what it is about this location, but it's not as good as the others.  I come here because a friend of mine comes here regularly, but I wouldn't come to this BWW otherwise.My last visit was this past Thursday evening.  I was waiting for my friend in the bar and wanted to order a Ranger IPA.  I was told they didn't carry IPA on tap or bottled.....WTH?  The other location on North Durango & 215 has two IPA's on tap.....I was there 2 weeks ago, so I know they carry it.  I asked the waiter if they recently stopped selling IPA's and he said he didn't know and didn't even know what an IPA beer was!  I settled on a 24 oz Newcastle and put away 4 or 5 before the night was over.Wow, I thought that BWW's were suppose to be consistent with their product.  I guess I was wrong.....whatever.Will I come back?  Only when I come to visit my friend, otherwise I wouldn't come to this location.  There are better BWW's in Vegas.Went to this Durango/Warm Springs BWW location tonight around 9pm. It was NOT packed and there were several tables vacant at this late dinner hour.Here's what we experienced in 7 to 8 minutes time frame...The hostess seated us in a booth directly in front of the kitchen entrance. In other words, impossible for servers to not pass our booth as it is less than 10 feet from enter/exit the only kitchen access. We looked at the menus, made our dinner decisions and put the menus down as a universal silent hint to servers that we are ready to order. We looked around the restaurant that was NOT that busy....We watched servers come & go from the kitchen walking inches from our booth, watched servers bus two tables away from us- but did not even make eye contact, let alone greet us, nor ask what we would like to drink/eat. After 7 long minutes without contact from any BWW employee, we got up and left.On the way out, I stopped at the hostess stand at the front entrance and expressed dissatisfaction regarding the unfortunate poor customer service. The manager on duty, wearing a red shirt, by the name of Geoffry looked up at me while I was speaking to the hostess and two other young ladies next to him, and asked if we were in booth 121. I asked what his employee position is and he identified himself as the restaurant manager.I said I didn't know the booth # we were seated at, however I described the booth as directly located in front of the kitchen entrance and mentioned to him that we were passed at least 2 dozen times by servers, but not one stopped to say hello, take our order, identify themself as our server, etc.Without even acknowledging my complaint, let alone apologizing for his staffs poor customer service; the manager walked away into the restaurant. The hostess watched him walk away from the apparently difficult situation and then said to me "I am really sorry for his lack of leadership." Clearly, Geoffrey is the reason why the servers get away with poor customer service.I was looking forward to eating some wings, checking out a few games, tipping 20% and offering a 5 star Yelp rating tonight, but how many stars are listed above?TIP TO BWW: Get rid of Geoffrey and offer better customer service to patrons!Oh gawd whenever I think about BWW's I cringe at the awful customer service I'm about to receive at the bar, no matter the location (9 times out of 10, service is awful). I also have to brace myself for freezing cold temperatures inside. Bring a jacket if you're always cold like me! For this particular visit, me and my husband met another couple at the bar. They were holding seats for us so we were able to right walk up and sit at the bar.I have never eaten a wing in my life, or at least not that I can remember. I've been a vegetarian for over 11 years and I don't plan on eating any wings in the future either! With that being said, dining at BWW's is a happy medium for me and my dude. Why? Because they have a token black bean burger for me, along with lots of other vegetarian options like flat breads, quesadillas, and your usual neutral appetizers while he gets his wings. Both parties are content! SCREAMIN' NACHO BURGER ($9.95?): I always order this with the black bean burger when I come to Buffalo Wild Wings. They used to have a black bean wrap but it's no longer on the menu. Fries are hit and miss. They're usually stingy with the fries. 3.5/5 SERVICE: Our waiter virtually ignored us. It was difficult to get his attention to order food and ask for refills even though he was standing directly in front of us at the bar. The other couple wanted to order a dessert but gave up because service was so slow. VIBE: There was a sports game on but I wasn't paying attention. It was loud inside and pretty busy. Worth a Return Visit?Probably not at this location since it's so far away from where we live. There are 3 other BWW's in much closer proximity, so it doesn't make sense to make the trek out here. Also, this location doesn't stand out at all. I'd rather get crappy service close to home.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #139

Review Text :
I am pretty open-minded about pizza. I prefer it with a pretty thick crust and no meat but will try it no matter what is on it. This weekend I was without a vehicle (but with my three kids) and not in the mood to make any more PBJs. I wanted somebody to bring me some food, but I was also not in the mood for pizza. I settled on Glass Nickel because their pizza is good and I'd get some nice pasta out of it (the salads sounded good, too, but I wanted some warm food). I was able to do my order online, which I LOVE (two reasons: I am antisocial, and there should be less chance of getting it wrong since I wasn't relying on somebody to listen closely and write down what I said). I was able to put the tip on my credit card, another good thing. One thing I wasn't aware of was the email updates. I got an email once the order was finalized and sent, then another one when it was being prepared and then a third when it was out for delivery. It was a cold Saturday night, but delivery was pretty darn fast. The delivery driver was your stereotypical friendly stoner, and he had his own pen! (I used to order delivery more often, and I was always surprised at how often the driver didn't have anything to write with). The kids enjoyed their pepperoni pizza and I loved my pasta (fettucine noodles with pesto sauce, broccoli, and mushrooms. The broccoli was pretty well shredded, but it tasted very good).

C'est magnifique!  C'est merveilleux! C'est ci bon!Well, not quite.Located at the Palazzo hotel http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=q_XliEMMc_vle_IYjdF3kQ, Morels is a nicely designed space, done in dark understated yet rich tones, accented by Murano chandeliers and Tom Cannon's enormous, in your face art, all of naked female form.  As an aside, Tom Cannon must be a real lover of breast implants.  Not one boob in his paintings looked natural.  I couldn't decide if it was art or more of a cartoon-type work, but as the idiom goes, "The boob is in the eye of the beholder".http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=hiLDnJAUR6o9vAEH_8BmVQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=aLI33JvcXjoe6vI-xbVvXQIt has a beautiful wine bar and a spacious comfortable terrace (which they call a patio).http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=2hBacW9b6INPycSDqY11GAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=aiZj8CkK1NSFhI7ujjQZ5whttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=YQlwdGgpkhjKjtErmQjuLgHere's a virtual tour:http://delivery.vrxstudios.com/50372/virtualtours.htm?id=386407&id_type=2&locale=1&container=1We were a group of 7.  Our table wasn't ready so we were offered to have drinks on the terrace.  As beautiful and comfortable as it is, if you don't care for the Las Vegas heat, you don't want to be there.  Maybe in February.  Some of us opted for the terrace, as for the rest of us - there was not really any other available place to wait.Once seated, we found our server Rick to be friendly and efficient.   I still don't like it when a waiter announces his name, especially in an upscale restaurant.  I've never heard anyone call "Hey Rick" at XIV.  Depending on people's age and preference, it's always either "Excuse me", "Waiter", or "Excuse me, Sir".  Why do I need his name?  I'm not planning on exchanging Christmas cards with Rick...  I ordered Onion Soupe Gratinee and 18 Hour Red Wine Braised Short Rib, which was a mouthful, even before I got any food.  My date shared a Petite Romaine Heart Salad, served tableside, for two or more, with a friend.  For the main course, he ordered Grilled Halibut.  Almost everyone else ordered Kansas City Steak and Choice Filet Mignon.  We already had cocktails, so we shared 2 bottles of Red, don't remember which, but I do remember that Rick said that decent wine starts at $75.00 a bottle at Morels...My soup was delicious, rich, full of onion and cheese flavors, and a good size.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=_k3UURyS2x98gCP0gEkl8gAs to Petite Romaine Heart Salad, I was told that it was good, but that Petite applied to the size of the salad instead of that of the romaine hearts...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=pUHu4Va2XWQiWft7sxzuDwThen came my favorite part of the evening.  Our entrees arrived.  It was like a beautifully orchestrated symphony.  Seven waiters plus waiters' assistants all descended on our table at exactly the same time.  Things were moved, knives were placed, glasses were repositioned, and all our seven entrees magically landed in front of usat the exact same moment.  Talk about food orgasm, this was service orgasm!My short rib was excellent, you could really appreciate the tastes embedded in it in 18 hours.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=GOnQcXc3tlm9SpNKq9fRqQMy date's halibut was OK, I was told, but it looked really tiny.  All side dishes are extra, by the way, so if you want a side of steamed asparagus, for example, that alone will knock you $14.00.  If you want a different sauce - that's extra too. Now to the steaks.  Of the 5 people who ordered them, 2 or 3 complained that the cut wasn't what it was supposed to be, that the beef was too chewy, and one complained of an overcooked steak.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=CIYQHfa3dExTAv4OMLw-ngTo make us feel better, we were comped two desserts for the entire table of 7 (a little stingy, considering, if you ask me).So, based on my food alone, it would have been 4 stars, but given the bad steaks in a steakhouse, and prices that I thought were too high, the most I can give is 3.  Knowing that I will be writing a review, I, very not ladylike, craned my neck to see what my date was paying.  Two entrees, two appetizers, and about half a bottle of wine (maybe a diet coke too) - around $200.00.Ouch.If you happen to go there on a cool evening, sit on the terrace, you'll have an amazing view of the Strip AND you can see the Sirens of Treasure Island show that's across the street and runs a couple of times a night.We came here last night because we needed to eat at 4:00 pm and wanted a great steak by the Palazzo Hotel.  Most of the high end steak houses do not serve till 5:00 pm.We walked around the hotel and bumped into this gorgeous restaurant that was OPEN!We went in, sat down on a fab table with a view of the strip and orderedescargot, french onion soup, lobster bisque, rib eye steak, filet mignon, rack of lamb, mushrooms, brocolli, scalloped potatos, and truffled mac and cheese.Each item that we tried was just outfuckingstanding!!!!!!!!French Onion soup, lobster bisque and escargot were soooo flavorful, I could of eaten those starters alone and left satisfied.The meats were cooked to perfection and soooooooo tender and juicy.The sides of mushrooms, potatos, mac and cheese, and brocolli with a  tangy hollandaise sauce complemented the meats like white on rice......The service was super-excellent...........!!!!!!!Toss in the incredible ambience and beautifully designed and furnished dining room and you have one of the finest restaurants that I have ever eaten at.Brunch here was one of the most amazing meals of my life! It was SO incredible! Our waiter was the sweetest guy and I loved starting the meal with a bloody mary prepared for me table side :) The waiter used all of the perfect ingredients and even muddled the garlic in the bottom of the glass! I ended up adding a little bit of A1 to make this the best bloody mary ever. For food, the waiter gave great suggestions. The croque monsieur was insanely delicious and came with perfect french fries. The waiter brought out their homemade mayonnaise with truffles for french-fry dipping and it was perfect too. The crab eggs benedict was also insane. I usually don't like hollandaise sauce but this hollandaise was delicious. The crab meat was so succulent and perfect.Then, there was the special mac and cheese with blue cheese, truffles, and more. It was so rich and perfect! The restaurant is super classy and the sexy paintings on the wall are pretty cool too.I cannot wait to come back here and expect to visit during every future Vegas trip (which I expect will be a lot of trips! ;) )Thank you Morels for being UNBELIEVABLE!!!Never say never, apparently.  I'll put this back on a list of places I'll go again and a place that you should go.  Under new general management!!!4ish stars for food/atmosphere/etc.5 stars for serviceFull disclosure: this was the "let us make it up to you meal."  Constantin, the new general manager, saw my review on Yelp and contacted me to apologize for my terrible experience (the first true apology I received, mind you) and wanted us to come back so he could make it up to us and show us how Morels has changed.  He seemed very earnest and I'm fairly open minded, so off to Morels we were!Constantin came right over after we were seated to say hello and thank us for trying them out again.  He briefly explained the menu he had planned for us and introduced Matt, our server.  Honestly, Matt seemed a bit nervous at first; I think he was concerned that we were super snotty or something, but after we chatted him up, he calmed down quite a bit and opened up a lot.  He was a good server and a cool guy! On to the food:Amuse Bouche: Fresh Crab Salad on a homemade truffle potato chip.  Crab was excellent and the mixes of textures and salty/savory was great!Oysters: Yummy Kumamotos; super good, as would be expected.(There are wine/champagne pairings in here, but I dont recall what they were; they matched wonderfully though!)Appetizer: Chef's Prime Beef Tenderloin Tartar: omg so good!  The quail egg and truffle chips were an excellent complement to the quality beef. I normally wouldn't order beef tartar, but I would order this again!Iron Cast Roasted Branzino: I was very impressed with this dish.  I'm not a huge cooked fish person, but I recently tried the branzino at Angelini Osteria in Los Angeles.  Angelini is a favorite of mine but I only tried the fish because Wolfgang Puck praised it on Best Thing I Ever Ate.  It was alright.  The branzino here at Morels was so good; cooked perfectly, nicely moist, and served with a nice beurre blanc.  Petite Cut Filet: Pretty good.  I enjoyed the quality of the meat and the preparation.  There is an interesting cumin-based rub they use that might scare off some diners; I liked it but it did overpower some bites for sure.Our favorite cheesemonger, Jake (who is now a server) came by to see if we had any preferences and proceeded to hook us up with some amazing cheese.  Matt then had the gall to bring us dessert!!! I can't recall the name but it had some fresh fruit and a meringue mixture.  I'm not doing it justice, but it was a nice bite or so. I was far too full!Before he left for the night, Constantin came to check on us one more time.  He was the consummate gentleman and totally made up for our previous experience.  While I 100% stand by my previous review, I'm sorry that we experienced Morels at such a down point (with the previous manager) and thought so poorly of the restaurant for so long.  Thanks Matt for being a great server! And, thank you to Constantin for having faith in us as customers to know good service and food when we see it.  We're very excited to go back!Very friendly service but that's about it.  They clearly have no idea what they are doing...from the servers, to the bartenders, to the chefs....it was a debacle from start to finish.  How does prime real estate at one of the nicest casinos in vegas survive such utter incompetence.  They screwed up pretty much everything we ordered..mojitos without muddled mint, overcooked mussels, a souffle left in the oven about 20 min too long, the bussers couldn't figure out how to light the fondue.  Total nincompoopery from start to finish.   The only thing keeping them from receiving a single star is they were so nice.  But nice only gets you so far.We enjoyed a relatively late new year's eve dinner (10:00pm).  The top reasons I made reservations for Morels a couple of weeks before were:1. Proximity to the strip.  It's right by the Palazzo entrance.  Easy for us to run out and see the fireworks in 30 seconds.   2.  They were serving the a la carte menu unlike a lot of other restaurants that night doing some $250+ per person prix fixe bs.  I'd rather just do the full meal deal at Joel Robuchon instead paying that kind of money for overpriced NYE menus at Comme Ca, Koi or holy crap god forbid Sugar Factory.  3.  STEAKOur starters were the "Onion Soup Gratinee" and the "Pan Seared French Rougie Foie Gras".  The soup was a 3 out of 5.  We prefer our onion soups a little more robust and wine flavored where this was kind of sweet.  It was a hearty portion as it should be for $10 but not worth ordering again.  The foie gras on the other hand was deeeeeelicious.  It was accompanied by caramelized red onion, candied apples and balsamic reduction.  There's just something about the fatty and unique flavor of the duck liver with fruit that I can't get enough of.  Restaurants in Vegas like Andre's and Gordon Ramsay Steak do it really well and this was right up there.  For the entree, we chose not to mess around and just went with the 32 oz porterhouse for two prepared rare.  They served it tableside and it came with roasted rosemary potatoes, fricassee of baby turnips, sauce Bordelaise, onions & carrots.  We asked to keep the bone as always either in hopes of being ambitious a few days later and using it to make beef noodle soup at home or just gnawing at the bone while walking down the street like a couple of insane canines later in the evening.The steak was very good.  32 oz is a monster cut and we were only able to finish half and box the rest.  I actually preferred the sirloin side over the filet this time around which was kind of surprising for me.All in all a very solid choice for steak but still not close to the best steaks in their own building thanks to Mr. Batali and Mr. Puck.  I would come back here for happy hour and also when it's warmer to dine outdoors.Terrible. Food and service.I have been to just about every strip steak place and this is hands down my least favorite. And not just by a little bit, by a rather large margin.I love steak and I love French so this should have been a match made in heaven, perhaps how much I looked forward to going here tainted my view but it was so bad it can't all have been my bias. Just look at my review record- I have enver given 1 star to anything else- I am a pretty soft judgeFirst- my reception.I had just spent an inordinate amount of time playing poker at the Venetian. As such I was not dressed super formally- khaki shorts, polo shirt, tennis shoes- more than acceptable for vegas lunch. This is on a Weds about 230pm. The host ( a dude) ignores me for about 5 minutes while he is on the phone than finally, reluctantly, brings me to a table. It is then about 20 minutes before I see my waiter. During this wait I am drinking some water and happen to empty my glass. The water guy comes up and starts pouring the water before the pitcher is over the glass and misses the glass for a solid 3 seconds soaking the entire table and myself before he notices. I ask to move to a dry table. He tells me "maybe". At this point I look around, I am one of 6 people in the entire place. Eventually I get moved.My OrderI try to get the exact same thing my first time at every steak house here for comparison- bone in ribeye, potato side, tartare. The waiter comes up to my table and I try and get my order in as quickly as possible since I have already been waiting. me: "Tenderloin Tartare, Bone in ribeye medium rare, potato dauphinois"him: would you like to hear about our specialsme: nohim: well then what would you likeme: Tenderloin Tartare, Bone in ribeye medium rare, potato dauphinoishim: im not sure we have thatme: which parthim: uh... the potatoit only went downhill from there. He didn't write anything down, came back twice to ask to clarify, and then brought tuna tartare. The tuna was actually the highlight of the day.The SteakI like steam rare to medium rare. That being said, I will eat just about anything. The steak that was brought to me was not even grey, it was so dark grey throughout I doubted if it was actual meat. It looked like an overcooked mcdonalds hamburger inside. I first cut a piece off the end and decided to give them the benefit of the doubt- maybe it wasn't like that in the middle. It was. Now, a quick note about me. I don't really ever send food back. I'm a gambler and I think ordering food is sort of a gamble- in this case I gambled and lost. Also, if a kitchen has already screwed something up I don't have much faith in them fixing it so generally I just let it go.And that is what I planned to do here. So my waiter comes back and says "how is everything". The following conversation ensuesme: The steak is way overcooked, its inedible, can I get my checkhim: It looks fine to meOk, thats annoying. Still, never argue with stupid people right...me: just the check pleasehim: I'll bring that right out15 minutes later the waiter comes back with another waiterNew waiter- I'm sorry sir, we cannot send that back, it looks medium rare to me. At this point I am flabbergasted. Was I getting punked? Could I actually be eating in a professional restaurant? Let alone a nice one in Las Vegas? Could anyone working in a steakhouse for longer than 3's of minutes think this was medium rare?me: I'm not trying to send it back, I just want my checkAnother 10ish minutes go by and I get my check. I choose to pay by way of the credit card. I put it in the little wallet thing and stand it up so all can see the card sticking out of it. At this point I look at my watch and think to myself "how long could this take". Turns out quite a while. After another 10 minutes I look around and I can't see any other customers in the place. I take my check and walk to the front where the host and 3-4 waiters are sitting in the bar area. I ask my waiter to run my card which he sighs and then does. Also, they charged me for the tenderloin tartare which is 1 dollar more than the Tuna....I then walked outside across the street and ate at stripburger.In closing, Carne Vino greater than MorelsAmazing quiche!I want to take a moment to focus on the quiche Lorraine here......................AMAZINGIt's buttery, salty from the bacon, sweet from the caramelized onions, flaky and so damn great. No joke the best I've had in this city. I've also lived in Paris many years ago and I fondly remember gaining 20 pounds in just six months over quiche Lorraine there! The restaurant is beautiful with a bistro feel that has very sexy art all over the place and our waitress was kind enough to give me a few postcards with the artists info who is Tom Cannon. The art is perfect and they also have a beautiful outdoor space that overlooks Las Vegas Blvd. The food is really great here and did I mention they have quiche Lorraine? Ok let's get through this and the highlights without losing my focus. The tuna tartare was fresh and light. The cheese fondue was decadent and fun to dip & eat. The crab omelet my friends ordered was fluffy and delicious and my quiche was out of this world. I remember every bite...:)We also received complimentary dessert which was a pleasant surprise. Thank you for the delicious profiteroles with warm chocolate sauce! The service was on point and we came over on a weekday for a business lunch and luckily had the place to ourselves. This however worried me because this place should be popular. I have had dinner at this location before but we didn't have a fantastic experience due to waiting too long even with reservations but this lunch experience was perfect.After eyeing this place for some time, Diane selected Morels for her birthday dinner.  It was our first time here but will not be our last..We were initially presented with a salty Olive Tapenade, butter with Hawaiian Sea Salt, and delicious soft warm rolls.  Quickly following were Wild Caught Prawns that were cold and meaty, and a Horseradishy Cocktail Sauce.  My other preliminary course was a crock of excellent sweet Onion Soup Gratinee with a large and well-deconstructed crouton and well-melted Comte and Gruyere Cheeses.Both of us then enjoyed the night's featured Surf & Turf Special of Filet and Half-Lobster.  We each received a very nice lobster half and a nicely seasoned 8 oz. Filet with little char cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered.  The lobster meat was sweet dipped in either drawn butter or specially requested Buerre Blanc, and ran out just a few bites ahead of the Filet.  Excellent whipped Mashed Potatoes accompanied the combo entree.  Three flavored sea salts were also provided: Black Hawaiian Sea Salt, Smoked Black Sea Salt, and Red Hawaiian Sea Salt.We finished with very good Classic Profiteroles served with Candied Vanilla Almond Ice Cream and Malted Chocolate Sauce.  I just wish there had been more ice cream.Our booth back was hard but seating was otherwise comfortable, with a nice cushioned bottom.  Sensually appealing fine art adorned several walls.Service was excellent except for tea sweeteners initially being removed prematurely.  Chamomile Decaf Iced Tea was specially made for me, with needed refills quickly supplied without request.  The dining room was not that crowded on a Saturday night.                 In sum, we found Morels to be an upscale dining venue with a nice classy ambiance, fine food, and excellent service!Located off the lobby of The Palazzo and, as such, easily missed by those visiting the property who are not checking in, Morels could easily be seen as the "third option" steakhouse in a resort complex housing Carnevino as well as Delmonico, but a close look shows several differences, a leisurely breakfast or brunch on the outdoor patio providing a great opportunity to take them all in, particularly the city's greatest cheese selection.Part of a small group, another location found at The Grove in Beverley Hills, Morels spins French on the traditional "big meat" concept and going so far as to produce their own wines a glimpse at the interior speaks to the grand brasseries of Central Europe with large nudes hung on walls and an airy, spacious layout while an oyster bar sits up front to tempt those without time or interest for a table within.Sitting with two friends and a trio of children at a spacious table of three two-tops fit together overlooking the sunny 9:00am Strip below, it was admittedly as guests of the house that a sizable meal was taken, the feast essentially comprised of four courses with children's orders thankfully taken first as two-hours of restaurant rumors and banter proved a challenge for all but the 2-year old, the staff doing an admirable job of expediting plates...and an even better one of trying to clear space for what was decidedly too much food.Perhaps not going to the lengths of Batali or Lagasse in terms of meat sourcing or buying produce from the very best purveyors around, suffice it to say that those interested in coffee are well advised to elect service from French Presses featuring roasts from Equator, for although priced at $5-7 per person depending on the bean the quality offered from Thomas Keller's preferred brand are easily the best in Sheldon Adelson's complex, particularly with free refills arriving promptly as cup-after-cup was downed.Offering Mimosas and Bloody Marys mixed tableside it is with pillowy beignets that each brunch at Morels begins, and although granulated sugar would better be replaced with the powdered stuff of New Orleans the oilless donuts proved quite light, as did the leafy greens dressed in fruit and balsamic with a great kick added by Laura Chanel's ever creamy chevre.Attempting to sample a good variety of items, rather than just focus on obvious 'breakfast hits,' it was with four savories ranging from sandwiches to benedicts that meal marched on and although the picked crab crowned with a perfectly poached egg was unfortunately overwhelmed by a touch too much lemon while a steak requested 'medium' was tender and tasty despite being served nearly blue atop a bed of sauteed onions, both the chicken sandwich and risotto were exceedingly well executed - the former particularly intricate with the nuttiness of Comte playing nicely off peppery arugula bathed in buttery Mornay.Assuredly taking the opportunity to explore a recently updated carte du fromage, something Morels would be well advised to emphasize both at the tableside and in advertisements around the resort, it was with a great deal of effort that selections were limited to a mere ten options and weaving a wide swath of beasts, countries, and textures one would be hard pressed to make a single bad choice - the aged Canadian Cheddar particularly on-point while both the creamy Brie and Stilton-Sandwich Huntsman were equally well selected, palates rejuvenated between bites by candied walnuts and date paste made in house.Never one to skimp on sweets, though admittedly a bit disappointed that nearly half the desserts are unavailable at brunch (as is the cheese fondue,) it was still in pancakes, French toast, and a lovely rustic tart that the afternoon concluded, the Pacojet crafted quartet of ice creams exceedingly rich and creamy with the marshmallow studded lightness of lemon meringue the best amongst the crowd.***Neither trying nor succeeding in any way to steal the thunder of other Steakhouses within the Venetian/Palazzo complex, Morels is better appraised as an upper/mid-range option to be celebrated for its differences, the early opening hours offering a significant upgrade on Grand Lux in terms of service or setting while the fromage, coffee, and ice cream are Strip-side second to none.

Restaurant name  Pete's Fish & Chips
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Every once in a while Pete's can kind of hit the spot... but I'm not quite as crazy about it as some locals seems to be. The fish and chips are good and cheap; and their special sauce is pretty damn tasty... but I usually leave feeling a little fishy and greased out. The fish is perfectly square, and I can't help but wonder why they do it that way... because it really gives off a 'store bought' vibe. Compare this to somewhere like Fulton Fish Fry in Vegas which has fresh pieces of fish that each kind of form their own twisted and unique shape... it just feels more authentic that way. This just feel like a fish patty that could have been taken out of a McDonalds Filet-O-Fish and thrown in the greaser.So what I gotta say about Pete's is this: only go if you're craving some no-frills fish and chips; and if you have such a craving you'll probably leave happy... if however you are looking for something to make your taste buds shiver with excitement, then look elsewhere. Oh yeah... one last thing... their whole sense of entitlement really gets on my nerves sometimes. Having kooky rules at a restaurant is fun, but it only works if that restaurant is serving up magnificent food. Here you are getting average food and they try to make you feel like they are the Gods of Fish and you must bow down and obey their every command if you want to get served (like their whole "no ketchup-don't even ask" thing). You better be careful Pete's or you may find people are gonna find somewhere else with better food, that doesn't hassle you if you ask for ketchup. Meh.

This restaurant is in the Amherst street area, reminiscent of Hollywood in LA or the Castro in SF. It is a mixed neighborhood of small shops, restaurants, with several Asian and Gay establishments with a couple of seedier adult video stores on cross streets. The restaurant has been here for 20 years, first owned by a Japanese national, who sold it to a Vietnamese family. It has Japanese decor, with a small sushi bar with 2 chefs. All staff are Vietnamese. Mr. Ho is the head sushi chef, and he escaped from Vietnam on a boat in 1980. Turns out 95 percent of the Sushi establishments in Montreal are Vietnamese, Chinese, or Korean owned. This includes the nearby Yuki sushi (2 locations in the same area) which is Chinese owned and not as good. The sushi was pretty good. I had Nigiri Sushi, including Hamachi, Maguro, Saba, Sake and Uni, with a bowl of Miso Soup. All the Nigiri were moderately priced from $4 - $5, even the uni at only $5.75 CAD. The staff was friendly, especially after they found out I knew they were Vietanamese and we talked about Vietnam experiences. They speak French, English and Vietnamese. No Japanese, however!

My first trip was for lunch. My waiter sold me on the Lunch Special (fried shrimp and crab cakes with pineapple salsa, (see pics)$ 15 But I Love quiche so I had to order that too (see pics) $10 Thank God I ordered both, these were smaller than appetizers, I was told that Lunch had full size portions? O well I guess~ at least it was really good.~ Although I did have a problem with the shrimp, it tasted like cleaner, they brought me a couple more crab-cakes instead. side note*= tables have no salt, pepper or sweeteners, I ordered an ice tea and still was not offered any sugar.Second trip Brunch= I had already made reservations for brunch prior to my first visit. So here we are again no salt and pepper or sweeteners, there was 3 of us and only two table setting up until right before our food came out. Ordered Ice tea and still had to ask for sweeteners. What we ordered: Ham and biscuits=Fresh Baked Biscuits, Virginia Ham, Poached Eggs, Champagne Hollandaise (see pics) $12The "ham" was not ham but extremely cheap and salty prosciutto, I put it aside, the rest was quite good although rather tiny. I informed the waiter , he comes back with the chefs apologies and some lame excuse saying "well its American prosciutto that's why we call it ham" WTH the menu says Virginia ham? Virginia Ham Monte Cristo=Edwards and Sons Ham, Sourdough French Toast, Swiss Cheese (see pics) $11. Very Good, probably the best thing between us all and it had the ham that it described. Sunny Side Up Eggs=Organic Eggs, Smoked Bacon, Hash Browns (see pics) $9This was not on the kids menu by the way and very sadly it was served with Denny's hash-browns, this is a fancier restaurant shouldn't those be taboo?? Buttermilk Pancakes=House-made Butter, Fig and Peach Syrup (see pics) $10They tasted good but that does not make up for the fact that they were served with NO BUTTER and COLD SYRUP and a little burnt as you can see!!!Let me sum it all up for you: Ham and biscuits................. $12Virginia Ham Monte Cristo.....$11Sunny Side Up Eggs............$9Buttermilk Pancakes...........$10 Having to go somewhere else for breakfast after brunch..........PRICELESS!!! I really have mixed feelings about this place, because the food is quite good but really overpriced for the portion size. I mean I do go to a restaurant to EAT for God's Sake!It might be cheaper to invest in a Lap Band Surgery than to try and go here and get full.I have to go with 2.5 starsI could have been happy with just the homemade cinnamon doughnuts, the cold Bellini's, and the table conversation but after looking at their special Easter brunch menu I knew there would be more to come. Cork had a variety of classics to choose from that were seasonally inspired and well thought out. I'm grateful to have friends and family who are willing to share because if it weren't for their generosity I would have had to order several dishes.There were plates of thick slices of pecan and raisin French toast with warm sautéed bananas and organic maple syrup passed around for everyone to try. Forks full of bourbon and honey glazed ham that, at least twice, made its way around the table. There were also spoons full of tangy and bright champagne hollandaise and perfectly poached eggs that everyone tried. One of the many great attributes that Cork has going for them is their passion for the customers. Hands down some of the best service I've had in the valley. Just to give you an idea how good they are- we were greeted by the chef, it's nice to know people who know people, the server was more excited about the menu than I was, and the owner thanked us for sharing Easter with them. We liked them so much that we made reservations in a private room for the end of the month. If I weren't so far away from them I would probably ask them for a personal napkin.Cork is an enigma.What makes it enigmatic is how damn good it is... Too good for Chandler and maybe too good for the valley.The portions are just right, and anybody that tells you otherwise is a fat ass or a glutton (I'm 6'3, 200lbs. and I was satisfied).  If you want large portions though, go to their lunch/brunches.  I've been there twice and had The Lamb Chop, which was amazing on all levels, and I've had some serious lamb in rural Bosnia, which has been labeled the best in their country... sure enough cork's stood up blow for blow.  The other entrée I experienced was the buttermilk fried chicken.  I was so amazed by the lamb the first time, that I had to try something more "simple" in order to qualify their food in regards to regular places.  Let's just say the chicken was not regular, it was outstanding.  The appetizers are crazy good... can anyone say king crab legs?The wine selection is top notch.  the booze selection is killin, and they even make this amazing Italian lemon stuff that's like 90% alcohol.  make sure you have a designated driver, because this place will inspire winos and boozers to indulge to their fullest.Go to Cork, because it's that damn good!10/29Met Violeta H. for happy hour.  Loved the atmosphere here!  Warm shades of amber and gold, and textures of cork, wood, and metal married beautifully.  It was only later, when presented w/ paybooks that looked and felt like cork, that I noticed that the floor tile was made to look like cork!  Cunning, this, I thought.  [In our excitement to finally try Cork for the first time, I'd neglected to tell V. that Andrea K. might try to join us later on (and later still, Andrea's friend Brynn!)].Violeta and I started our most enjoyable evening by ordering champagne.  Hers was flavored w/ Kir (cherry liqueur) and mine w/ St. Germain elderflower.  It was very good, and soon it was time to order another; Violeta ordered more of the Kir, and I, impressed that she found it so great to order it again, ordered one myself.  Unfortunately, I didn't find it as agreeable, so I asked if it could be replaced with a Bellini, instead.  No problem.  This version went down smoothly, albeit too smoothly (and way too fast!), as it was much sweeter than the elderflower.  For my third flute, I went back to my original choice (if only to make the drink last longer!).  Violeta and Andrea later tried the elderflower and liked it.For our "entree," I ordered the Prime Better Burger, cooked medium, while V. ordered the grilled cheese.  My burger was decadent: bottom layer consisted of 4 oz. prime burger w/ aged cheddar, and topped w/ 4 oz. shortrib, w/ garnishes of wild mushrooms, sun-dried tomato, and aioli.  Violeta's grilled cheese was equally wicked- slices of Granny Smith apples, bacon, and brie encased in toasted cranberry-walnut bread!  While I enjoyed my burger, I found it too indulgent; I'd definitely order the grilled cheese, in a heartbeat!I think I was in the middle of finishing my entree when Andrea joined us, and may have offered her a bite, which she may have liked so much, that she ordered a burger for herself.  Such a shame that her burger, ordered medium, came out more on the rare side... I was able to talk Andrea into trying the arancini with me after failing miserably w/ Violeta :o  I thank the heavens Andrea played along, because the arancini was freakin' amazing!  Andrea and Brynn would agree!  A clear highlight of the evening.  Tonight's flavor was Marconi almond pesto.  The menu stated that the flavors change daily.  Cannot wait to return and try a new version!For dessert, Violeta ordered a sorbet trio (which I thought was a bit on the safe side; I like rich desserts!), while I asked for banana creme pie.  Beautiful presentation!  What first struck me were the banana slices- these four pieces were given the torch treatment a la creme brulee.  Loved the amber color!  Then, the white and dark chocolate cigarettes propped onto the generous mound of toasted marshmallow!  Mmm... Every slice of the fork into the pie yielded a perfect ratio of mallow, banana cream, and graham cracker crust... Even the long, narrow river of chocolate sauce in the middle was just enough to add yet another level of exquisiteness to this dessert! If you like bananas, you owe it to yourself to visit soon and order this!  What an amazing meal shared with fantastic women!  Thank you V and our new friends Andrea and Brynn!  To top the evening off, owner Robert sent us a round of late harvest Gewurtztraminer!  Funny, I was the only one who finished a pour...12/18/09How I LOVE this place!  The grilled cheese gets me everytime!  I'll even get cheesy (pun intended!) and borrow a few words from a popular Cowboy Ciao quote- This dish is so good, it makes me want to get naked and roll in it!  The "orangini" that night (chicken and risotto rolled together, deep-fried, then set on an marcona almond pesto) was just-OK.  Nothing to write home about.  I think I'm done w/ arancini... maybe not.  I think it was the chicken that turned me off.  Still ate both pieces, though.  Oh, but the grilled cheese!  BTW, I met a couple of friends here, who, just like me, fell in love w/ the St. Germain elderflower champagne and red wine!  Thanks for another great afternoon, Cork!I first read about this place in the Phoenix New Times and I take my wife there on occasion. We like coming here for dessert, after eating somewhere else. Their take on banana cream pie is exquisite. But it seems with every time we give this eatery our patronage, the service gets worse and worse.Cork's version of banana cream pie is awesome. Elegant and tasty. But having a meal here is a different story, and after only trying the food one time, I won't ever do it again. The one time my wife and I ordered food from Cork, it was only out of curiosity and was following meal at another place; thus we only wanted something light before ordering the banana cream pie, so we each got an appetizer. I got the plate of meat, cheese, and crackers; and she got a salad. Both dishes were lean on the helpings, and though I've come to just expect it from Cork, I find the portions a bit annoying for what you pay. (I've seen what other patrons order as well, and see the cost on the menu. Geez.) Anyway, my appetizer was good for what it was, and the wife was satisfied with hers as far as taste went. But the turn-off was with the waiter through the entire time. First, he acted very irritated when we only ordered water and not wine, and was very condescending with us wanting only appetizers to precede our pie. ("Usually people order a MEAL with an appetizer." WTF?) The kicker was when he made snarky comments about me paying cash instead of using my card. What, dude? When I have $35 in my pocket, is the place really too ritzy to pay the check with cash? That was a new one.If my review were based solely on what our personal Cork staple is (the banana cream pie,) then it'd get 5 stars. But between the minimalist yet expensive portions and the up-nosed, elitist attitude of our waiter, I just can't give it even an average rating. From now on, we only come to Cork for dessert. Seems like the wait staff won't turn into divas when you do that.Peculiar.

Look, I don't have a problem with the concept. Bring on the fun and sexy girls in lingerie. I'll eat crappy food, I'll put up with bad service, I probably won't even notice the dirty restaurant. But if that's your thing, if fun and sexy girls are your gimmick, you better make damn sure your girls are fun and sexy. Which the girls at Fantasy Grill are not. So what have you got when you remove fun and sexy girls from the equation? Crappy food, bad service and a dirty restaurant. F'in gross, man. Stay away.

We get there. Reservations for six at 6. Half our party is there, half is on it's way. We tell them we're here. Can't sit until the whole parties there. I get that. But then the hostess adds "we have a party at 8 PM that's sitting at your table and you'll have to leave by then." I get that, sometimes you gotta hustle.We sit at 6:15 with our whole party. Our server comes up without even a GREETING and says, "we have another party sitting here at 8 PM, so you'll have to be done by then." I don't get that....That was just a little too much! I've never been anywhere that was so blatant about getting you outta there asap. I understand you've got to move people in and out, but don't tell us when we haven't even ordered a thing and are planning on spending money in your establishment! Even with taking our time we were done at 7:45 PM. Plenty of time to clean off the table for this important party. Too bad because the food was good. The service left a little to be desired...

Well my Mr turned 40 today and what better way to show my love then to take him out for a nice dinner for 2. Well as you can see by my rating this went horribly wrong very fast.***** The space at Fines is modern comfort. Comfortable with long oversized banquets.. ball chain screen and cool stained concrete floors that looked like suede. We were sat off a 7pm reservation immediately. We both noticed that the patio was hopping.. great for a new local business. We ordered a couple of glasses of wine from the host and loved the selection from that menu as well as the food menu.**** We waited for some time until our glasses of wine were brought to our table. The person delivering was apparently our server. She never asked how we were.. told us her name.. just dropped the wine off and asked if we were ready to order. We placed our order and took in each other. The wine was very good and the space comfortable. Our apps came out in pretty decent time and we dug in. I had the calamari and the Mr had the BLT.. both were pretty good though mine should have had less salt. Otherwise the food paired with our wines quite well.***Waiting for our plates to be cleared we felt that maybe we weren't that important. The host guy was fawning over 2 tables with champagne service as well as sports scores for the table next to us. Service is a pretty big deal to me and can pretty much ruin an evening. Finally our plates were cleared and salads brought out some time after that. I had the Arancini and the Mr had the grilled radicchio salad. Both were prepared well and pretty tasty. We also ordered 2 more glasses of wine which came out pretty quickly. Then we were done and we waited once again.. and waited.. and waited.**Meanwhile the server assistant came and took our plates. I also asked where my new glass of wine was I had ordered at the beginning of the salad course. The assistant went to the bar and grabbed my glass of wine and was intercepted by our server who then snatched it from her hands. She then tossed her hair and brought me the glass. Now we had no silverware.. no water and a glass of wine. Then we waited and waited again.*Finally after 35 minutes our server told us the kitchen was backed up and that the entrees would be out in 5 minutes. We told her fine if it was only 5 minutes. We waiting this long, whats another 5 minutes? 5 minutes passed, then another 5, finally I called her over and asked for the check. She said the entrees were coming up soon I told her just the check please. She asked if we wanted them boxed. I told her sure. She brought the check out, 150 bucks.. I paid and left her only 10% which was VERY generous.. she brought the boxed entrees which we left on the table and stormed out.As you can see the Mr birthday dinner was squashed.. I got mad and paid to much for food we didn't eat. So much for an awesome dinner for his birthday. Now I feel embarrassed, let down and of course sad that I didn't show my man a good time on his once 40th birthday.What a real shame to what could have been a great place muddled by horrendous service. "The valley's premiere wine/dine destination".. yeah keep trying to believe that!Fine's Cellar is offering 50% off their entire food menu on Mondays until June so we had to check it out last night.  We ordered 3 apps: duck confit bratwurst w/sauerkraut, mac & cheese trio (blue cheese, truffle oil, peas & pancetta), pigs in a blanket (pork belly & caramelized onions wrapped in crepe); and a salad - Caesar b/c of the deepfried anchovy but was disappointed to find it lacklustre and cold. This dish was our least favorite with no eggs or bacon to be found. Romaine was left whole, just chopped in half lengthwise - didn't have enough dressing coverage this way.  All we tasted were the parmigiano shavings which overwhelmed the plate.and one main - Bacon crusted ribeye on blue cheese hash browns (requested w/o blue cheese). This was our favorite.  Ribeye was crusted with a tasty green substance which must have been the bacon.  Hash browns were very crispy.  Dish had lots of flavor and texture and begged for a glass of big red wine to accompany it.The food came out fast (probably b/c we went at 9:30 and they were ready to close up). Bites were not bad and many featured cheese, esp blue.  The star was definitely the ribeye on hash - very tasty ($28 before discount so only $14 after).  We'll be back on Mondays with this good a deal.Dropped by for "Drop-In Thursdays" weekly wine tasting and to try a few menu items. Sauvignon blanc was light and sweet, with very pronounced grapefruit notes. I liked Abundance Vineyards Abundantly Rich Red (Zinfandel and Carignane varietals)- fruity, not too sweet; This bottle sells retail at $14;, Fine's at $12.66- Thursday's special was $10... I should've bought two! I didn't like the cabernet much. (Honestly, I kept tasting paint thinner... not good eats, er, drinks.) Alright, I was now ready to order some food!My companion and I decided we'd try the Sweet potato fries, Housemade duck confit bratwurst, Escargot, and Fine's wine burger (please see photos above). While I didn't think much of the fries and the accompanying sauces (balsamic is slightly tangy; tomato is salty; and vanilla bean is just... sweet) at the beginning of the meal, I grew to enjoy them at the end- it was fun to experiment with the sauces to find good combinations!  I'm sure the wine tastings and the $5 glass of Calina Reserva Carménère had something to do with this!  The bratwurst was a winner, but at $11 for such a small portion (about a 2.5" link), I'll wait till 1/2 off Mondays to enjoy this one again. (I'll have to ask the chef to swap something for the slaw, w/c had good-looking bacon or pancetta mixed in, along with allergens I don't want.)  I was hesitant to try the escargot, esp. after trying Tapino's a few days ago, but I'm glad my friend ordered it, anyway. It was perfection on a plate!  Buttery, but not greasy, and I adored the chunky bits of garlic there!  I had thought of asking for more bread, but sometimes it's better to be left wanting for more than to have too much.  Merrill, our bartender, said that many people have opined that Fine's wine burger was the best burger they've ever had. Perhaps!  It certainly vies with the goodness of Quiessence's Farm burger.  It was beautiful to look at (cooked to medium rare), and equally tasty, with the caramelized onions the scene-stealer in this dish!  My friend was tickled by the battered pickles! Indubitably, they begged to be tasted, but I stood my ground.Can't wait for Mondays to roll around... Fine's Cellar undeniably deserves an early beg-off from work!

Review Text :
Five Stars for a fast food burger chain?Spring Break, 1974...I was a senior in college and my girlfriend, Susie, had more money than good sense (as evidenced by the fact that she was my girlfriend:)The answer to her question "what do you want to do for spring break?" was "let's take your new car and drive to LA and party on your credit cards!!!:)"That's where I had my first In-n-Out Burger after seeing bumper stickers and license plate frames everywhere around LA that said "In-n-Out  urge ":) So hilarious, so "in your face"...just a little bit dirty...for 1974:)I finally asked somebody where to get such a cool and in your face bumper sticker (that'll show the man:) and I found out about In-n-Out and fell in love...no, no...not with Susie:)I got my license plate frame... properly defaced it and for I while, I was the guy showin' the man:)Fast forward to San Ramon, CA in 1999 and In-n-Out opens its first NorCal store 9 miles from my house, with 3 hour drive through waits, police traffic control, news helicopters and all the rest, as tens of thousands of people flooded into San Ramon to get their "In-N-Out  urge" fulfilled:)...Pizzeria Bianco like waits to pungle up your $5 for a burger, fries and coke...whiskey tango foxtrot! (at least you can get In-n-Out to make your burger the way you want it:)What inspires this kind of mob rush?* Is it the cool red and white packaging, with the crossed palm trees (and little inscriptions like "John 3:16" and "Proverbs 3:5 printed in certain spots on the packaging)?* Is it the special secret (or not so secret) menu?...The Beautiful Carin always gets her burger "Animal style, Protein Style" ...I get my burgers "mustard grilled with extra toast" and we always get the fries "Well Done":)* Is it the simplicity of In-n-Out...they do burgers and fries...just burgers and fries...they do them pretty much any way you can think of...but they just do burgers and fries...simple and elegant:)* Is it the quality control they exercise over their stores? They do not franchise and they do not open a store more than 1 days drive from their warehouses in LA. They make certain that the ingredients are fresh (no frozen beef) and quality standards are equally high throughout the chain.* Is it in how they treat their employees? Everything I hear is that In-n-Out is the best fast food chain to work for, consistently paying more than MickieD's, Wendy's and the rest.I think it's the combination of all those things...What I do know is that they never get my order wrong, the people at In-n-Out are always happy to see me and friendly to me and the burgers and fries are always the best of any fast food chain (OK, not the best drive through burger in town...and you know who you are Lucky Boy:) So when the "In-n-Out urge" strikes, swing through In-n-Out Burger and get yourself a 3x3, mustard grilled, extra toast, a side of fries well done, and an extra large shake...That'll satisfy at least one of your In-n-Out urges...I can't help you with the other ones:)Sweet Animal style fries, Oh how good they are when HOT and the Cheeseburgers are always great too!!! Oh so good!!! ***The service is always GREAT!!! Such nice people work here!! :)I have reviewed other In-N-Out Burger locations, so it seemed strange I didn't have a review for this location since it is the one I most frequent (at least once a week). Seems more like "creeper fishy" to me, but anyways. This location is my favorite. I have been eating here since it opened and have never once had an issue. Consistency is clearly something In-N-Out Burger focuses on. The inside is always very clean as well the restrooms. The line inside as well the drive-thru can be crazy, but it's worth it. If eating inside it is best to go in with others so you have someone to order and get drinks so the other can scout out a spot to sit. The booths are hard to come by at peak times. The parking can fill up too, but recently they have added orange cones so there isn't as much congestion between the parking area and the drive-thru. Everybody pretty much knows the secret menu at In-N-Out Burger isn't so secret anymore. I love that the menu is so simple. When you know how to make something right, you don't need a large menu. Hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, shakes and drinks are what you will find here! For me this last visit (and pretty much every visit) I had a "Grilled Cheese W/Grilled Onions" (no lettuce) and it was perfect. Sometimes I get extra tomato, extra grilled onions or even ask that they add mustard. I also ordered "Animal Style Fries" and was glad hubby helped me eat them because it was a decent size. The chilies here are good and you can get them chopped on your burger or just on the side to munch on.  If you like to spoil your pooch then order a "Flying Dutchman" for them and they will thank you :) Hours:Sunday - Thursday 10:30 am-1:00 amFriday 10:30 am - 1:30 am Saturday 10:30 am - 1:30 amin the immortal words of the Bangles:If you want to find all the cops,They're hanging out in the In-N-Out.They sing and dance (Oh-Way-Oh)They spin their clock and cruise on down the block at least I think that is how it goes now =P Seriously they had about 4-5 squad cars here when I swung through late at night with a friend to get something on the way back to SURPRISE where we were staying. It is awesome that they are always open late. Pro Tip: Do not try and rob this location. You are likely to find more cops than in a doughnut shop grubben or chillaxen here!The grub was pretty tasty. Exactly what you would expect from In-N-Out. The double double was tasty. I stole some fries from my friend since I didnt wanna eat a lot of them. Carb overload on the fries ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh... i can feel the fat growing even now from the carbs... This place is tasty and worth a stop. Its everything you could want in a quick burger and is the only "fast food" joint just about that I will eat at on rare occasion. Enjoy it, it is tasty.Gambling is my addiction.  Vegas is my addiction.  Running is my addiction.  But this place...this is my everything.  I think this is the reason I keep coming back every couple months.  Not for gambling.  Not for drinking.  Not for running.  Not to see friends.  Maybe not even to see my parents.  I think it's because of the double-double meal.  And an extra fries animal style on top of that.  And possibly my parent's fries that they don't finish (sometimes i tend to overeat =)).I've been coming to this place for years and not once has it failed.  The week before i arrive my mom always calls and asks if i want to go to In-n-Out after I land.  Though this time i waited since i was running the half marathon on sunday, i wanted to make sure when i ate there it was THAT much better.  I dig their chocolate shake too, and not the wiener's circle kind.I think proximity factors into my rating, as i seriously crave this stuff when i'm in chicago.  Sometimes i lick my in-n-out sticker hoping the burger smell/taste is still there.  Oops did i just say that?  Let's ignore the last statement.  Also, they just opened an In-n-Out about 3 minutes from my parent's house, so this relationship may have competition.  Well, there's always room for 3.See you again in two weeks!In-N-Out burger has got to be the best burger out there for the price. I could live off of the double double protien style, no onions.  Yes I am their #1 fan. I even dressed up as an In-N-Out girl for Halloween.One Halloween my girlfriends and I decided to dress up as fast food girls instead of the usual bunnies, french maids, hookers, dominatrix, pirate wench's, basically the usual excuse for them bitches to dress up as sluts. We had a Krispy Kreme girl, A Hot dog on a Stick girl and me the In-n-Out girl.  I bought my shirt from their souvenir shop next to the restaurant. I also bought my hat, my apron and my larger than life safety pin to hold it all together. The souvenir shop sells it all.We went out that night and realized that we looked quite normal. My girlfriend got out her scissors and started cutting out our shirts, cutting our shorts shorter. So basically we were Fast Food Whores. I guess Halloween is really the one day of the year it's okay to be a slut.Sorry bout the rant, I love In-N-Out. 5 stars.I went here 3 times in 13 days.  It would've been more if my family wasn't grossed out by that fact.Oh Dear In-N-Out,How I love thee! Yet, I fear our long distance relationship will not last. The distance! Me turning away from meat (as much as possible)! And you, well you'll never change (and that's a good thing.)If you were closer it may work but for now let us depart on a good note and remember the happy times. There will always be a place in my heart (and stomach) for you sweet, sweet In-N-Out.Love,NaurryP.S. Can we still be (culinary) fuck buddies for those times I come into town?This is the busiest place you have ever been to. BUT the FASTEST service you've ever seen!According to Local News Sources this location serves 6-8000 hamburgers a day!!Almost every visitor to Las Vegas must have this location on their "to do list"-I do see lots of tourists taking pictures and raving about it as they sit and devour their burgers.Being a local I eat @IN_N_OUT_Burger pretty regularly so I like to change it up and do something different every now and again.I ordered a 4x4 w/pickles & onion ONLY plus a regular with everything. 2 orders of fries.Only the 4x4 was mine but it was a real challenge to eat it all-BUT  I was determined not to wuss out in front of my son.It's only $1 to add an extra patty w/cheese so dare to be different and next time go crazy and try a 10x10 !!  ps. The COOLEST thing about this location is the GIFT SHOP outback. You can get all those cool In-N-Out souvenirs you've been checking out in the brochures.As I sat in the back of my taxi, head reeling from last night's lack of sleep and numerous free casino drinks, pocket full of cash I won at Mandalay's blackjack tables, I thought to myself "the only thing that will make this day better is In-n-Out for breakfast. Fortunately I had just leaned out the back window to order two grilled cheese animal-style sandwiches and a large coke from the drive-thru at this burger mecca. The cab driver admitted that no, this was not the first, nor would it be the last, time that he had been hired to drive someone off the strip to score some 10:30am in-n-out. I was confident that this was the right decision. Twenty minutes later, as I sat across from the check-in counters at McCarran making a mess out of myself with delicious fast-food saucy cheese sandwiches, I thanked myself for making such a glorious call. In-n-Out truly is special. It's fast food that's WAY better than any other options out there. Fast, fresh, delicious, clean, cheap, and damn good. And this one has a big flashy light-up sign.As I've sat back and watched a debate unfold before me -both online and in person-  in regards to the "Which is better?" Shake Shack vs. In-N-Out Burger fight, I was always a little miffed that I didn't really have a dog in the fight. I was also upset that I don't use the word "miffed" anywhere near as much as it deserves to be used. So imagine my surprise and happiness when I found out that In-N-Out has an outpost in Vegas.In case you can't imagine it, it was kind of anticlimactic in that I didn't jump around or throw midgets in celebration. I was just really happy while sitting in a moving car.So, which is better? Subjectively, I would still say Shake Shack. The girl, however, who does not like any hamburger ever created, ate 75% of my Animal Style burger in the time it took me to take a sip of my milkshake (Neopolitan, because you have to order off the menu anytime you're given the opportunity in life). She then spent the rest of the trip, and nearly every day up to the time I'm writing this review, complaining that she hasn't had another one, but what does she know?I teetered between giving this place 3 or 4 stars.I like that they have a very limited menu. You have 4 options: burger, fries, soda and/or shakes. That limited menu allows for food to be made fresh and people too be served quickly.  I guess that is why they named the place in and out burger.  The burgers actually have seasoning on them.  It is always refreshing to bite into a burger and have your taste buds thank you.  You can tell they are using quality meat, and not filler meats like other places.I have to admit one thing though, the burger is too small for my liking. I ordered the 2 meat, 2 cheese burger, a.k.a. the double-double, and actually had room for another burger.  Fries are average. You will not see this restaurant's fries in your grocery freezer like some other places has it for themselves!  Shakes are decent but small as well. With that limited menu, you truly know what to expect when you go there. Outside them asking you if you want onions on your burger, grilled or non grilled, there aren't too many surprises with this place.  I did not try the lemonade to see if it was special.  3.5 star experience rounded to 4 stars.While eating here, my friends claimed that this was the best In-N-Out they have ever had.  I thought it tasted almost the same as every other In-N-Out I have been to.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious and still highly recommended!  However, I have learned that everything tends to taste much better to people who have been consuming mass amounts of alcohol.For out-of -towners unfamiliar with In-N-Out, it is a must try!  There menu is simple and excellent.  There are only a few things on the menu, but it is about as good as fast food gets.  They also have a secret menu where you can customize your meal a ton of different ways, but I would suggest that first timers stick to the basics.I got the #1 combo when I visited here.  It consisted of a Double-Double ( a burger with double meat and cheese), fries, and a fountain drink.  It was not as magical as my friends made it out to be, but it really hit the spot for me and was super tasty.I am always down for some In-N-Out, and this location did not disappoint!In-n-out is all about consistently great quality burgers. One of my favorite places to get good food fast. I usually order a cheeseburger with no onions, add pickles, protein style. But sometimes I'm craving something a little more fattening (usually after a night of drinking, and I opt for the French fries animal style (no onions though) So good... so bad... but sooo good!!!This location can get pretty busy during lunch time.. But that is to be expected.They also have great fresh brewed iced tea. Staff is friendly!This is the busiest In N Out location I have ever seen. It's easy to understand why because of its proximity to the strip and easy accessibility to the freeway for tourists and locals alike. Because it's so busy, I do try to avoid this location as often as I can, but I was craving In N Out and this was the closest location, so we made the exception. Despite how busy they were, they have the whole process down pat. The line goes relatively quickly and the service is as great as any other location.This is the OG location. It's busy pretty much anytime it's open. The lines move along quicker here than you'd think because they have enough staff on hand to handle the long lines. There is also a gift shop next door  to this location so you can get your in n out merch without paying shipping fees. I hadn't been to this location in a minute because I experienced some issues with my order not being correct which is hardly the case with in n out but I have been by recently several times and it's been on point. I ask for my burger different ways depending on what sounds good each time and my order has been just the way I order it. I go inside sometimes but the drive thru works best for me because getting a place to sit inside at this location can take longer than it takes to get your food more times than not. Being near the strip and one of the first recognizable signs coming into Vegas it's a given that this place will be popping. If you like chilies then ask for chopped chilies on your burger and thank me later.In the last 3+ years, I've taken 3 trips to Cali and/or Vegas.  One thing is for certain, a trip out west is not complete without a visit to In-N-Out Burger.  On my trip earlier this month, I was fortunate to have In-N-Out Burger twice, once in Los Angeles (at a wedding!) and once at this location just off the famed Las Vegas strip.Going to In-N-Out is always an experience.  The restaurant sign is reminiscent of all the bright neon lights of the strip.  You pull into the parking lot and it's packed with cars, plus at least 5 taxi cabs too.  When you walk into the restaurant, there is a line to take your order, but it moves at a decent pace.  Above the counter is the menu.  It's pretty simple and minimalist.  The hubby and I ordered two Cheeseburgers at $2.45 each and an order of Fresh French Fries at $1.65.  Including tax our order came to $7.08.  Wow!  That's the cheapest, most affordable meal we had in our 4 days in Las Vegas.  My husband called me a cheap date!  But hey, when you have an In-N-Out craving, nothing else will suffice.There is definitely an interesting crowd inside the restaurant, so we opted to take our food to go and brought it back to our hotel room to have with a bottle of red wine, classy I know.I really wish In-N-Out Burger would expand to the East Coast, but I'm also pretty sure this will never happen as all of their food is fresh and never frozen, so it cannot travel too far from their processing centers.I highly recommend stopping here on your next trip to Vegas!This is all American food.  I'm calling it Ethnic, because American is an ethnic group too and they don't have a fast food grouping.Hey!  I'm a California girl; we love our burgers the In & Out way.  Always fresh, always made to order and always made right. Drive through or dine in.  The drive through is surprisingly fast.  The inside dining gets crowded at meal times but it usually works out that by the time your food is ready a table opens up.  On a nice day there are plenty of outside tables to take advantage of.Kid friendly dining with lots of high chairs.  They keep it pretty clean even when it's busy. Best fries on the planet because they are made ultra fresh right before your eyes.  Watch the guy take a  fresh potatoe and slice it and then fry it.  I like mine extra well done.  Not a problem at I&O.  They make it the way you want it.  Add on grilled onions with or without your slice of raw onion.  No prob.Full slices of onions (none of those dehydrated minced things that look like lice on your burger), rich ripe red tomatoes (not pink; red and ripe)and whole leaves of lettuce (none of that shredded stuff with brown edges).  The buns are baked fresh everyday too.  Fresh, fresh, fresh and juicy.On a diet?  In and Out invented the protein burger over 40 years ago.  All the other fast food places are imitators.  In California we called it a Rabbit Burger.  All your burger goodies stacked on whole lettuce leaves and lovingly wrapped.  Messy and yummy.Animal Style - it's not on the menu but you can make your burger or fries Animal Style - adds grilled onions and more condiments.On your fries it adds cheese, onions and thousand island sauce - Wow!  They (unfortunately) charge extra for it now.  Oh well, if you tell em to leave off the cheese they will not charge the extra $1.85 on to the fries though.Top off your meal with a real made from ice cream shake.  Everyone else has finally followed suit on this one too.  Used to be you could only find ice milk being used.  I & O always used ice cream and still does.Nice fat straws too - not those skinny ones that you have to suck your brains out to get a good slurp.Pick up a cool t shirt and bumper sticker while you are there and show your burger love to the world!Dang!  I've made myself hungry writting this reveiw.  Think I will head on over for some comfort food!Sunday through Thursday 10:30 a.m.-1:00 a.m.Friday and Saturday 10:30 a.m.-1:30 a.m.Things I Like That I Know I Shouldn't:Pickle juice straight from the jar."Rock Star" by Nickelback.A 4x4 with animal style fries from In-N-Out.The "secret menu" is the best practical joke since Mariah Carey's movie career. It's not secret (In-N-Out has the damn thing posted on its website) and it's not much of a menu as it is just more combinations of food and condiments (except maybe the Grilled Cheese). Yet for all my mockery, I myself am obsessed with this fast food phenomenon. Out of going to In-N-Out for two years, I haven't ordered anything off the "regular menu" in 23 months. And even then, I make one of my awestruck lackeys do it for me. It's become campus lore that if you owe Jetta a favor, expect visit In-N-Out holding a sheet of pink paper with the most nonsensical order in the history of lunch runs written on it in pink lettering.Jetta helped you get a 90 on that test? Flying Dutchman with well done fries. Jetta came in on her day off to cover your shift in the computer lab? Grilled Cheese, light fries, and a neopolitan shake. Jetta talked your boyfriend into agreeing to a threesome with your and your best friend? You better keep it coming, because all 3x3s and animal style fries in the world will not get that harrowing, harrowing memory out of my fucking head.While the life of a secret menu-aire may seem glamorous, it does have it pitfalls. Occasionally I send out for a protein burger (comes wrapped in a lettuce bun) and instead get a 2x2 with no condiments. Or I asked for "extra toast" and got a little baggie of slightly burnt buns. Oh, and who can forget the time I sent out for In N Out and got back a bag of McDonald's and a scolding on how it is very mean to write down an order with items that aren't on the menu. That's how I discovered McDonald's southwest chicken sandwich. Following the secret menu is like following UFOs or cryptozoology. It's rewarding when you find a location that provides your mysterious heart attack sandwich, but other times you (or the person you sent to get your lunch) end up looking like an idiot in front of the cashier. Still, the thrill of the plunder is worth the hassle and risk of embarrassment. Sure, that calorie bomb was never meant for human consumption, but fuck it, it was on the secret menu. It's practically a treasure. I guess that's the ultimate joy of the In N Out experience. Getting something that (at least we are lead to believe) the average casual fast foodie does not get to experience. Fuck the casual eaters. Only real drive-thru pirates deserve the good shit.After phenomenal In-N-Out experiences in Cali and subpar ones in Texas, I was initially nervous about the In-N-Out in AZ, more specifically Peoria. It is a slight notch below Cali, but certainly miles ahead of Dallas. Plus, I've learned that no matter what, animal style makes everything better. Yes, everything.A double-double with french fries drenched in the animal style goo is always my go to and if I'm feeling extra saucy, I'll throw in a shake on top of it. I got all of the above here and while the burger was up to par, the fries and the shake were definitely under par. Dry potatoes and a hard shake made for tough consumption, but 1st world problems for spending less than $6 for a fattening meal would lead me to complain less and not more.Service was pretty standard. Efficient, almost military precision in assembling my tray of heart attack worthy fast food. Impressive, considering how often they must deal with lines and rude tourists who know nothing about In-N-Out. What I still wouldn't give to have one of these in NYC ...After being in Portland for quite some time, I've been craving for the good ol' In-N-Out Burger!I convinced my grandma to make a pit-stop here for my usual:#2 with grilled onions + fries + strawberry shake = happy tummy!Service here was quite superb! Friendly, fast and no frills! This location is very close to the 215 freeway, so you can't miss it! Thanks, In-N-Out for satisfying my cravings!I usually give the nod to California for the best In-N-Out spots, but this LV version along Eastern has completely won me over. This will be the same story reiterated countless others have told over and over: Animal Style. Hungry. Win.This isn't the only In-N-Out in LV of course, just simply one of the best. Every drive-thru and dining in visit has been the same high quality, gut bombing, palate pleasing, quintessential fast food laden experience one could ever want. Double double with animal style or a 3x3 or 4x4 for the adventurous? Done and done. Skip the fries and shoot for a shake, the burgers here are the real story.And like all good things in Vegas, it's open late. 1AM on the week days and 1:30AM for the weekends. They would dominate the late night crowd (as if they weren't busy enough) if they managed to stay open past 4AM.A different location but same great service, same great food! In-N-Out is always busy.  The drive through line is long but moves quickly.  Dining inside is the same.  Long line but again, moves very quickly.   The cashiers here are so friendly.  Service has been on point at every location I've dined at.  It's great to have the consistency across the board.  Burger and fries? Cheap, quick and delicious! My fries I request well done animal style.  Cheese, onions and sauce smothering the fries - I just can't get enough! As far as fast food burgers, this is my go to place! Love it!It's In-N-Out versus the world. Which says something, when everyone is willing to hate on your product at the drop off a single animal style fry. Is the food good?, Yes. You have to try really hard to mess up a burger and fries, but, I'm not here to talk about the delicious treats served here, but the service. This is the kind of place that will literally do anything within reason to serve its customers...- You want neapolitan shake?... coming right up. - You want animal style fries on your double double and you want it protein style?... You got it. - Grilled cheese?... got it!- You want an animal style milkshake?... small or medium? You really have to fail at life if you can't properly order from this menu. Even if it's you're first time here, because the menu is so basic. Burgers, fries, and shakes. Done!  Beyond the one million food algorithms you can create here, the prices are still considerably lower than any other fast food place. I mean my order is almost always under six dollars and is sufficient enough to feed the beast. A double double, fries, and water. Yeah. I don't drink soda. Plus the food is good! Don't believe the haters. No one really hates In-N-Out, besides vegetarians, but they have veggies options available! Really, anyone who hates In-N-Out is probably just a spiteful jerk who looks for the bad in everything. I can name a few people right now... Skeletor, Thanos, Tuco from Breaking Bad, Cosmo G. Spacely from the Jetsons, and a few humans on YT. P.S. - If you go late at night. Go inside, it's faster than drive through. America!

Review Text :
When I first started working Uptown I wanted to get a "street hotdog" since I had always associated the downtown life with a great frank (don't ask me why, maybe too many movies). On my third day on the job I went to find a hotdog stand and was successful. However, it was just a plain jane hot dog with a little ketchup and mustard. Good but not really anything to look forward to again.Fast forward a few weeks. I am walking the streets of Tryon looking for something to inspire my palette because I'm in one of those rare moods where I just can't decide what I'm hankering for.I came across the Chili Man stand on Tryon between 4th and Trade and saw a few people ordering and being chatted up by the owner. Loving verbal engagement I wandered over and stood in line meanwhile listening to a random story being recounted by the Chili Man himself.There are essentially two main options on the menu: Hotdogs and Brats.Fortunately I happen to like both and ordered one of each.Then I got to pick my toppings for my meal. For my brat I just got brown mustard and Sauerkraut (major kudos for even offering a brat with kraut, which is surprisingly rare). I took my dog based on his recommendation which included spicy mustard, spicy ketchup, chili and cheese.I will say both were great but the chili just put things over the edge. It did not seem like a generic canned chili and I have been told (though not confirmed) that he makes it himself. It would not surprise me. It does not matter if you don't have cash because he is up on the digital age and can accept credit cards.So the food is fantastic but one thing that makes you want to come back and what puts this place at the top of my Uptown lunch list (besides the chili) is Vic "the Chili Man" himself. I do not think this man has ever met a stranger. He always has a great story or conversation topic that has nothing to do with the weather, sports or politics. It is refreshing to say the least. If you are ever in a downcast mood, this man can lift your spirits with a good conversation or story. He is not intentional about it, it is just who he is.Come for the dogs, hang around the cart for the conversation. Be prepared to repeat.Let's just say that Chili Man IS The Man!  The guy takes the time to make his own ketchup and spicy mustard so that should tell you something right there.  The dogs he serves are seared to perfection on his carts flat top and my goodness, he's not called Chili Man for nothing.  This is some darn good chili he puts on the dogs.  As others have noted, if he weren't Chili Man, he would be Chatty Man because the dude has never met a stranger and you are guaranteed some lively conversation as he works on your food.  An A+ street food vendor and his work is much appreciated.Hot dogs are my jam, I can eat hot dogs anytime of the day, when I'm traveling, I will buy a hot dog and take a couple of bites even if I have just eaten, just for the love of hot dogs.  When I read about The Chili Man, I couldn't believe I didn't know about him! I once was lost but now I'm found.Weekdays (except Monday) you can find The Chili Man's food cart parked in front of BofA and Chima on Tryon.  He is serving up delicious hot dogs with homemade chili, slaw, mustard and spicy ketchup.  I would recommend going with someone so you can order three or four and cut them in half, so you can try different styles!!Food cart, canned soft drinks, chips.Well, this is my 300th review and I can't think of anyone more deserving of it than the Chili Man. Sidenote: I'm writing this review while eating a salad. This is the definition of torture.I know what you're thinking, 300 reviews and she's giving 5 stars to a hot dog street vendor?! Vic is a lot more than that. He takes great pride in making quality toppings and creative menu options. On top of great food, he is a one man show. If there's a line, it is completely worth the wait. From his stories and anecdotes, to the menu descriptions and Chili Man facts, you'll have a giant smile on your face the entire time. You can't possibly have a bad day when you see Vic.On to the food, he has different specials during the week. Follow him on Facebook and Twitter to see what he's got cooking. #SeeWhatIDidThere. Vic has told me for weeks that I need to get the Life Changer. I don't want to say a hot dog changed my life, but hot damn I do believe it did. It definitely deserves that name. Cheese, chili, Chili Man's designer taco sauce, homemade spicy mustard, jalapenos and onion. HOLY. Like, holy should be in 72 pt font. I also got a dog with kraut and homemade spicy mustard. It took a lot of restraint to only eat two hot dogs.Things to know: don't see something on the named menu you like? Don't worry, you can build your own. Dogs come with unlimited toppings. Say what?! He does take a credit card. Don't work uptown and need a place to park? I like to park a couple blocks away on Poplar between 3rd and 4th streets. There are meters here and it's way cheaper than the parking decks. Don't have change? Use the park mobile app. Takes all of maybe ten seconds to park and pay. And trust me, you'll be thankful for that little walk back to your car after the dogs.Review #300 is in the books. Here's to the next 300!

I've been there only for breakfast. They serve you what they call Feta omelet: a secret mixture of, well, feta, eggs, butter and dill. Sounds ramdom, but tastes like no eggs you've ever had before.You can also choose to go with the date omelet, or the oriental one. If you order the "combo", you'll get a coffee, homemade bread and homemade jam (the waitress will overwhelm you with her rose-carrot-ginger-orange-pistachio-lime - and it goes on...-  list of possible flavors) for about 9$. A deal.Very exotic, all of it served in a beautiful place, all of wood, with windows wide open during the Summer. The only downer: the service is kinda slow... It's usually because the owner and her daughter are fighting about something, which is actually worth the wait.Plus, the neighborhood is great: young and familial, with cheese and bread shops, organic and clothes stores. Everything you think Montreal should be!Keep your eye out for all the Québec celebrities hanging out in this joint!! Not that you will necessarily recognize them if you don't live here, but anyhow, they usually wear sunglasses at night. Like our very Corey Hart.

A friend and I stopped by the ZuZu Cafe with our brood of small children after a trip to the zoo.  I was extremely impressed with both the atmosphere and the food.  There were plenty of open tables, as well as a nice outdoor area. I've heard there is a sandbox, but that was not open the day we were there. They also had a small children's space with books and  few toys. The staff was very friendly and just smiled when our kids acted...well...like kids often act.As for the food, I had "The Henry" which a hummus and vegetable pita. It was excellent!  The pita was tasty and the hummus was very flavorful. The veggies looked like they might have been picked from somebody's garden.  Seriously - super fresh!!  I ate the entire thing in about five minutes because it was so good I couldn't put it down. My friend had the hummus plate which was equally delicious, and my kids ate "the CHOCOLATE sandwich!!!" aka: a Nutella pita. They were very, very excited about this. We also got two cookies to share: a snickerdoodle and a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie. Both were fantastic. Soft and sooo good. I may or may not have kept all of the peanut butter chocolate chip one for myself.  The prices were decent - I wouldn't say "cheap" but definitely on par with what I am willing to pay to eat at a quality local eatery.  I feel like a cafe next to the zoo called "Zuzu" could very easily have been a hokey, overpriced restaurant with mediocre food, but these guys did it right.  Good service and excellent food. I can't wait to go back and try "The Spooner." ;)

Went again for lunch! Yuuummmm yummmmm Polished off a huge bowl of Curry Eggplant! Its so fucking delicious!!! Hawaiian guy and Indian girl i went with loved it as well. It IS a bit more spicy then your run of the mill average Indian joint. So be aware of that. I am sure they will be happy to tone it down for you, but then, of course, you toning down your experience. I loved it as is. Its awesome and i am sure as hell coming back!PLEASE!!! P L E A S E do not listen to retards who bash this place for various stupid non-related shit!!! Stop by and try it. I brought half a dozen people there at various times and not one walked away disappointed - From actual Indian people to Alabama hick, to Scottsdale snob to average Joe.I'm not sure when this place opened, but I cannot believe it took me this long to get here!They have a TON of vegan options and several gluten-free options which make them hella-rad in my book! This is a pay-at-the-counter-and-eat-off-of-paper-plates type of place, which is fine by me because it keeps the costs down and the portions large!I had the gobi manchurian (SO AMAZING) and the spiced rice. My dining partner had one of the platters and she was loving every bit of it.I will be back... watch out!

Empty restaurant on a Saturday night in Vegas.  Highly suspect.  Our waiter introduces himself and explains that the restaurant is tapas-style Chinese cuisine.  In order to properly feed our group of 10, we would have to order 2 of everything.  The culprits: Baby back ribs w/ honey tamarind glaze ($10).  These were ok.  Nothing special.  Spicy Thai shrimp with garlic basil lettuce wraps ($10).  A little too salty for our liking.  Calamari w/ serrano peppers ($15): this was probably one of my favorites.  Crispy with some heat to it.  Lemon chicken ($21): pass...pass...pass.  Lastly my other favorite of the evening was steak served over grilled rice (similar to grilled onigiri).  Delicious.  Overall, the food was just ok.  For the price that we paid per item, I expected better.  Service could also have been better.  Considering the restaurant was empty, you'd expect more attention from your server.

The servers walk around like lost puppies.I don't understand the need for sexually explicit names for items on the menus or the attire. The decor of this restaurant is so upscale, but the uniforms of the staff is like a beer barn or something.The sushi was okay, I've had better.We won't be back.Okay..I will try to be fair here with Sushi Loca.  Keep in mind, 3 stars doesn't mean that this place is horrible.  It just means Sushi Loca was just okay.Let's start with the restaurant and service.  This is one of the bigger sushi restaurants that you'll find out here. I dig the decor, colors, and huge sushi bar.  As for service, they strive at this as well.  I had zero issue with their service and ambiance. Good start so far. Now for what's important, the food.  I didn't try their $9.95 two-item lunch special, but this seemed to be the trend for every one else that was eating here.  By the looks of what people were eating, looks like a great deal with huge portions. I chose their fish only dishes which were their;-Yellow Tail and Salmon Sashimi:  Probably the highlight of my lunch. Fresh, not fishy, and thick slices of fishes.  Some people like their shashimi thinly cut, but it doesn't matter to me as long as it's tasty and fresh.  Sushi Loca got this right.-Spicy Tuna and Salmon Skin Hand Roll:  Compared to other sushi spots, these hand rolls are a lot bigger.  Regarding taste, I've had better.  -Taste Like My X-Girlfriend:  This is one of their Extraordinary Rolls (aka Yum Yum Rolls).  Regarding the name, which girlfriend are they talking about?  No but seriously, their Extraordinary Rolls had names like "Love My Ass", "I Did Your Girlfriend", "Taste Like My X-Girlfriend" and "Sex on the Beach".  The names are amusing, but not the type of menu that you give to your young kids to read.  I will dabble in a few Western Rolls every once in a while.  I only did it here because I was just curious.  The "Taste Like My X-Girlfriend" consist of shrimp tempura, crab, scallops, spicy tuna, and all of this was covered with their crunch sauce. I didn't think it was bad.  It just had too much going on.  If I get this next time, I will probably tell them to cut the crunch sauce and mayo. The food here isn't bad depending what you get. I'm not a fan of the rolls I got, but loved their shashimi.  But because this place lacked AYCE, I had to spend all I can spend.  Overall, nothing really special here at Sushi Loca. I spent close to $50 for the same quality that I could have gotten at Yummy, I-Naba, and Kazien at half the price.So I've been dying to try this place because they have a good looking menu and good reviews... Unfortunately I will never return! When our food came to the table the waitress had brought a sauce along with our rolls so I thought is came with it. We had been eating the sauce and the waitress comes back to the table and said "oh sorry you didn't order this, sorry" takes it off of our table and I watched her place it on another table.. Are you f*cking kidding me? So UNSANITARY!! I can only imagine what goes on behind the kitchen if they think that doing that is ok! Oh and also my "cooked" roll came out with raw scallops.. And that's not my thing!

Located inside Sun Coast.We stopped by and were looking at the menu, it was unimpressive and didn't look appetizing.The restaurant was completely empty with only the staff that worked there. We stood for awhile looking at the menu but no one came out to greet us or welcome us in.Judging by the unattentiveness and lack of patrons, I doubt we would ever eat here.

We started eating before we were at our table.  We helped ourselves to the roasted peanuts that seem to be everywhere in this restaurant.  The peanuts are roasted just right and have just enough saltiness.When we were seated we were brought some hot rolls fresh out of the oven.  They were so hot and fresh that we could barely pick them up.  They were served with room temperature butter - perfect for spreading - that had been mixed with a touch of cinnamon-sugar and I enjoyed 2 of these rolls.I next got a salad as one of my side dish choices.  I chose a Caesar salad.  They put out a rather nice Caesar salad.  I found the dressing to be flavorful but not overwhelming with fishiness as some Caesar dressing can be.I ordered a Blue Moon ale which they have on tap.  It is a nice, full bodied lager which I found quite satisfying.The main course arrived and I enjoyed my second side item, baked beans.  They were somewhat heavy on BBQ sauce but made with hearty beans and plenty of chunks of flavorful pork.Oh, they also brought out a slab of ribs, about 16 bones.  I ate one.It was tender and delicious.  I'll eat the rest of the ribs tomorrow.Went back again since the last time I was there the steak was so good. We were seated as we walked in the door, asked if we had been there before and since this was the newest of several visits, I thought I knew what I was expecting that is until we ordered drinks. We both ordered a beer and were promptly asked for our ID. Now I have no hair on my head (not by choice) and look a ton older than 21 (I'm 34). I didn't have my id with me. The waitress said let me go check with my manager. After a minute or so the manager comes over and informs us she cannot serve me alcohol because I have no id. I told her about the money she would be losing tonite since I am obviously older than 21 at which point she said "this is the sound of my heart breaking" in the most you've mistaken me for someone who cares attitude.  What the sound actually was, was the sound of money leaving her restaurant and never returning. Had she simply explained why they couldn't, no problem. No need to be condescending about it. Due to her attitude, we left and found someplace else to eat and will never be back to the Texas roadhouse.

Total east coast dive deli... and there's nothing wrong with that. CCC is a place that has what you're looking for when you need a quick lunchtime meal. Coffee, fresh cookies, daily soup specials, salads, wraps, hot 'wiches. It's all there. While the menu on the wall lists about 20 items, don't be afraid to make a custom sammie. They have a decent selection of breads, meats, cheeses and toppings for you to make a beautiful lil' hoagie for yourself. While nothing will blow you away here, it's nice to know that there's still a sandwich shop in town with a friendly owner running the place and some homemade food on the specials board.

My group came here for our pre-clubbing dinner.  We had reservations, so we were able to be seated fairly quickly.  We shared the Caesar salad and fried calamari for our starters.  I ordered the Roasted Pork Chop with Sage and Garlic and the Crispy Fried Potatoes with Truffle Oil and Parmesan Cheese for the table to share.  My friends ordered the Penne with Chicken and Baked Lasagna.  My pork chop was delicious.  It was nice and juicy, and the fontina cheese and prosciutto stuffing gave it an extra burst of flavor.  There were caramelized apples which gave it a sweet flavor and complimented the pork chop very well.  The truffle fries are a must.  They were super crispy and the Parmesan cheese and truffle oil made my mouth water.  We didn't finish all the fries, so I packed them to go and they still tasted super good later even though they got cold.The prices are reasonable considering its Vegas.  Its not the place to go if you're looking for a cheap meal, but it also won't break the bank.

Review Text :
Let's call it a very strong 4 stars plus. We came for dinner and it was all about the food at this family owned restaurant baby!Our server Harpreet (she also goes by Happy) was charming and knowledgeable. Taj Mahal offers the dinner menu dishes with a spiciness scale of 1-10. Since we were dining with the kids we went on the low end of the scale. We started with garlic naan and garlic cauliflower. Two quotes I have on the garlic naan are: ..."best garlic naan ever!" and "Uh-Maze-Ing". The garlic cauliflower was a complete surprise. We wanted to try something different and Harpreet strongly recommended this. She said if you don't like cauliflower don't worry. Even though none of us are big fans of cauliflower we decided to try it out. Wow! Wonderfully garlicky and bursting with flavor! When we go back that is a must have. For the entrees we shared navratan korma and chicken tikka masala. Both were marvelously colorful and flavor full. As I write this I am forced to cover my keyboard with a napkin so that it doesn't short out from all the drooling produced by talking about the food we had. The service was straight up 5 star. The food solid 4-5 star range. I would put the atmosphere at 3 stars but come here for the food. I have not tried the buffet but I expect it would not be to the same freshness and quality.Having been here twice - once for dinner with the family and once for "UYE - Yelp Goes Indian", I feel it's time to weigh in.  On both our visits we were treated to impeccable service and incredible food.  The owners, Hapreet and her husband, make sure that when you leave you have been well fed and well cared for.We ordered similarly both times.  We love the garlic cauliflower and garlic naan.  I got korma both times, first navratan and then lamb.  My kids love chicken tikka masala and my husband, Jim W, always wants something different.  This time we added onion bhaji, which I love, and Jim got some spicy paneer that I didn't try.Here's the dish on this place:  These are really nice folks.  The food is delicious.  The service is impeccable.  Go.It burns so good, I can't wait to return to Taj Mahal. As part of a large group attending the UYE here, I must say that Taj Mahal really blew me away. We were fortunate enough to be sitting with Ayesha and Aileen, both of whom knew what to order and how to order it sufficiently spicy. Our app was the samosa and channa chat (heat level 8). Initially, it seemed a bit too hot and we decided to order at a level 7 when we returned; however, I feel that 8 was just the right amount of spiciness to balance out the robust flavors. Next, we moved on to snacking of Aileen's keema naan, which was stuffed with minced lamb and was a good transition from the fires in our mouths. Our entree was the saffron seek kabab, served sizzling hot in an iron skillet and positively to live for. While pretty much everyone in attendance ordered their own entrees, we were able to sample a wide array of Indian delicacies. And, honestly, we tried so many wonderful dishes that I can't even begin to tell you what all I ate. But it was all excellent and delicious. We pretty much took over this restaurant. The service was excellent, given our large number and ordering at the same time. As our fragrant dishes came out in waves, it was clear the level of professionalism and perfection the staff applies. They even went above and beyond by providing complimentary desserts! I heard they were good (I don't eat sweets so I go on what I'm told about such matters). All things considered, Taj Mahal is a jewel of an establishment that is a pleasant drive from CenPho. The fact they have a good number of lamb dishes only adds to the allure of this restaurant. Thumbs way up, Taj Mahal! I cannot wait to return for some terrific Indian cuisine.Thanks to the cable guy being a guest in our home until 8 pm last night, we missed the Yelp event.  So in an attempt to undo also missing a previous event at Taj Mahal, we decided to come here.Typical strip mall restaurant with minimal decor, but it was clean and pleasant.  It surprised me to see a bar off to the side and India's version of MTV on the overhead television.  There was only one other diner in the restaurant-good for me, bad for them.  We started with the garlic cauliflower.  Loved it!  For my appetizer I went with the ever popular chicken tikka masala...chicken, onion, and bell pepper in a tomato based sauce.  You can choose heat level up to 10.  I prefer spicy, but mild dishes with just a hint of heat.  Ordering a 1 fit the bill.  The garlic naan was probably the best I have had of the 3 or 4 places I have been to.  For dessert we had gulab gamun, fried cheese balls soaked in sugar syrup.  I had never had this before, so I have no basis of comparison, but I didn't really like it.  I guess I expected it to to be cheesier and crispier and to be served hot (it was warm).  Oh well, can't win 'em all.Our service was great.  I would have been disappointed had it been anything less with no one else in the restaurant for most of the meal.  I can see Taj Mahal being a somewhat regular stop on our rotation.  They just need some more customers...well when we're not there anyway.I haven't gotten baked in many years...I can't afford the calories or the loss of cognitive function any longer...there is just no more margin for error!But there was this movie playing on the flat panel right above me...and it made me feel like I had gone down the rabbit hole one more time!The movie was about this Indian girl and her well meaning but "excitable" brothers...what a bunch of goofballs!They seemed to be stoned, too!And there was an Indian Nobleman (a Rajah?) who was sort of interested in the girl and rode a white horse through her living room!And there was lots of wrestling and tickling and witty banter between the brothers and the sister ("bunny, what do you keep in your hat?...brains?!?!")I felt like I had gone back 35 years, rolled a fattie of Oregon's Finest (and I can vouch for the fact that it was extraordinarily fine) and was sitting around watching a normal evening at the Kwik-e-Mart in Sweet Home!Just takin' it all in, man...abiding...I was mesmerized and charmed by this incomprehensible Bollywood spectacle as I had my chicken korma lunch special (the buffet is gone...lunch specials are the new reality...the "altered" reality).Tasty, tasty stuff, with garlic naan, raita and an assortment of chutney's, with the heat ramped up to "11" for me, making for a very entertaining and pleasant lunch.If they had a black light in there and maybe a little more sitar, Taj would have really blown my mind, man!Or if had just gotten toasted before lunch:-)

One of my favorite eating spots in Las Vegas.  I've been to other Filipino restaurants in LV and this one by far surpasses them all.  This cafeteria style restaurant has the largest selection of Filipino cuisine.  Think of any Filipino dish....and they will have it!  It can be pretty overwhelming at first because there are just too many dishes to choose from.  I recommend going with more than 2 people so you can share different dishes.  I usually go here during lunch and I'll be full until way after dinner.  Their two-item combos are killer with large servings...and for less than $5, you'll be more content here than eating at a more expensive restaurant on the strip.  Make sure they serve your dishes in separate bowls so you can share them around the table.  Here are just a few flavorful dishes that I've enjoyed here throughout the years:LaingChicken AdoboLechon Kuwali Kare Kare Pork AdoboChicken ApritadaPaksiw na Pata MenudoBBQ chicken Beef CalderetaSinigang na BaboyPalabokPinakbetDinuguan Halo Halo....and that's only scratching the surface.  They have more items laid out....all nice and hot.  Oh and let's not forget...they offer Nilaga soup with your dine-in order (by the cashier).  Service is good...never had a problem with that.  However, cleanliness can sometimes be questionable.  The cheap prices and wide variety of great tasting authentic Filipino food explain why I've never seen this restaurant without a line.  But don't worry, the line goes pretty quick....especially when you're having trouble deciding what two items to get.  If you're ever stuck in that rut, go ahead and get three items!  Just don't expect to eat again until the next day.-mga kababayan ko, dapat lang malaman nyo, bilib ako sa kulay ko ako ay.....pilipino-o di va? an sarap naman! tapos gusto ko yun kapeterya style na turo-turo!-may handang tumulong sa yo at kumuha ng order mo, walang mabagal na hintay-an daming pagpipilian, as in super-buti di ako nakatira sa las begas, siguro tataas cholesterol ko dito=MURA NA MASARAP PA! TSIBUGAN NA, TAGAY PA!Okay....since my last review, the prices did go up....about a dollar or so.  But still is worth every dime!  For the amount of food they gave me on my last visit, I still felt like a winner.....a full winner!  Compared to most Filipino restaurants, they still have the largest selection, and they are still generous in portions...enough to share.   I love visiting this restaurant.  It brings me back to the Philippines with their delicious authentic food and TFC on the tube!  Wowoweee!

I love Cracker Barrel.  Having first experienced it 12 yrs ago in the South, I was pleased to find one in nearby Mesa.  Some of my favorite dishes:Sunrise Sampler (Eggs, Bacon, Hash Browns, Grits, Apple, Biscuits & Gravy)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GAyHbuUTtKAdpHiFGJuezQ?select=Mjsj2CZ2GgLwp8FHZWuVqQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GAyHbuUTtKAdpHiFGJuezQ?select=DTLjwZ6D_A1_F3rHNIStiQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GAyHbuUTtKAdpHiFGJuezQ?select=k4mCERWR9ePXHvKXtkCo3gWhole Grain Pancakes w/Bacon & Eggshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GAyHbuUTtKAdpHiFGJuezQ?select=xyRLO-ivSRUBbKDSjV9KOAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GAyHbuUTtKAdpHiFGJuezQ?select=PsJOSxXEte8MYW63yhpxjwPeach Teahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GAyHbuUTtKAdpHiFGJuezQ?select=aQUTQPAKPlVpYmOajJrxnAThis location is just as good as the ones I remember in the South.

We chose the Cracker Barrel for breakfast but never got the chance to sample the food. I made a reservation for a bus load of 42 people with Michael the manager. This reservation was made 3 weeks before our trip. Reservation was confirmed 3 days before our trip, and re-confirmed the day before our visit. I called with a 30 minute heads up and was told they had no room for us and we would have to get in line with our 42 people and wait for available tables. I asked for the manager and was put on forget not once but three times.Finally I went to plan B and called Golden Coral. They were more than happy to make space for our group and even gave us our own dining area and servers. I give a big thumbs down to Cracker Barrel. This type of custoomeer service is totally unacceptable. It would have been just as easy to say they didn't want our business to begin with. They not only disapointed a customer, they disapointed 42 in one shot. Lack of customer service only ends up with lack of customers.This is about the 10th time we have been here. So I cannot believe that I have never written  a review, so time's a wasting.Every time we have ever come here it has been really good. For starters Hot Tea and Ice Tea are only $1.99. That is a good price. Every where else we have gone lately it has been $3.00 or more.The food is really good!  Every single time. We ordered dinner and it was pretty busy being Friday night.Every thing was good and came out very fast. Steak was cooked perfecty and The Rainbow Trout was really good, it even still has the skin on it. So it was really moist.Prices are super great here and service is always good. The food is a lot , and it tastes great!We really like the little store in front as well. They already had the Halloween stuff out for sale. Halloween is only 3 months away.

It had been many months since I ate a genuine Chicago Dog, and I had been craving one for a couple of days.  Finally, instead of fighting the urge any longer, I thought, "Why not?  Let's do it!"  Diane agreed, and just like that we detoured to Jones and Craig where my favorite LV Valley hot dog joint awaited.  It was all very spontaneous, and the anticipation of biting into the natural casing of an authentic Chi Town Dog was palpable.I smiled as I saw the familiar grinning hot dog reclining in a bun painted on a window next to the restaurant entrance, and felt like I was being personally greeted and welcomed back.  Inside, I contemplated if one dog was enough, and since it never was before, ordered a Kraut Dog to go with a Chicago beauty, plus an order of Natural Fries.  Diane selected a Cheese Dog and Cheese Fries.  And, we both asked for a glass of the very smooth and tasty Schrecher Draft Root Beer that is always on tap.When the food arrived quicker than I thought it would, my Chicago Dog looked like it was specially made to coincide with the Christmas season upon us.  Besides a juicy reddish all-beef Boar's Head hot dog in a natural casing that audibly snaps when bitten into, the soft and supple steamed poppy seed bun contained excellent tasting emerald-green relish, a bright red slice of fresh tomato, white diced onions, a green kosher dill pickle spear, two small yellow sport peppers, yellow mustard, and celery salt.  I did not besmirch this divine creation with ketchup, for which indiscretion Chicago natives would have undoubtedly chased me out of the windy city on a rail had I been there.  And, need I say that this hot dog tasted as good as it looked!  Well, it surely did, and was quickly dispatched.     Thank goodness I had the Kraut Dog waiting as a second course.  Spicy mustard is available but I chose mild yellow mustard, and the warm, white sauerkraut blanketing another all-beef dog had just the right amount of crunch and liquidity.  I gobbled up this more simply designed frank even faster than the Chicago cousin that preceded it.  All the while I enjoyed my generous helping of skin-on fresh Natural Fries.  They were just as good naked as doused with ketchup.  So, conflicted a bit on which way to go, at length I opted for half one way and half the other.Meanwhile Diane very much enjoyed her Cheese Dog with an all-beef dog ensconced in melted Cheddar Cheese, and Cheese Fries that were Natural Fries covered with a mild and warm Cheese Sauce.  They were very good; I know because I consumed a Cheese Sauce-laden fry myself for the sake of this review.  Ah, the sacrifices I sometimes make in the name of authentic reviewing!  The smooth draught root beer washed down everything quite well, and we left in very good spirits.Service by Michelle and the two grill cooks was friendly and efficient, and, despite fairly heavy traffic, the restaurant was clean and picked up quite well.  One moment after a diner left, I espied a white napkin that had fluttered to the floor.  When I looked again after jotting down this information, it was already gone.  The only negative item to report was so minor it is hardly worthy of mention.  The salt shaker on our table was out of salt.  I quickly snatched a filled one from an adjoining table without even having to get up from my seat, and this slight and very short inconvenience was resolved.Funny thing is though, I could go back tomorrow and repeat the process all over again.  After having had my taste buds stirred up once more, my craving for top-of-the-line hot dogs is not really diminished!Definitely five stars for great hot dogs, fries, and root beer!The Skinny: large selection of menu items, reasonable prices, phenom artisan root beer (4) service: efficient, friendly (4) value: pretty reasonable considering the quality (4).We were scouring around town to find a great place for hot dogs and so far fell short... until Great Links.The first time we ate here, we were literally overwhelmed by the selection here. I mean in addition to hot dogs, you have burgers, sammys, a selection various fried items smothered with a different toppings and salads. And for you vegetarians out there, they have a mighty fine selection of veggie kielbasa, bratwurst, italian sausage, hamburgers. I've never heard of veggie kielbasa, but I thought that was a pretty brilliant thing.Personally, being of the meat eating persuasion, I ordered myself a grilled chicken salad. Yeah boring I know. But honestly, my company was instituting this whole exercise/eat right initiative and I felt obligated to participate. (I have since fallen off the bandwagon.) Really at a place like this, I wasn't really expecting much because it is a burger/hot dog joint after all. I was surprised though. Although it's romaine, it's clearly freshly chopped (note, none of that early brownish tinge you get when it's been cut a long time ago) with other veggies.They have a very simple oil and vinegar dressing that hit the spot. Plus, the chicken was plentiful and moist. For less than $7, it's far superior to many grilled chicken salad in the same price range.The hubs couldn't help but try their artisan root beer. For us soda drinkers, it's got that real root beer-ish, herbacious flavouring (in an absolutely good way) that brought us back to the good ol' days. A must try!Not being on a company diet, the hubs has had the rueben, their KC Masterpiece Nascar special featuring Boarshead sausage, their italian sausage and side orders of their fried zucchini, regular shoestring fries and freshly cut french fries. Their reuben was pretty great while the KC Masterpiece Nascar special was a little overwhelming with all the cheese, BBQ sauce on it - it kind of detracted from the flavours of the sausage. Regardless, their plainer renditions fare better - the casings got a nice snap to it.The sides were a hit or miss. The fried zucchini's batter was a little too heavy and fell apart when you picked it up. Their fresh cut fries don't have quite the crispiness that I look for in a french fry. I prefer their shoestring fries which were much crispier and lighter -- FYI - their shoesting is more the size of your standard McDonald's french fries. Overall, given the price, I would definitely recommend this place for a good tuck in of hot dogs and root beer (4).I feel so silly to think I've already done a review for Great Links! I've been here so many times since they opened...I was going to update my review but it turns out, there was nothing to update! FAIL!They have good hotdogs here. They're fresh and you could hear the snap when you bite into one. I personally like to keep it simple and get the chili dog. Very flavorful and I don't like beans so this is perfect for me. The cheese is nice and melted. But I've also tried their Mob Boss Dog which has mozzarella sticks, peppers, onions, marinara, mushrooms and parmesan cheese.  It's a great hotdog when I'm not feeling so plain.The main reason I like this place is their Italian fries. One of my favorite fries in Vegas. Each fry is loaded with Parmesan and Italian spices. I don't like sharing mine so get your own!I remember John Curtas raving about their burgers but I still haven't deviated from their hotdogs.  One of these days, I'll give their burger a try...with a side of Italian fries of course!Yum, yum, yummy!  I'm in love with Great Links!We finally made it over to Great Links this weekend and I am kicking myself for making it out here sooner!  I have wasted many, many years of AMAZING edible delights by not coming to Great Links earlier.  At least I have seen the light and the error of my ways!We sampled the Streets of New York Dog (yum), the Ball Park Dog (classic), and a kraut dog (tasty), as well as the über-fantastic Italian tater tots.  The dogs were all amazing!  The have a great snap when you bite in to them, which is always a sign of a quality dog.  The toppings were all on point and in a decent amount for the dogs we ordered.  I think the kraut here is some of the best I have ever had.  EVER.  Now on to the the most fabulous tater tots I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  We tried the Italian tater tots on our server's recommendation.  We were going to do fries, but her told us the tater tots would stand up better to all of the sauce, so we went with it.  Oh my goodness, those things were tasty!  The garlic goodness was great and the Parmesan on top sent it over the moon.  We had them finished before I had finished my hot dog, so I used some of my bun to soak up the extra sauce and it was stay fantastic.  Yummmm!I can't wait to go back and try more dogs, sausages, burgers, and everything else they had on the huge menu.  I see this place becoming a very regular place for my family.All the hot dogs here are Boar's Head, but you can choose skinless or a turkey dog. Walking in there were several employees that greeted us. We chose a table near the window and started looking through the menu. The menu offers a variety of not just hot dogs, but also sausage, burgers, sandwiches, chicken, fish, and salad.  Given the name, I had to try a hot dog the first time! Priced at $4.59 I ordered the "Philly Griller dog" that had grilled peppers, onion and cheese sauce. Yum! I couldn't even eat the whole thing so half went to hubby who didn't care for the char taste, but I like a good charred dog. The peppers and onions had a great flavor and there was a fair amount of cheese sauce. I also had some "Italian Fries" priced at $4.29 and had my choice of shoestring or crinkle-cut. I chose the shoestring and it was tossed in a garlic butter sauce and topped with parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning. These were good! I asked for a side of ranch to dip them in and the ranch was good. Our server was nice and checked on us often. I do feel the restaurant could be cleaner inside, but there was a good vibe and I'd go back. You can place your order for pick-up as well.It's no Dog Haus*, but damn I was surprised by the dogs here! Large menu of hotdog and sausage options, along with kicked-up fries and tots, burgers, and even some chicken options. VEGAS CHILI DOG: Sage sausage white chili, pepper jack cheese, relish, tomatoes, cayenne sour cream, and spicy mustard. I don't think I've had white chili before, but I definitely dig it on hot dogs! This pick was loaded up and practically needed a fork to eat, great chili and good snap on the standard dog.MOB BOSS: Grilled onions, peppers, and mushrooms, with marinara sauce, tons of parm, and two cheese sticks. Get this with hot Italian sausage for the full effect. Again, covered in toppings and filling enough to be a meal. Great flavor in the sausage, too.Opted for standard tots as our side, and we were encouraged to try a dipping sauce- opted for the fry sauce and was not disappointed. Crisp, fresh-made tots and ample, lightly-spiced fry sauce. Good light side to balance out the heavy hotdogs.Signage indicates that they provide table service if you dine in, but we (and other visitors during our visit) used the walk-up and order method. Guys behind the counter were friendly.*Re: Dog Haus is a part butcher store, part hot dog restaurant in LA with truly gourmet concoctions. It's a few steps up from Great Links, but I can appreciate them both.I'm up in arms that it's taken me so long to try out Great Links Brewhouse & Grill. I really have no excuse. It's close to home, has great Yelp reviews, and even has veggie dogs on the menu. Come to find out not only do they have offer veggie hot dogs, they have a full blown vegetarian faux meat menu that includes veggie chili, brats, cheese steak, bacon, and chicken nuggets! Veggie items are priced the same as their meaty counterparts. I squealed in excitement and vowed to be a regular customer if the food was good. Ladies and gents, I was not disappointed. DELUXE CHILI CHEESE DOG ($5.49): Covered in vegetarian chili, cheddar cheese, and jalapeno slices (sans onions). A few slices of veggie bacon were tucked in the veggie hot dog. Tasted awesome, and I'm so glad to have an eatery that really caters to the vegetarian community. I only wish the cheese was more melt-y. 4/5LAS VEGAS CHILI DOG ($5.49): This dog comes with white chili and is an upgraded version to the traditional dog. Cayenne sour cream and pepper jack cheese were some of the unexpected ingredients. Husband liked it! 4/5ITALIAN FRIES ($4.29): Loaded with parmesan cheese. Not what I'm used to but we were happy with these fries. 4/5ZUCCHINI STYX ($4.99): These were just okay. Probably won't order them again. The zucchini was too squishy. 2/5VIBE: Small, casual hot dog joint. 4/5SERVICE: Upon walking in, we thought we were supposed to order at the counter but we were instructed to sit down at a table. Our waitress was super nice and checked in on us often. As we left the guys working behind the counter waved and bid us a friendly farewell. 4/5GOOD TO KNOW: They have a BOGO coupon in the Entertainment Book, up to $6. YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #240

I didn't think I'd go all the way to Montreal to try Afghan food, but as it turned out we finally did get full of all the rich French food we had been eating and needed something different on our last night in town. This place had caught our eye several times as we had been walking to Au Pied de Cochon. It turned out great, as it was inexpensive and friendly, and the food was good. We all got one of the table d'hôte options for about $25, including soup, appetizer, main course, dessert, and coffee/tea. I started with the Mashaba soup, which included noodles, vegetables, ground beef, yogurt, and coriander. Very delicious. For my appetizer, I got the Ashak, which was small boiled pastas stuffed with chopped leek and served with mint yogurt and ground beef tomato sauce. This was good but a bit heavy after the soup; I preferred the pumpkin borani that my brother ordered (my husband got the eggplant borani but he wolfed it all down before I got the chance to try it myself). For my main course I got the Korma Chalaw, a trio of basmati rice served with lamb chunks cooked in tomato sauce. The lamb was nice and tender, but I was so full at this point. My brother got the Vegetarian Combo of spinach, cauliflower, gumbo, turnip, and eggplants, which I wish I had ordered instead. The dessert was rose water pudding sprinkled with pistachio nuts, which was excellent. I got coffee and my brother got a tasty cardamon tea. We loved all the flavors in the food, especially the strong presence of cardamon in everything. It was a BYOY (bring your own wine) place; we were a little wined out so we didn't bring any, but there is a SAQ just on the corner where you can pick up some wine to bring to dinner here. Overall a solid restaurant, we enjoyed it.

This may be the first review that I've awoken from a deep dream of peace to write.  Ok, first I had to make a pit stop, but then it was time to pen my thoughts and aspir... ooooh hoooold on, brb...Now, where was I.  Here's a fun fact... the human body can hold up to a quarter of its own weight in disposable fluids, whose liberation can be mobilized by Arriba's own spinach enchiladas.  Ole!That's right, the green leafy vegetable made famous by a marble-mouthed sailor, now compels me to blow my own ballast tanks... again and againBut I have to say, this couldn't have come at a better time, with tomorrow being the inaugurate outing of my office's hiking group.  Magic 8 Ball says "Signs point to yes" that I'll collapse 27 minutes into the trek from dehydration, and possibly require professional extrication.You know what doesn't require professional extrication?  The cauldron of dysentery brewing in my lower GI.  Spiiiicy!But to be fair, its not all waterloo, Arriba's.  I really should thank you for lightening my load, even though I've really never felt more bloated and irritated.  *quizzical look*And if I ever nurture the desire to tarry in your cantina, which is somewhat reminiscent of The Blue Oyster on tango night, I'll be sure not to waste the opportunity, and schedule that pesky colonoscopy for the following morning.

The service was good. It was clean. And it was very, Very, VERY full of a ton of really old people.  I haven't seen this many old people in the same place at once since my last trek to Sun City.But I didn't hold the old people factor against One Eyed Dog. I like old people. I had a minor in gerontology in undergrad.  It was just a little peculiar.  On a Friday night, I felt a little like I was sitting in a nursing home cafeteria.Then I noticed that this place was supposed to be a British pub.  And their decorations seemed a bit, um, TGIBritain.  But I'm no expert on what is an authentic British look, so I didn't hold that against them either.But the food was unimpressive.  I wasn't really hungry, and I joined my guests late, so I just sampled what my husband ordered.  The wings were peculiar.  I wasn't there when he ordered, but I'm sure that he asked for the wings to be crispy.  This is the first time that I ever had wings that were too crispy.  They were dessicated.  And the sauce was adequately hot, but too vinegary, and with a peculiarly flavored vinegar.  Maybe they used malted vinegar?  I've never tasted an octogenarian, but I imagine this is what they might taste like.The few fries I tasted were like frozen french fries that I could easily make at home.  Our friend ordered the fish fry sandwich, Walleye, which he seemed pleased with.  The waitress told us that the fish fry dinner was even better with the sides.  I'll take her word for it, she was very nice and efficient.It's near our friend's place, so if he suggested it again, I wouldn't say no and I would definitely stick with the fish fry dinner.  But I won't be rushing back.

A couple of my friends and I were at Old port on Canada's day and were looking for a place to eat for dinner before the fireworks. As we were outside reading the menu, a local came up to us and told us that of all the places around here, this is the place to go, and prices are reasonable. So we went in and were pleasantly surprised :)In the garden area, is a wonderful terrace with large flower-like umbrellas, lots of beautiful flowers and brick walls. There's also a live jazz band. Lots of great choices on the menu, but I decided to go safe and choose a salad, because it was hot out and i haven't had fruits in a couple of days. I chose la salade estivale, which came to about $18 after tax. It has a variety of fruits, cubes of feta, pork filet and two sauces. I didn't like the sauces. But i must say, the pork is extremely TENDER, and packed with flavour! I was surprised it's even pork.Nachos were huge, i think they were soggy by the time you get half way. The goat cheese pastry appetizer is comfort food.If you are getting dessert, you must get the biscuit géant/the giant cookie! Served on a cast iron skillet, it's a soft dough with ice cream on top. The crunch from the pecans gives it a great contrast. It's a treat worth eating the whole thing to yourself.With the bill, comes with a rate-us-on-how-we-did card, which i appreciated. I like places who care about their service, food and how to make the customer's experience better. You know a business cares about improving when they are open to suggestions.The environment is absolutely relaxing and entertaining and I'd like to try their french onion soup next time!

Review Text :
Apparently there are a lot of people who like Big Daddy's, and I can't say that I completely blame them.  There is a lot to like.  Unfortunately, there is also plenty not to like about the place.Start with the waiting.  We all know, thanks to Tom Petty, that the waiting is the hardest part, and the best I can say about Big Daddy's is that it comes in stages.First you wait for a place to park.  There is a small lot directly behind the restaurant, but it appears to almost always be packed.  There is also another lot somewhat adjacent and across the street, but it's tough to see, especially after dark, and there are other lots up East Boulevard that explicitly say not to park there for Big Daddy's, so be careful where you decide to park.  Also keep an eye out for morons saving spaces for friends because they are going to stand in the spot and not pay attention to you as you pull in/out.  That's how adamant they are that they are going to get that spot.  Alternative, just run them over.  Maybe it will help get rid of them.Next you're going to have to wait for your table.  They do have those light up pager thingamabobs, so you don't have to wait for them to call your name (and hope that you hear it), but you'll still have to wait until yours lights up, and then make your way back to the front and everything.  I'd suggest grabbing a menu and looking it over - especially if you have kids and/or a family that can't decide easily because the menu is huge and it'll take some time.  Use it wisely.For some good news, once you sit down, the service is pretty decent for a while.  You'll see a server, and you will probably get some drinks fairly rapidly.  You may even be able to place your order (assuming you were able to decide what you wanted).  Just make sure you don't take too long, because the servers do have a tendency to disappear for long stretches.  Also make sure you don't mind loud noises of any sort, because there is a constant buzz in the place and there is also a tendency for large families to send that buzz up a few notches when kids who have been waiting push each other over the edge.Once you have managed to place your order, you get to wait again.  Not sure why, really, except that they are just slow perhaps.  But with everyone waiting, maybe it's just that the staff didn't want to feel left out, so now they get to take their turn.  Unfortunately it's the kitchen staff (as in delivering your food to the servers) or perhaps the servers (as in the food sits and waits for them to deliver to you) and in the meantime your drinks often run dry (so maybe the cooks are fine and it's just the servers).Eventually you will get your food - though you may not have any drinks to go with it - and you'll find that in a few bites your burger will be gone.  As has been mentioned elsewhere, these are some pricey meals, and though they are reasonably tasty, they are probably not worth it.  We tried a pretty good variety of meals, from the standard burger (with bacon and cheese added) to the mama ricotta (italian) burger to the western (buffalo) burger and the cantina 1511 (black bean) burger, and while good, they were gone quickly.The starches - regular fries, sweet potato fries and tater tots - were all quite good (the tater tots were actually the best and crispiest), and the sauces that came with them were good as well.  It's just too much waiting for not enough food that really wasn't that great.After hearing such amazing rants and reviews about how utterly amazing this place was, I finally took a stab at it. I don't know what it is about expectations, but when the bar is set above and beyond reach, expectations transcend into a delusional dream; a state of nirvana that's almost unreachable and rarely lived up to. For me personally, it sets off a trigger that causes me to excessively critical. I think Megan C put it best, I should have gone in with zero expectations. The burgers are eclectic and designed with ingenuity. They're made with high quality ingredients and a good list of add-ons are also offered. For a noob, deciding on the right burger was a pretty daunting task. They all sounded incredibly tasty, but I ended up opting for the bacon cheeseburger on 'Roids. Choosing a complimenting beer was just as hard, but in the end, I ended up shaking hands with Rogue's ever so familiar Dead Guy. Being it was my first visit, no subs; I wanted to try the burger exactly as they intended. This bad boy is huge. The patty was good, great quality and cooked to order (medium), but a tad too cold in the center. Bacon: good bacon, but with the sprinkling of bacon salt, the overall burger became too salty and I had to pick out some bacon bits. Layering: The order in which the ingredients are stacked makes a big difference and is of the utmost importance. The bottom ingredient is the first thing you taste, the first thing to tickle the taste buds. I prefer the cheese on bottom, and in this case, the veggies were on the bottom. Double tomato, pickles, lettuce etc. Bad idea, 'cause all it did was make the bottom bun soggy. With a massively messy burger of this magnitude, I had trouble keeping it all together. The lil' lady had the western burger and I took liberty in sampling it, of course. Actually, more like gorging. While it was also good, I can't really say it was memorable. Sweet potato fries are good, but same consensus - nothing memorable and nothing you can't get anywhere else. The chips though, I really liked. Much more crispier than other places. Overall, while my burger was good, I think the price tag it came with was more memorable than the actual burger itself. I won't write it off though, I actually do like Big Daddy's. I also appreciate and respect what they're doing. It's a pretty hip spot that I would frequent and show off to others. I think I'll just need to give them a few more attempts to satisfy my uberly critical palate before the stars start shining. Hey, we're all critics in our own rights, right? =)Burger #190: In Good CompanyThank god I was surrounded by health care professionals when I ate that burger. With a 99% chance of a heart attack, they would have had only a few minutes to prep me for an organ donation after my cardiac death. Lucky for me, that burger didn't kill me and I was able to conquer it. When out with clients, I typically try not to do anything too "Eli" like. But when the menu said "Bacon Cheese Burger on Steroids" and promised six strips of bacon with bacon salt and baconnaise, I couldn't help myself. Since I was already going to hell for ordering that meaty death on a plate, I upped the ante by adding a fried egg to the gluttonous pile. Behold;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yWUBX9Pe6pzh1PjVj04UmQ?select=g17yyWNzeNH8tx3llO2xZQIt was everything I had hoped for; meaty, rich, baconny, juicy, packed with flavor, and overly sinful. The six strips of bacon all melded together into a rich decadent topping that was only enhanced by the runny egg yolk. The mild jack cheese did its part by adding a smooth texture and another fatty element to the mix. The bun was perfect; unobtrusive and sturdy enough to withstand the burger's might. The only thing keeping the burger from perfection was that it came a tad overcooked, other than that it was great. The coup de gras (pun intended) were the tater tots. They were some of the best I've ever had. Crisp, salty, and delicious. They were just what I needed to help wash down the insanity that was my burger.Cheeseburger cheeseburger coronary coronary. I chose the Nick's Patty Melt which was a fab slab of meat on rye toast with grilled onions and a side of great shoestring fries. Not the healthiest choice (people come here for salads??) but it was massively delicious and filling.Decent beer specials and a few local choices on their menu.Parking at lunch time is a major challenge. All I can say is "Good luck."Ahhhmazing. Like seriously. Why is this place so good?We stopped in on Sunday for lunch. The parking lot was packed and we knew we'd made a good choice but no clue we'd literally just hit the jackpot on Burger Bars in Charlotte! This is my kind of place....tons of burger options with your choice of fries or tots. Oh yes, sign me up every time. We started with an order of the buffalo wings. Shut up. They came out pipping hot....literally right out the pan. We got both ranch and blue cheese (what!?) and enjoyed every bite! They aren't too spicy but have a great amount of flavor. I'd recommend them and absolutely order them again. For burgers, Derrick tried the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids and I opted for the Cantina. Soooo me being jealous that his burger came with 6 pieces of bacon (Mmmm....bacon) I added jalapeno bacon and jalapenos to mine. These really are some of the best burgers in town. It's like a flavor explosion in your mouth with each bite. Not joking...they are that good. Guys, seriously. This is how a burger should be....stacked up with toppings so big you can barely get your mouth open enough for a good bite! Yums. Add to that tots and fries and you might as well just consider the rest of your day a bust....because you will need a nice long nap!

Review Text :
30 seconds in this posh place, and I was already excited. They had a coffee bar, the most awesome assortment of bottled beverages I've seen in ANY hookah bar, and the atmosphere--oh my, is it lavish.It was a trap! $15 for a one hose hookah ties the priciest I've ever paid. Wait, what's that? It's $20 just because it's a Saturday night? Now you're pushing it. Well, at least I can split the cost with my friends. Four people to a hookah will be alright, I suppose. A cover charge, you say? Five dollars for each of my friends who didn't order a hookah? Alright, now we're up to $35 for four of us to share a one hose.But the nickel-and-diming doesn't end there. You'll also be required to purchase a drink. No hard feelings about the drink itself--the introduction to sparkling Voss ($4) was welcome. But to pay for that after the cover...isn't that a little extreme for a hookah bar?After shelling out what felt like a ripoff, I was still ready to have my mind blown by this place. Too bad I didn't even get to sit on the second floor! I asked, and received no reason why it couldn't be done when my party was the only one in the building. If you ever have the misfortune of coming here, you'll see why that's a big deal--the second floor is the coolest little balcony you'll ever see at at a hookah bar.So I finally get the hookah. It looked like an expensive piece, but I was displeased to see instant light coals (low quality) sitting on top. I huffed and I puffed, but could barely muster one iota of smoke. After sucking ash, I complained to the waitress, who was almost clueless about what to do.15 minutes later, I got my hookah back. It smoked alright...too bad they used the cheapest shisha. Why charge so much when you use such a low quality product? I can barely even call Harem a hookah bar. I think that's just a front. It's a place to sip coffee and Voss in style, that just happens to serve subpar hookahs on the side. It's the most expensive place of its kind, yet has the worst quality I have ever encountered. One star is too much, and I may never go again...unless they let me smoke on the second floor.I write this review with sadness in my heart.  I have been coming to Harem since it was Coffee Society and before they started serving Hookahs.There are no locks on the bathroom.  Embarassing when a drunk from Ra walks into the bathroom and takes a couple minutes to figure out you arent a toilet.No soap in the bathrooms.  I need to clarify this - the last 3 times I have been there, no soap in the bathrooms.The coffee is still great, the hot chocolate was awesome, the hookah was great... but Ive been coming here for over 10 years.  I can see the decline.Buy soap, put locks on the bathrooms, and bring back the good shisha you used to serve up.=(Okay so I am a total hypocrite by giving this place one star considering the fact that I have been here more than once.Anyways, FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE....Located next to RA, which is pretty busy like all day, surprisingly, this place is never busy(but I personally love empty hookah lounges). The lounge is very attractive. This place appears to be very upscale. There is a full bar and the menus light up which is pretty neat. There is also an upstairs and outside seating area.The MAJOR downfalls about this place are that there is usually just one person working. It's the same guy that's been in there everytime I went. He is very inconsistent on checking on you to see if you need more coals or not. He actually isn't even in the front half of the time. Everytime I got a hookah, it has always been harsh. EVERYTIME.Also, the prices are "go f*ck yourself" ridiculous. Extremely high for what you get. The shisha isn't a very good quality in general and to have the audacity to charge $30.00 for a single one hose, this is unacceptable under all circumstances. YA YOU'RE A NICE LOOKING LOUNGE BUT...if you give me halfass hookah, how am I supposed to enjoy myself? Why did I come here again since I had such a bad experience?...well, it's convient to me and I'm too lazy to travel.If you are a regular hookah smoker, or just in the mood to smoke, you're better off traveling the extra 10 minutes to Tempe.

Restaurant name  The Art Of Soup

Review Text :
A friend of mine tipped me off to this place and being a soup- lover, I had to try it. The selection is minimal- 3 soups per day at the moment. Today's selection was chilled zucchini, real chicken noodle, and Caribbean black bean. I opted for the black bean, and I was not disappointed. The beans were perfect- not mushy like some bean soups can be. The flavors were all very distinct but blended together perfectly. Yum. The soups come in different sizes, with an 8 oz. bowl for $5.25. (that would be the small size) Saltines, lavosh or bread (from Simply Bread) with olive oil or butter come on the side. Everything is organic, and extremely fresh. No cans here. Beverage options include a few different bottled waters, a selection of hot or iced teas, and seasonal smoothies. A BYOB liquor license is in the works. The dining area is sparse, with three tables, but it seemed like quite a bit of business was done for take-out orders. As an FYI- they take orders for soup pick-up, and will even arrange to be there if you want to come after work. Pretty cool, considering they're currently open from 10-2. I would love to see a bigger selection of soup, but the place is only a few weeks old and the owner assures me that there is much more to come. I can't wait to find out what it is.When my co-workers both had that blah feeling today, I decided we should try The Art of Soup. I had heard about from Amanda B. (thanks Amanda!) at a recent Yelp event, and had I not known where to find it, I probably wouldn't have found it!The three soups being served today were an Asian Mushroom, Chicken with Spinach, and a Persian Yogurt soup. Jacquelyn had the Mushroom. Erin had the Chicken. I was the super-star who had ALL THREE!No, I'm not a big piggy - I had a flight of soup! Instead of one 8oz cup/bowl of soup, I had three 4oz cups of soup, so I got to try each one. My favorite was the mushroom, but each was fantastic. The mushroom soup was today's vegan option, and it was incredibly flavorful without being over seasoned or salty. The mushrooms were the perfect consistency .... Yum!What I loved most about getting the flight was I tend to get bored of soup. I have a few slurps and then it just gets old. However, with the flights, right when I was feeling done with one taste, I had an entirely different taste waiting for me.  And, I honestly would have never selected the Persian Yogurt soup, but I was glad I got to try it. It was very refreshing (I saved it for last), especially on a hot day. The combination of dill and mint was fragrant and fresh, while the sweetness of the raisins complemented the bitterness of the radishes and walnuts sprinkled on top.  Janet, the owner, told me all about where the recipe for the Persian Yogurt soup came from, and she also shared with us that all of the ingredients wer purchased at the farmer's market that very morning. For dessert, we indulged in amazing chocolate chip cookies from Urban Cookies .... Yum ..... But perhaps that's another review!

Le Cartet a été un de nos premiers arrêts lors d'une visite guidée pour des invités venant de l'Autsralie. Nous y sommes allé pour le brunch et en sommes resortis rassasiés et satisfaits.J'étais avec trois gars qui ont tous pris le Brunch des cantons, Un délice pour ceux qui aiment la viande, et une occasion parfaite découvrir les cretons et fèves aux lards à des étrangers.Pour ma part, le brouillé aux asperges et cheddar servi sur une toast géante était très bien. Les fruits en accompagnement étaient aussi très bon, et non de simples garnitures pour rendre l'assiette jolie.J'y retourne c'est granati.Pendant des années, je travaillais dans le coin et, pendant des années, j'y ai mangé leurs repas et sandwichs prêts-à-manger sur l'heure du lunch. C'était aussi, d'ailleurs, mon café de facto en rentrant au travail le matin. Sans flincher, c'est probablement un des restos les plus fiables. La qualité de leurs produits est toujours des plus élevées, l'accueil en restaurant et au comptoir est toujours à la hauteur et les prix sont quand même abordables pour le Vieux-Montréal. Bonnes salades, excellents sandwichs sur pain au levain maison, délicieux plats chauds pour emporter, excellente variété de boissons et superbe sélection de sucreries et chocolats locaux.I went here for lunch the other day. I had the salmon sandwhich and my boyfriend had the ham and cheese on a baguette. One word- amazing. Fish tasted fresh and portions just right. We had the pecan whiskey pie to top things off...and wow....heaven on earth. Our waitress was friendly and I got to practice my french with her. Its been two days and I can't stop thinking about the pie!

After reading all of the great reviews of this place, I was really really hoping for a great sandwich experience.  I don't live anywhere near this place but happened to be in the neighborhood yesterday, so I decided to make a stop here.I ordered a Regular Sized (9") Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich with Provolone & Peppers.The woman working there was very nice and friendly.  The other customers in the joint appeared to be regulars because she knew them by name and already knew what a few of them wanted......very impressive.  You don't find service like that too often in Vegas.My sandwich was very fresh & hot and looked awesome.  However, in the taste department it fell flat for me.  I thought the Beef was a little bland.....it didn't have that distinctive taste that I expect from a Steak Sandwich.  I also thought it could have used more Cheese as I could barely taste the Provolone.  The Peppers were good.....although, I didn't know you had the option to order Sweet or Hot Peppers until I overheard other people asking for them.....wish I would have known, I would have ordered Hot......to be fair, it's printed on the menu on the wall.....but I overlooked it as I was trying to read everything and figure out what to order before someone else came in and cut in front of me.Overall, it was a pleasant experience and even though the Steak Sandwich didn't do it for me, I will give this place another try the next time I'm in the area so I can try the Pastrami & Swiss Burger and their Italian Sandwich.  Until then, it gets 3 Stars in my book.

After living in Northern Virginia for 8 years and having Peruvian rotisserie chicken for lunch about once every 2 weeks, I can safely say that it is one of my favorite comfort foods.  The skin is perfectly crispy, the meat moist and delicate, and the spices just enough to kick up the natural flavor of the bird.  Add in a plate full of yuca and beans, maybe a beef empanada to start, and a cold beer.  Heaven.Pio Pio nails it.  The food here is delicious, the service quick and friendly, and the location perfectly close to my house.  I can't say how excited I am to find good roasted chicken in my neighborhood.  The best part?  A quarter chicken is $3.50.  Yes, you read that right.Now, if only North Carolina would ease up on their draconian liquor laws and allow Pio Pio to serve real Peruvian and Colombian beer.Chicky chicky bok bok, chicky chicky. Oh how I love me some roasted chicken. Pio Pio is a clean restaurant with great staff and excellent portions. While rotisserie chicken is good no matter how it's prepared, there wasn't a distinct "Peruvian" flavor. Maybe I'm ignorant (don't answer that please), but  it just tasted like any other roasted chicken with herbs and spices. Good nonetheless. Sweet plaintains; well they're plantians no matter how you slice em. Fried yucca was just that, yummy in my tummy fried yucca. Rice and beans were solid but what Pio Pio does best are the dipping sauces. I don't know how to describe them but I'm guessing one is a vinegar based garlic cream sauce and the second I can't even put my finger on. To be honest, I don't really care, it was good that's all I know. It's like going to a foreign country or eating foreign food. If it looks like grasshopper, crunches like grasshopper, well it just might be grasshopper! Don't ask, don't tell, just eat it if it's yummy!yayy for AUTHENTIC Colombian and Peruvian food! They specialize in rotisserie chicken, which is what I normally get, but the other dishes I've tried were also delectable. Normally, I'm afraid to try a different dish at any restaurant because I always end up liking what other people ordered or what I ordered previously more. Luckily, this place never fails me! EVERYTHING MUST BE GOOD! Every dish is unique and original because they make all of their spices and sauces in-house, The portions are huge and I think most of their dishes come with rice and plantain. This is by far the BEST rotisserie chicken I have ever had! The plantain is also amazing. There are 2 kinds, the ripe, sweet plantain and the fried, green plantain. It depends on your preference, but both are delicious! The restaurant's interior has a very cultural, homey vibe. The walls are decorated with beautiful paintings, in combination with warm lighting. It is a family-owned restaurant and you definitely get that cozy feel. Definitely try this place out if you're in the area!DISCRIMINATION AT PIO PIO.PIO PIO WAITER BANNED ME, MY PREGNANT WIFE AND 3 KIDS FROM THE  RESTAURANT FOR ASKING THEM TO BE MORE ATTENTIVE TO US.I really like the food here but the service is the absolute worst.  The waiters definitely tend to the non-minority patrons before the minority customers and treat them better.  Guess what I am? Yep, you guessed it,  a minority. On one trip to Pio Pio, the really skinny, delicate looking guy/girl (I'm not sure) waiter with the overly plucked eyebrows forgot 2 of my kids's kids meals.  Maybe it was because we ordered so many dishes that they got confused and it just got lost in the shuffle.  Good thing we ordered so much because my kids ate plenty and their dishes were not missed but we kept looking out for their meals to arrive during the entire meal.  We figured they never placed the order but when we received the check we were billed for it.  I had them remove the charge but they had this look on their faces like we ate the meal and were trying to get a freebie (2 kid meals for $4 bucks each or so). I let it slide and left a full 20 % tip because we still had a great meal and lots of fun.On subsequent visits the service was typically and terribly slow but on my last visit I was forced to let them know how unacceptable their service towards us was.  We sat outside, which was a big mistake because since we were not in their immediate line of sight and vicinity, they seemed to have lost track of us.  They were painfully slow to take our orders, serve our drinks, bring out our food, and fill our waters.  We ordered an additional rice and beans side dish during the course of the meal and waited 30 minutes for it to arrive when we were already done with the meal.  We asked for more water and the head waiter/head bus boy/manager agreed.  15 minutes later he passed by to tend to the table next to us and I asked him for water.  He said okay.  15 more minutes he passed by again empty handed and I asked for a water refill.  He angrily said he will get to it and that they were busy.  I asked a passing waitress for the bill which she got to us about 20 minutes later.  It took another 15 minutes for them to pick up the credit card that I was going to pay the bill with.  15 minutes later when she finally brought the credit card slip back for me to sign I still had not gotten a water refill and my pregnant wife was really thirsty and irritated.  No one came to check on us and I wrote a note at the bottom of the credit card slip letting them know that we are regulars that have spent thousands of dollars at the restaurant and have been continually given poor customer service.  I let them know that this was not right and needed to change.  I did not leave a tip which they did not deserve, which is not usually smart if you are a return customer because they will undoubtedly spit in your food the next time you come.I returned 3 months later with my even-more-pregnant wife, my 3 kids and a head teacher of the local school who became a big fan after we introduced her to the food.  She has since turned 8 of her friends onto it as well.  As I walked towards the restaurant, I told my teacher friend that I had serious issues with the service at Pio Pio but the food is too damn good to deny. Little did I know I was about to be denied.When I walked through the door we were greeted by the skinny overly-plucked eyebrow person.  He walked past me and spoke to my wife with a big smile in spanish and basically told her the owner said we were banned from the restaurant for what we did the last time we were there. What? You mean tell you guys to treat us better? I asked to speak with the owner and was told he was not there.  We went back and forth for a minute or so and decided not to beg to eat there and we left.  He felt pretty good about kicking us out because he/she had a big old smile on his face. I decided we would handle the issue with the owner directly.My wife called the restaurant asking to speak with the owner, who we've actually met and spoken with on several occasions.  He's a fellow New Yorker and was super cool when we met.  The head waiter/head busboy/manager guy who wouldn't refill our waters on our last visit answered the phone and said the owner will stand by what they said.  He then said if we have so many problems with the restaurant then why do we go back.  We did not call to speak with this idiot so we did not bother to explain.  Dear Pio Pio owner- your waiters are horrible.  Today they kicked out 3 kids, a 7-month pregnant woman, a head elementary school teacher and me- all because we let them know that they need to step up their customer service.  You have lost our business and hard earned money.  You have lost our teacher friend's business.  You have lost her 8 friends' business.  All because of your waiters that don't treat minorities as equals.Salad eaters--listen up. I just devoured this salad for lunch and I have a feeling it's going to be in my regular salad rotation. A large portion of lettuce with shredded rotisserie chicken, generous amount of avocado, and the world's best salad dressing. A simple yet incredibly delicious salad. It comes with fries on the menu, but I recommend ordering plantains instead and tossing a few in! Super yum.The Pollo Loco of Charlotte? Maybe. :) BEST CHICKEN SOUP!This is our go-to healthy meal when we order lunch for everyone at the office. We always get 2 latin combos and 2 chicken soups.The chicken is rotisserie, very juicy and the salad is really fresh. Yummy Plantains, Yummy Yucca, Good rice and beans too. The chimichurri sauce will kick your butt though - dont eat that. The green sauce is also pretty hot - the white sauce is super yummy - get extra of that and use it on the salad - thats my jam!I skip the rice and the beans usually - and never feel guilty about eating the yummy chicken, salad and plantains. :)In the ongoing intergalactic battle of Peruvian rotisserie chicken , Pio Pio edges out Viva Chicken!Pull in to the parking lot as if you were going to Outback Steak House and head towards the strip mall at the back.For around $26, the Latin Combo Meal is the way to go. A full roasted chicken, yucca fries, plantains, rice and beans and a large salad with fresh avocados and flavorful dressing. Spice lovers will appreciate the "green sauce"; it's cream based, yet hotter than fire. Drench some Arepas in this sauce = so good! The Tostones are a delicious appetizer, especially when you pair it with guacamole. The chicken here is super juicy, everything is well seasoned and you will leave full!

This is one of my very favorite places in the valley. Their food is fantastic! No one in my family has had a bad meal in the place and neither have the friends I've brought.Now, I could list all the different things I've tried but that would take a while and, well, what would be the point? Between us, we've tried just about everything. The shrimp dishes are yummy because they cook the shrimp just right, it's not overdone like so many places in the desert. The chicken is delicious and the beef and pork are really good, too. Oh, and my daughter loves the tamales. My favorite thing is the chicken chimichanga. While the place isn't five stars on the atmosphere, nobody goes there for that. They go for amazing food at bargain prices. It's just a pleasure to support a local guy starting a family, eat the great food and walk out with your wallet intact.

There's not many places to go out to eat in the far northwest valley.  My wife and I have stopped in three times hoping for a mediocre meal and passable service just so we don't have to drive 25 miles to find a dinner when we don't feel like cooking.Lakeside is just plain bad.  They serve a variety of foods and are good at preparing none of them.  Sandwiches are on crunchy, burnt (stale?) bread with too little, poor quality meat.  Italian dishes have soggy pasta with flavorless sauces, I've tasted better from a jar - which is obviously where they get theirs.Each time we've been in to try out their not fresh, bland food the restaurant was about 1/3rd full and it took nearly two hours from being seated immediately to getting a check.  We ordered 1 drink each, 1 main and no appetizer or dessert ... I think they have the world's slowest microwaves because that's where the food tastes like it came from, why the wait?AVOID this place at all costs.  I've never been treated so disrespectful in my entire life. Came here last night with 3 friends after having dinner at Squid Ink since it's the only bar in the area.  Ordered a beer for myself and 2 of my friends and was promptly told that in order to get the drinks I would need to surrender my keys.  Ok... I told them and I gave them my keys even though I didn't even bring my car here.  My friends and I ordered shots, then went on the dance floor and goofed around having a good time.  When I went to order another drink I was told by the waitress that I was "too drunk."  "Excuse me?" I asked her, "I've had 2 drinks!"  When I asked for my keys back she just flatly told me, "No." I went to find a manager and a burly doorman asked me what was my "problem." I told him my problem was I was being refused service and I just wanted to get my keys and get out of this crappy bar.  He told me I would get my keys as soon as a cab got here. I told him a cab was on the way, and that never in my life had I been treated like a common criminal for doing nothing wrong!  I told him obviously you people don't want my business and I won't ever return.  That's when the doorman told me, "That's fine, fags like you aren't welcome here." That's when I completely lost my shit.  After the cab arrived I asked for my keys back. I was told, "you're just planning on taking the cab to your car." I told him my car was at home and I needed my keys to get into my house! He finally thew the keys at me and I got the heck out of there.I have no idea where the people come off treating someone like that.  I did nothing wrong and was called a hateful word and was treated like a common criminal. And my tab came to around $25 for 3 beers. Definitely avoid this place.You know, sometimes you just forget where you bought that pair of slacks that fits so good.  And sometimes you forget what an awful experience you had at a restaurant last time.That's us...so fourth time is a never, ever again.  NEVER!Friday night...fish and chips.  We love fish and chips!NEVER, ever again.Needing one last drink on a Friday night, we grabbed a table...and waited, and waited.  For fifteen minutes we were completely ignored.  We saw waitresses walk back and forth, but by that time (11:30 PM), they were more interested in hanging at tables talking with friends than picking up any new business, even though they were supposed to be open til 2 AM.  Not all was lost - I was still able to enjoy some semi decent tunes before we got the picture and left.  But not early enough to avoid the x rated entertainment.  Apparently some drunk chick mistook a table and chairs as a mattress and some pillows and thought the thing to do was dry hump and try to undress her date.  And she wasn't cute.  Ick.My family and I have been here a few times. I have never had a good experience, but for some reason we continue to spend our dinners at Lakeside. I guess you call it Applebee's syndrome; you know it is nasty but you keep coming back. After last night, however, I will never be back. We went for "Wacky Wednesday" which promoted $5 specials. The prices are $6. The portions are so pathetic that I am sure this little promo works out in the restaurant's favor. Less food for more money!We also ordered the chips and salsa which provided us with a mentally stimulating family discussion: do you taste mold or disinfectant? We never came to a conclusion because we had our waitress take it away as quickly as possible. They were unable to bring us more because the entire batch tasted like that. Homemade salsa my ass.So Lakeside, you can keep your false promotions, horrible portions, and disgusting salsa.Good thing the service isn't too horrible or you'd really be in trouble.

Review Text :
Accidentally found this place. We were totally on the way to the Thai place on the same plaza when Chez Monieux appeared. Cajun food? Hummmm... My friend said he had Thai but have not had Cajun and that sealed the deal. So, we go inside and place is totally empty. I mean no one is there. WOW What the?!? But no matter, we were quickly greeted and seated at the table of our picking. Chit-chat with the guy and turns out they are like super new. Just opened up and not many people even know about them, and today supposedly weirdly slow anyhow. Ok cool, better for us!!We order up 2 platters and it shows up real quick. They even split it for us as we asked, so we can easily try each other orders. And try we did! It was GOOD! I mean, really REALLY good stuff. And it was lots of it. Did i mention it was good? In fact, my buddy could not stop eating it even though her kept on saying -"I can not stuff anything else in!" But its simply too hard to pull yourself from it.I do not give rave reviews very often, but this is totally one of them. You should absolutely check it out, its worth it. Yes, it might be in the little plaza next to the freeway and ambiance might be all but non-existent. But who cares?!? Go for food. You will not be disappointed!PS: Went there a little while ago again with thy wife. She liked it as well. They now have full bar and about 6 beers on tap, including one from New Orleans (Raspberry one, real refreshing.)"I like""Very nice"I checked this place out based on reviews on Yelp. My husband is orginally from Louisiana so he is always looking to get some food from home. Upon entering we were greeted right away and told to sit where ever we liked. I was pleased they had Abita Purple Haze on tap. Abita is a beer brewed in Louisiana. Right away, off to a good start.We ordered the boudin balls as an app and they were very delicious. For our entrees I ordered the fried green tomato po boy and my husband ordered the crawfish etoufee. Everything was very good. I will definitely go back. The owner (at least I think he was the owner) talked with us and was a real friendly guy.I really hope this place does well. It is in kind of a bad spot. Unless you know it's there you would probably just pass it up.Thanks to Yelp, my BFF found this place by typing "vegan".  I'm so glad she did, it was VERY GOOD!While we were ordering our drinks, Turbo Dog for me and Purple Haze for my cohort, the obviously Louisiana-born chef came out and asked if we had ever been there before.  I'm glad he did, because my friend is a pretty hard-core vegan and she wanted to know all of the details.  Stinky's Vegan Gumbo is not automatically vegan.  The veggie chicken isn't but the veggie sausage is, and the side of potato salad isn't, but they can substitute black-eyed peas which are. So she ordered the Stinky Gumbo without chicken, and substituted black-eyed peas for the side, which normally costs $1 extra, but the chef said we could do it, so the waitress waived the extra fee.Whew!  It was a bit of work, but my friend was very happy to get exactly what she was expecting, and the chef was incredibly knowledgeable and courteous about her questions.  Apparently he was vegan for a bunch of years, vegetarian for a bunch more, and now just has the occasional meat to check out the quality in the restaurant. Perfect!  He even mentioned that he was trying to find a source for vegan chicken so that eventually there would be no substitutions necessary.In our group we additionally ordered the seafood gumbo, chicken and sausage gumbo, chicken fricasee and hush puppies.  I'm no expert on what is authentic Cajun cuisine, but I do know what I like, and I liked my food a lot.  Everyone else in the group was equally pleased with their dishes.My big bowl of chicken and sausage gumbo (which I've never had before) was full of chicken, andouille sausage and okra in a spicy soup base with rice.  The okra wasn't even slightly slimy, which was what I was expecting after years of hearing about this much maligned vegetable.  The black-eyed peas were equally spiced and delicious.  My husbands fricasee was a chicken and potato stew with rice and had a slower, but equally significant amount of heat.  There was a poker tournament going on, so we were really the only diners at the time.  I'm sure that accounts for the level of attention we received from the chef, but it was definitely appreciated.  He came out after we had a chance to sample our meals to make sure that we were happy, and we were.  He also let us know about other social events that he would bring to the location: a variety of bands from metal to country as well as poker tournaments and the like.The beer was awesome too.  The two brews that my cohort ordered, TurboDog and Purple Haze are both made in Louisiana.  TurboDog is frighteningly dark-looking, without the heavy dark beer taste, think Amberbock if it was actually a good beer.  The Purple Haze is a lighter beer with a slightly peculiar aftertaste, but I only had a sip so I'm not sure what a whole glass would taste like.The menu contained 3-4 other entrees that I would love to go back and try.  I can't wait to go back!

Whatever you do, don't order a dirty martini.Definitely a Lost In Translation moment at this cute little cafe. When ordering a vodka martini with extra olives, I expect a cocktail served "up" with a toothpick of extra green garnishment. Not the case. This was quite possibly the most unique martini I've ever had. Read the menu more closely and it's really a vodka-laden white sangria. And they added a layer of chopped up olive bits at the bottom, per my request. No wonder our server gave me a strange look when ordering.The first two gulps were tolerable, but as the salty met the sweet, it wasn't good. The house sangria in a pitcher is way better!

I am always skeptical about any restaurant that opens in my neighborhood. Many have been disappointing, at best. Heart and Soul Cafe restored my faith. I've only eaten there once and it was for breakfast. I was delighted to see a full two pages of interesting, creative options for breakfast. This place is run by someone who is interested in food, not just selling stuff. I had the breakfast basil sandwich. It wasn't just an egg on a crappy bagel, but an egg with crispy bacon, creamy goat cheese, fresh basil and tomato on a soft/chewy bagel. The side of potatoes was a mixture of white, sweet and blue potatoes. I'm not certain, but I think they are baked rather than fried. In any case, they were not at all greasy and were entirely delicious. Service was fine and the place is comfortable and clean. It's the kind of place I'd be willing to drive 30 minutes to visit. All the better that I can WALK there. I can't wait to go back again and again!!! Hope dinner is as good as breakfast.We have now eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Heart and Soul Cafe and can say with 100% certainty that EVERY meal rocks!For breakfast, the granola raspberry pancakes OR the Italian sausage Fritatta , both at only 8.99, will make you want to try everything on the menu.For lunch, a fresh peach salad with grilled chicken OR a chicken salad sandwich, served with homemade chocolate chip cookies fresh from the oven, really hit the spot.For dinner, the  buttermilk fried chicken is worth the trip. Served with country pork gravy, it is like no other fried chicken you have ever tasted. and that's saying a mouthful!  We came back the NEXT night and ordered the salmon with fresh mango salsa served over grilled asparagus and baby roasted sweet, blue, red and white potatoes. WOW, a burst of fresh flavor combinations in every bite.Dessert, that is another area where Chef Sheila (the owner) shines! The red velvet cake with chocolate sauce is in a class by itself. The hot nut pie with vanilla ice cream, to die for. The apple cake served with hot cider sauce, mmmmmmmmmmmm...the temptations never stop.When you combine the relaxing and fun atmosphere, the superior menu offerings, with specials that change nightly, and the value,  you will not find a better home cooked meal in the Valley.Heart & Soul says it all.  They care about every detail.

The juiciest part of the last minute get-away, I think, had to have been the burger from DJT - the restaurant located in the new Trump International Hotel.  I'm saying, on the one hand, that the mar-a-lago turkey burger, crunchy pickle and curried ("Donald Trump special seasoning") and seasoned steak fries were no joke, standout.  I wanted to write home and cry.  On the other hand, it's also an implication of a rather tame weekend.  Hey, don't call me a liar!  It can happen.

I will never understand why places like Chipotle (even Taco Bell) who have all the food precooked, and all the server has to do is scoop it into a tortilla or dish and wrap it up, can still manage to work so slowly as to get their line backed up for 15 minutes with only a few people in it (as if I'm at a Subway)!   I am not at all prejudiced against hippydreadlock folk based on appearance, but the rasta chick happened to be the problem this night, since she was moving in slow motion like she was blazed off of her gourd.I don't understand why I can get as much salsa as I want, on the side in a cup, with my burrito and there's no charge, but as soon as I order a bag of tortilla chips then i HAVE TO pay for that same cup of salsa.Still good food when it's what you're in the mood for, but this particular Chipotle loses a star for gross incompetence.

Tri Express is the size of a walk-in closet yet packs a ton of personality in both decor and personnel: master sushi chef Tri is friendly (haven't cleaned my hand since shaking his!) and his place is just as bright and welcoming.And the sushi's delicious.While this BYOB is a charming date spot, sizable parties may wish to opt for take away. Get the omakase menu to go (no joke). Everything is expertly prepared and packaged, ready to handle the trek to your flat. The sushi is marvelously fresh, the sashimi heavenly, and the flavors creative (try the rice crackers topped with seafood). Plus, there's plenty of wasabi and ginger if needed.Bring cash.

Review Text :
My husband and I ate here last night for the first time, and we will never go back.  We didn't know that it is really only a place for drinking, not eating.The chips were greasy and all broken in small pieces.  The salsa was not anything I would want to eat again.  My husband ordered the tortilla soup and he said it was ok.  I ordered the fish tacos and took one bite.  It didn't taste right.  My husband tried one bite and had to spit it in to his napkin.  They were bad.  Spoiled or something.  My side of sour cream was warmish, not cold.  My husband tried his chili cornbread and it was burned, greasy, and not cooked through in the middle.  I had ordered a side of guacamole and it was overly salty and did not taste fresh or right either.  I noticed that there was a prep area near the edge of the restaurant where waitresses cut avocados and scooped them out.  Bottles of their "salsa" were left out and not returned to the tubs of ice, where I assume they were supposed to go.  It did not look clean or well maintained.  Vile!We told the waitress that the fish tacos were bad and they did take it off our bill, but to be honest they could have taken everything off the bill.  Nothing was worth paying for!  No wait, my husband had a margarita and he said it was pretty good.  So that's it.  I guess the Salty Senorita is a loud  annoying place to have a good margarita and a decent bowl of tortilla soup.The people who patronize this establishment are the kind of people that bring their babies and/or children to the bar on Friday night. Just stop and think about that for a moment.You have a baby.................. in a bar???To add insult to injury, the Chupacabra margarita tastes like dirty, soapy ass. How dare they insult my precious X Files by naming this horrific drink after the mystical character that Fox and Dana chased after in one of my favorite episodes ever? Blasphemy. Finally, I will close this review with the tweet I sent whilst using the ladies restroom (yes, I tweet and pee at the same time):"If you are ever looking for a dirty, sloppy, drunken lay then head to the womens restroom at salty senorita peoria"Oh, PS... Thanks to Andrew K I just realized I missed the most important text of the night:"I'm too drunk to be alive. Sincerely, in hell in Peoria""Hi my name is Ashley and I'll be taking care of you. It's happy hour (pointing at the menu), the drink specials are there and the food specials there. Because it's happy hour you may not modify anything in anyway."Hi Ashley.Awkward.Arrived with my bestie for happy hour and it was early so the place was empty. I mean empty. Like Paris Hilton's head empty. Totally cool. I was already LOVING the huge patio overlooking a beautiful park/baseball field. We enjoyed HH margaritas (tasty!), taquitos (oddly only two, but, hey, it's HH) and a BUTT LOAD tray of nachos (awesome, I must say).My company was so lovely, by the time we left, I hadn't noticed the small crowd of folks who had wandered in, so I can't speak of the crowd. OK service. Great view of the park. Fabulous prices on the margs and nachos.Most of all. Great company!Well...sitting here with my man and we are NOT impressed. The decor is nice on the inside...but the service is non existent!! The beer selection is awful and their drafts aren't even working! One of the guys behind the bar seemed annoyed at us when we asked about the beer and the selection and did not even really sound enthusiastic to be working. We are sitting outside and see at least THREE servers. None have come up to its and asked us for anything. Honestly the fastest server was my boyfriend who had to go up to the bar for some ice water!!! Really?!?! C'mon. Not to mention the parking lot isn't lit up and the front doesn't have a light on the outside. It looked closed and kinda scary. I wouldn't come through that door alone. I'm only here for a friend's birthday. If it weren't for him I would never step foot in this placeOh...just to add..went to the bathroom. There is someone trying to sell knic knacks! I couldn't find the soap cause there was women's products all over the counter. And this picture on the wallThis review has been a long time coming. I go here with my girlies when we are craving a margarita and fundido. That is THE only reason why we choose this place. Other than location as it is closer to us. Their margaritas are okay, I usually get the Pom Pom. But lately it's rare when we get a good glass of it. Lately it's very syrupy or too sour. Last night was a good example of why I give this place two stars. My girls and I get there at 9:30pm, we are ignored by the waitress for fifteen minutes. She saw us first arrive and continued to serve her other tables. After fifteen minutes, my friend gets up and walks to the table behind us where the server is chatting personally with and asks if we could get service. She comes to our table and asks if we wants menus. She brings us menus. Ten minutes later, it's been 25 minutes now that we have been here. We have no drinks, just menus. She finally comes back over after we flag her down again. We ask for a manager and put in an order. It's now past 10pm and we are hungry, and there's no other place open around to go to if we leave. Manager comes over and gives us ten reasons and excuses as to why we probably weren't served within reasonable time. Finally he apologizes and says he'll take care of some things for us on our tab. Our server comes over with our drinks and finally apologizes. Okay, no problem you're forgiven. The night goes well after that... We order a second round of drinks and they're disgusting. We send them back and ask for our tab. The waitress apologizes. The manager comes over and says he took a drink off for each of us to make up for waiting.... I tell him "You mean the one drink we sent back... and didn't drink?" (We only ordered two total drinks each.) He says "damnit", walks away, and never does anything to take care of us. Every time I come here it takes so long to get service. But the fundido is delicious that we can't resist coming once every six months.... after we have forgotten how bad the service usually is.

I came to the Golden Nugget to see a show and decided to have dinner at Lillie's.  I was seated promptly in a mostly empty restaurant.  I was brought my iced tea quickly and then I ordered.For starters, I had their marinated jelly fish with sesame oil, chilis, and some thinly sliced pickled vegetables.  The sauce made with the oil and chilis gave the jelly fish a very good taste.  This was the first time I had jelly fish and I found it good.  Chewy and not too flavorful in itself.  It needs a good dressing, like pasta, to give it some flavor.For the main course, I got the curry chicken clay pot.  The dish was listed as spicy and it was.  When brought to the table, my server cautioned me not to touch the bowl as it was very hot.  When he removed the lid of the pot, the dish was bubbling from the high temperature.  I let it cool for a minute or so.  The thing that caught my eye on the menu was the chicken was in a coconut curry sauce and it had pineapple as well as mushrooms and some normal vegetables in Chinese food.  The pieces of pineapple went well with the heat of the curry.  The portion was large enough it could be split by two.  I wasn't going home after dinner or I would have taken some home in a take out container.My server suggested three items from the menu and I ended up with the lemon yuzu cake.  It was quite good and a nice finish to the meal.Service was excellent.  Iced tea was refilled often and for each course the server and the manager came by to check and make sure everything was OK.

If you're famished, this Chinatown spot will do the trick on the cheap.Get their com suon nuong (#19 on the menu), a grilled pork chop and salad on rice. Tender meat, decent sauce. Good-sized portion, too - you won't leave hungry. Their rolls appetizer is okay, but overall, you're in for a comforting Vietnamese meal.Mysteriously, the staff weren't willing to combine two tables for a large group, so that group left. The place wasn't even packed! Go figure, their loss.This place is packed during lunchtime. However, you won't wait very long, because service is extremely fast. Not the place for a long lunch. I had glazed pork with a spring roll and vermicelli. I thought it was very good. My friend liked the pho. They give you tea and they will give you more if you ask . Prices are very good. $10 or less for both of us. Nothing in the menu is above $15.

We came here on a couple times on a Friday night and had their Prime rib AYCE for $12.96 (We used the Caisno Guide BOGO)- The buffet is very simple. American, Mexican, Salad bar, pizza, soup and grill. - The best part about this buffet and the only reason why we come here is just for Friday nights for their Prime Rib.- Great prime rib. They actually re-grill a somewhat rare slab and it is amazing! Very flavorful, and not dry. I love it. - They make fresh cheeseburgers. We order the cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushrooms with freshly fried french fries. - For the price of about 6.50 per person, this buffet beats any fast food American restaurant. - Free sodas with buffet. - Always empty so service is always nice. - I don't touch much of the other stuff. It's more like AYCE prime rib and burgers haha. - Chicken soup is very salty. - Compared to Feast buffet, Feast is better. - 11.99 Fri Sat is for Blue Ace members. - Closes at 9pm Friday. They start cleaning the buffet at 9:15 and it closes at 9:30pm

The 2 previous reviews want you to believe this is the best mexican party place around.I must have missed the party because at 12 noon it was completely DEAD-no lunch crowd.And they failed to mention this is in the Commercial Center plaza. A very scary place to go let alone eat.Well the place is huge seating for 100+ people and a large stage plus private boothes.The chips are hard & flavorless and the salsa too tomatoey and no spice at all. NO BEANS either.The prices were very moderate and the portions were fair but nothing really special.I ordered the Carne Asada plate for $10-the carne asada was nice & tender but it was not charbroiled as the description on the menu claimed.The pico was weak and the jalapeno had no spice at all.MY wife had a carne asada taco which was pretty large and also a cheese enchilada which was the highlight of the entire meal.I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the place since there was NO crowd and it was also pretty lackluster food, NOT spicy at all.Thank goodness I had a restaurant.com coupon for $10 OFF.Obviously a lot of people reviewing are not open minded. The area isn't the best but you probably won't get shot here either. We went here in June for my boyfriends parents 25th anniversary. It was at night during Mariachi performances so it was EXTREMELY loud. This is OK if you enjoy that type of thing, and it is certainly a unique experience. The singer is super sweet and dedicated a song to his parents and even did a special announcement.For the food, I ordered a vegetarian burrito and nachos. Everyone else ordered various things. The food is REALLY delicious! I've been to a lot of Mexican restaurants around the country and this one is easily one of the best. The food IS authentic, I live with hispanic people and it's pretty much on par, so I don't know what some reviewers are talking about. I was impressed and I plan to go again VERY soon! Such as today. :)

First, I'll start by saying that the food, once I was served, was good. Nowhere near worth the price. Certainly not worth the wait.The only reason I came by here was that they have a sign proclaiming that they are mostly gluten-free. I walked in, the place is empty, and I waited quite a while before anyone bothered to come out and seat me, without a menu. Eventually the waitress brought me out pita bread with onions. I asked her if the pita bread was gluten-free and she told me of course it wasn't.Now, I figured this, however, if your restaurant is proud to be gluten free, and hangs a sign outside to encourage customers seeking gluten-free foods then a) you should ask first before you bring out (not counting desserts) the main item of food that ISN'T gluten-free out to your customer and b) don't be rude to your customer. Look, you just basically waved something delicious that I miss in front of me and in effect said "too bad you can't have this."Getting past that, I was finally given a menu, and PLENTY of time to decide what I wanted. I ordered the Chicken Filet Sultani, which is chicken kabob with a ground meat koobideh kabob.The koobideh was good, the chicken was kind of tough. Not dry, but maybe overdone. I then also had to wait for the waitress to come around for me to pay the bill. I just dropped cash and left.If you are craving Persian food and you are in North Scottsdale, do not go to Pars. Get back onto Frank Lloyd Wright and drive west until you get to Scottsdale Road, then go north a little way and enjoy The Persian Room.

Review Text :
The XLB isn't the best I've ever had...I still feel like Joe's Shanghai in NYC gets that nod.  But it's the closest I'll get so I'll take it.  We've ordered quite a few things off the menu and all the dishes have be delicious with my favorite being the sliced fish in hot chili sauce which was worth every penny ($14).  I've only gotten stuff for takeout but the seating area seems pretty decent and would consider eating there at some point.Christmas Day, the young man was craving some cong you bing (scallion pancakes) and I had read about China Mama on here. I was pretty certain they'd be open, but just to make sure I called beforehand. I tried starting at 10am but no answer.... closer to 11am they answered and indeed were open -- at 11am!We headed over there, got seated, looked at a menu and our server, a Shanghainese man, seemed quite pleased to speak my home dialect with me.They don't have salty soy milk and if you want sweet soy milk, you can add the sugar yourself. What they bring to you is a bowl of plain soy milk -- which was fine by us because we added some vinegar and soy to it and it sufficed. Not the best, but it worked.The XLB arrived right after the soymilk and immediately, I knew they wouldn't be very good. A few had pierced through so all the juicy liquid had oozed out. I picked up an XLB and put the thing in my mouth after dipping it into vinegar -- hmmmm --- the piece of meat was too dense -- definitely not good enough for me to come back just for these, but what followed turned out to be a really wonderful surprise.Potstickers arrived and after biting into one I was completely sold! These were some of the most perfect potstickers I've ever had -- crispy on the bottom and still succulent everywhere else. the wrapper wasn't too thick and the filling not too small -- it was pretty damn good!Sheng jian bao (don't know what they are called in English) are these little buns which contain pork. I've not had anything this perfect in the US. The bottom was crispy and the top had the perfect pillowy softness of the bao. Most places I've had these at would steam the bun first and then fry the buns when you order. This is the wrong way to cook these. The name 'sheng jian bao' literally means pan frying the bun from its raw format. What they do is, they fry the raw bun in a pan, add liquid, close the lid to 'steam' the bun as it cooks the filling and the top part of the bun, remove lid and wait until the bottom is dry, remove and serve. And how do I know that these were done the correct way? Well, there is a certain crust that forms on the bottom and around the bun and these ones had it. The other sign is that the bun part is like a pillow when you bite into them, not hard and dense like those you might find at dim sum where they steam the buns and then pan fry them.Definitely some of the best sheng jian baos ever!Cong you bing -- was okay, wasn't the best I've ever had, a little too greasy, but they used enough scallions so it was a plus.I saw another table had the beef roll and couldn't resist but order some. This was another dish which is done to perfection here! They are generous with the five spiced beef filling and the condiments like cilantro is ample but not too much or too little. The sweet sauce they drizzle into it is also not overtly sweet and so, enhances the flavors without making it sickly sweet.Definitely some really above average Chinese/Taiwanese breakfast foods I've tasted! This will stay on my list of places to return to whenever we're in town!4.5 stars!I'm half Chinese but I'm not a big fan of Chinese food.  I do, however, appreciate good xiao long bao (soup dumplings) but not a lot of places in Vegas can do it right.  China Mama's xiao long bao was perfect!  The soup inside the dumplings was hot but not enough to the point you burn your mouth.We also got pork chop rice which was really good.  It's like salt and pepper pork without the bones.  The salted pork stir fried with garlic leaves was ok - not quite the way I like my pork cooked...it was quite salty like Spam.  The pan fried pork buns tasted like the xiao long bao except it bun form.  Their jasmine tea was excellent and not watered down like in some other Chinese restaurants.The service was ok...it's a Chinese thing.  Don't expect superb service, it's not going to happen!  They did attempt to speak to us in Chinese but the only words I remember nowadays are curse words.Four-and-a-Half Shiny Stars for China Mama Restaurant!  I'm super picky about my Chinese food because many of the restaurants cater to the Western palate.  China Mama is as authentic as it gets!  The restaurant is located off the main Las Vegas strip in a small strip mall.  The restaurant offers Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese food.My table mates were very safe with their food offerings, but I threw in a couple of my favorites.  To start, we had the Mongolian Beef.  I didn't order this, but I'm glad that someone did.  The dish was created with very tender and flavorful beef sauteed with white onions, green onions, and a hint of garlic.  The flavor was outstanding, and I think this was the best Mongolian Beef that I've ever had!   Grade:  A!The second dish was the restaurant favorite, Xiao Long Bao (XLB).  The XLB came out 8 to a serving and was served piping hot.  Each dumpling has a bit of juice in it and it had very strong flavors of ginger.  Delicious and fun to eat.  Grade:  BThe third dish was basil chicken.  Served in a little pot with a gel flame to heat the dish, the chicken was cooked with a soy glaze and heavy hints of basil.  I again didn't order this, but glad that someone did.  The flavors were bold and strong.  Grade:  A-The fourth dish was stir fried green beans.  Typical string beans sauteed with green onions, garlic, and dried shrimp.  It was delicious!   They added additional flavors in this dish that made it taste more savory than the typical way it is presented in other restaurants.  Grade:  B+The fifth dish was the spicy fish hot pot.  This dish can be ordered as non-hot or as bit arsh hot that you can stand it.  We ordered the dish as spicy.  The fish was generous, delicious and hearty.  There was cabbage (napa cabbage) below the fish.  The soup was presented in a soup-oil broth complete with spicy red peppers!  One thing that I missed about this dish was that it didn't have the typical szchuan peppercorns that numb the tongue.   The dish was spicy, but it didn't have the depth that it normally has with the peppercorns.  Grade:  B+Service was great!  There was two main waitresses that worked the 20+ tables.  The younger of the two (daughter?) was very pleasant and allowed me to practice my Chop Suey Chinglish (I tried to speak Taiwanese / Mandarin / Cantonese all at once).  She understood me 100% and I had a good laugh!  The older waitress was a bit more serious!This is a great place ot take family and/or friends.  They have an extensive menu of items (7+ pages of dishes!).Food Grade:  B+/A-Service Grade:  B+/A-Worth the Money Grade:  B/B+Overall Impression:  B+/A-Items Selected:Beef RollGreen Onion PancakeSteamed Juicy Pork BunsMama's Special Pan Fried Pork BunsSteamed Red Bean BunTea Smoked DuckWalnut PrawnTechnically located on Jones, but just steps from Spring Mountain, China Mama had long been on my 'must visit' list thanks, in part, to strong reviews from several palates I trust.  Every bit an unassuming space, a veritable 'hut' in the lot adjacent Chada Thai, it was on entry that friends were located at a nearby table and with the extensive menu quickly perused under the watchful eye of a server who seemed intent on making sure there was never a moment of pause throughout our 70-minute stay an order was placed - the seven item onslaught soon to begin as the table filled quickly with far too much food for any three people to eat.Beginning with items from the oft-raved "pastry" section before progressing to selections delineated by the origin of their protein, the meal began with Mama's signature Beef Roll and with the pan-kissed noodles stuffed thick with supple beef and light scallions both flavors and textures popped, a similar compliment due to the unctuous  pancake - the poignant flavor profile bolstered by a side of thick hoisin-like sauce that paired beautifully both here and with plate of intensely smoky bone-in duck.Delving next into a steamer of XLB that was a bit light in soup despite excellent sapor from a ball of briny pork it was onward to walnut shrimp that our meal progressed and although occasionally overwhelmed by mayonnaise this version was perhaps the most impressive of the afternoon, a large portion of crisp and sweet crustaceans more than justifying the $18.95 menu price that proved on par with those at Blossom for best I've tasted in Las Vegas to date.More than sated at this point it was almost comical just how large Mama's Special Pan Fried Pork Buns turned out to be, and although some were regrettably packed up as leftovers due to a frank lack of capacity the crispy exterior yielding a pocket of seared pork amidst rich aromatics still enticed me enough to eat three, a steamer of red bean buns intended as 'dessert' picked at simultaneously with subtle sweetness proving an excellent juxtaposition to the brine of the pork while the creamy filling was forgivingly light at the end of a rather substantial meal.No different than many of the eateries surrounding Spring Mountain in terms of scene and service but excelling with regard to the food China Mama is every bit worthy the high praise it has received from persons both local and distant.  Admittedly a bit more expensive than Cathay House or Chang's but far superior to the former and without the dim-sum service issues of the later a large-group exploration of a more extensive swath of the menu seems pertinent.

Review Text :
This is my first review!! Anyway... Humble Pie. My co-worker and I went for lunch today after reading the mixed reviews on here, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I love Pizza, and if it was socially acceptable for me to eat it for every meal, I really would; I think that Humble Pie definitely meets my standards. We sat outside on the patio, which normally I would love, accept for the mister/fan system combo, which made my straight- but naturally curly hair- frizz up in seconds. I was surprised to see the place relatively empty for 12:15 during the week, but I guess it's still "new." Our server, a young guy, greeted us right away with glasses of water, and had our other drinks to the table in seconds. Note to Humble Pie: if you leave the sweetener packets on the mystified tables- the sugar clumps together and doesn't come out of the packets! We ordered the Chopped Vegetable Salad to start and it was amazing! Not heavy, a little tangy, a great mixture of veggies (Asparagus, white beans, cherry tomatoes'), and the cheese was amazing! I'm a big fan of the chopped lettuce! Next, we shared two Pizza's: Chicken Pesto with Leaks and the other was a simple Margahrita. Both, were very good! The mozzarella was fresh, the tomato sauce on the Margarita was tangy and smooth, and the Chicken on the Pesto Pizza was moist and delicious! Everything was seasoned perfectly and the crust had the perfect amount of crunch. The pizza's are small, so I walked away feeling very satisfied and definitely wanting to go back! I bet at night this place is going to be packed! Hurray for Humble Pie!!I finally made it to Humble Pie last Saturday evening... I had plans with Christina P and after reading her review, I asked if she'd be interested in returning to Humble Pie with me since she had several positive experiences there already...I arrived first, and was seated right away.  The staff was attentive and friendly - Alan was our server and took great care of us.  We started with  a glass of prosecco each and decided to share the brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and the shrimp pie.  Sounds like a ton of food, but it was perfect for the two of us.  I eat a lot - especially of veggies, and I love that HP has a large selection when it comes to veggies and salads... I have to return soon to try the butternut squash and the veggie salad (both sounded great to me).I'll preface this by saying, I like the flavor of burnt food.  So, the fact that the brussel sprouts were a tad bit overdone, was fine with me... although for other patrons, it may not be so appealing.  The cauliflower was not burnt, but it didn't have so much flavor either.  Regardless, I wanted to get my vegetables in for the day, and they seemed fresh despite the way they were cooked.  Does that make sense?As some of the yelpers before me commented, we noticed the use of lemon zest in our shrimp pie.  It was light on the shrimp, sauce, and cheese, but it did have a zesty flavor to it.  I added some chili pepper flakes and parmesan as well... mmmm.As if I hadn't eaten enough food, Christina requested a small sample of the olive oil gelato so I could taste it... and I actually enjoyed it!  If you're open to trying something new, the olive oil gelato is the perfect sweet ending to your meal at Humble Pie.My 4 star rating is for my overall experience at Humble Pie - I was in fantastic company, a casual environment (which I love), and lots of veggie options to choose from... the pizza was fine - I'll try another selection next visit.I also noticed that there is plenty of bar seating for those that like to sit at the bar, hang with the bartender, etc... good to know in case I ever return solo!  Either way, I'm sure I'll be back soon.This place rocks my socks off.My co-workers at my new job brought me here as a welcome to the company gesture and I'm not lying when I say that I ate the best wood-fired pizza 'ive ever had in my entire life today. Not only did I try the Margherita, but then we decided it was necessary to order 2 more, pepperoni and some other mushroom thing. All of them were equally delicious, perfect crust and just the right amount of cheese and toppings. The Caesar salad, also awesome.. and how could we forget the full bar?! The outdoor patio is absolutely divine  this time of year and the servers there are not only very friendly, but will yell at the bartender when he pours you a weak drink. I dont remember your name dude, but thank you for being the most wonderful person of the day.I dont normally rave about pizza, and I usually only eat it when im hammered, but Humble Pie has won my heart, and I forsee many many more lunch breaks being taken here.. hammered or not.Humble Pie gets no respect.There are quite a few 'marquee' pizza places in the valley...some that come to mind would be Pizzeria Bianco, Cibo, The Parlor, Pomo, and Patsy Grimaldis. Ask a random person on Yelp what their favorite pizza place is, and chances are you're gonna hear one of those names mentioned. (This includes us by the way). I've never heard anyone say that Humble Pie is their favorite or even in their top three. I wonder why? I could be crazy...but if I was to take a Humble Pie pizza and put it in a taste test with the aforementioned places...I don't think the majority of people would notice a big difference in the level of 'goodness'. Each place has unique flavors, but they're all really damn tasty. Unless you're familiar which how each pie tastes from experience, I think you'd be stumped to identify which came from where. What I'm trying to say is Humble Pie can hang with the big boys. So...I'm sitting here wondering now...why don't more people rave about this place...why don't I myself rave about this place?! Could it be something so simple as atmosphere? Humble Pie's interior is very...should I say...humble. There's nothing snazzy or memorable about this place, other than the actual food which is quite good. Cibo is in a quaint old house, Pizzeria Bianco is overflowing with prestige and this aura of greatness from all the national attention...Humble Pie is basically just a storefront with an interior that could have very well been put together by someone who just read 'Interior Design for Dummies'...it doesn't take much chances, and it shows. So...what does that leave us with here? A pizza place with awesome food, but not much else. I definitely recommend it, but I expect it to continue to hover right below the other more well known places for the foreseeable future. 3.5/5  (Rounded up to 4 since we ate here on one of our first date nights, and I have fond memories of it.)Humble Pie really shouldn't be Humble any more...this place is awesome now!  House made Burrata...house made mozzerella...fabulous meatballs, tasty sauce on the pizzas, wild mushroom mix...the pizza, caprese are both amazing...great service and speedy for take out.We tried the wings and they are so so...but everything else was extraordinary.  Don't hesitate this place has been remarkable the 3 times I have visited recently!Yum.  I could end my review there, but my mystery "fans" might be disappointed.We had a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was almost empty.  I'm glad about that because I didn't care for the layout of the dining room.  Unless the room had been set up for a large group that had left, with the exception of counter seating and a few four-top pub tables, all the seating was 2 long rows of small tables placed about 6 inches from each other.  Although it does make it easy to set up tables for groups of any size, I'm not fond of sitting on a stranger's lap generally.  We started with a small caprese plate with house-made burrata, pesto, cherry tomatoes, balsamic, and ciabatta toasts.  We were starving, so we devoured it pretty quickly, leading the server to comment "you finished that already?"  Yes, we did, it was a small, and it was delicious.  But I appreciated her not outright saying, "wow, nice job fat-ass."Next up was the potato and roasted garlic pizza with fontina, gorgonzola, leeks, rosemary, and the addition of prosciutto.  My husband insisted I choose the pizza, and I loved every bite of it!  And the best part was I loved every bite of it because he didn't.  So I generously suggested he order another pizza knowing I would have it all to myself.  He went with the pepperoni.  Although they are very generous with the pepperoni, it's still just a pepperoni pizza.  The sauce was a little sweet for me, but I prefer a spicier sauce.  Can't wait to come back and try the pistachio pizza.  And for the record, no soggy crust!Suffice it to say...Yum.My son wanted to treat his boyfriend and me to dinner, wanted something near the theater we were headed too and something they haven't tried.  I saw Humble Pie was in the area and asked if they were game and yes they were. Now I have heard good sold things about Humble Pie from many friends so I was pretty excited to try them out.  It was Sunday night around 5:30, we walked in and where greeted right away and asked how many in the party, then the host turned his back , a server walked up and asked how many in the party, I had to answer because it appeared the host had better things to do, why even ask if you didn't even care.We were seated handed menus and drink orders were taken.  For appetizers I ordered the toasted ravioli,  they were stuffed with ricotta cheese and served with marinara sauce. To be honest this dish lacked flavor, Prego sauce has more flavor that the marinara sauce that came with it.  1/2 the raviolis were toasted perfectly, the other were just hard. Even though the dish looked great the dish didn't wow me. My son ordered the lasagna, which was the winning dish of the night, everything cooked perfectly!  His date ordered the Penne with Vodka Sauce with chicken (5 buck upcharge, when it came out it looked like adding the chicken to the dish was an afterthought, it was just a chicken breast diced up lying on top of the pasta. The sauce had great color but lacked flavor. Since I was at Humble Pie, pie is what I am getting right?  Wood oven cooked pizza sounded amazing!  I ordered the bbq chicken pizza with smoked mozzarella, bacon, fontina, green onions and bbq sauce, the bbq chicken is one of my favorite types of pizza, so I was pretty excited. When I got my pizza it looked pretty amazing, but when I started to eat it, I noticed it was covered with grease, even my crust was soaked in grease, I couldn't eat it all, my belly was becoming a grease pit, it was just too much for me.  Our server was never around (it wasn't that busy) the food was ok, the place looks like a lot of fun, the lasagna rocked, but my return rate very low.

Restaurant name  La Piccola Cucina

Review Text :
I just wasn't impressed with this place. My lack of enthusiasm has little to do with being narrow-minded about food or being unable to appreciate small/local businesses. I point this out because it seems like a lot of other reviewers think that anyone who doesn't like this place (or the owner) is an unsophisticated country bumpkin or a chain restaurant freak. Well, I like to think I have a pretty open mind when it comes to food and the ability to differentiate between food that is well prepared and food that falls a little short. On top of that, I love supporting local businesses that bring something new to the table. Given all this, I really wanted to  like La Piccola Cucina, but was surprised (and a bit disappointed) when it didn't turn out to be everything I had hoped for. I tried this place a few weeks ago with the lovely Kristin S as my lunch date. The historic house was certainly adorable and the patio a wonderful spot to eat al fresco. Also,  the young man who took our orders was really polite and helpful, but the food was just not very good. I'm a big fan of the "tavola calda" (hot food served buffet style with a focus on protein and sides) model and ate at many such places in Italy, but the "hot table" at La Piccola Cucina was not so "hot." My rotisserie style chicken was incredibly dry. The skin was also overcooked and a bit flavorless.  I also tried a piece of Kristin's chicken breast and found it to be dry. The eggplant side was flavorful but so oily I felt a little queasy after eating it. The roasted zucchini side was cooked to the right texture but had a strange, almost sour, flavor to it. At a certain point in our meal, the owner came by the table and asked how we were doing. He noticed I hadn't eaten much of the chicken and asked if everything was ok. I said that I wanted to be honest and that I had found my chicken to be dry. He apologized in a way that wasn't all that apologetic and asked me if I wanted another piece of the same chicken. Confused by the offer, I declined and just said we'd come close out our tab. He didn't say anything else. I was definitely disappointed in the food, but I was even more disappointed that the owner didn't truly seem concerned that I had had a sub-par meal. If your food is incredible, then feel free to cop the "only an imbecile could dislike this" attitude. Otherwise, remain open to feedback and constantly strive to deliver a consistently good product. In my humble opinion, that's what makes for a good local restaurant that sticks around in the hard times. I'd be open to coming back here and trying a sandwich at some point, but jumping out my seat to go back here, I am not.It's located in an old house on 7th St. in the Coronado area.  Patio is awesome and has a slight European/Spanish feel to it.  The food in the deli looked appetizing and gourmet.  I ordered the prosciutto sandwich and my wife had the sirloin.   The bread was quite good and appeared to be made on location.  The prosciutto was decent.However the sirloin came out bloody at first which the owner admitted before even placing on our table.  It is supposed to be medium, per his admission, so we were confused why he even brought it out.  When my wife asked him about this he leered at her and said he knew what "medium meant", and then took it back to the kitchen.  Before this he talked to her rudely when she was looking for the restroom.  The restrooms are labeled in Italian which my wife speaks, along with French, Spanish, and English.  She paused in front of the door to adjust her purse and the aforementioned owner told her "that's right, it means ladies room in Italian", in a tone you would take with a child.  After the sirloin issue, my wife and I just stared at each other in disbelief at the audacity of this fat, bad mannered, self righteous man.When the sirloin came back out it was cooked properly but lacked flavor.  The bread was the only thing worth eating on the plate.The server who took our order was this prissy guy who lacked not only personality but any sense of being helpful.  I don't know if the owner is trying to create this New York/European "poor service because we can" atmosphere but, please, that doesn't fly here and anyone that thinks this is acceptable must have very low self esteem.  You can't talk to customers like that, I don't care how good your food may be, and in this case it was mediocre.And to clarify, I hate chain restaurants, always try to support local business, and know good food and service when I experience it.  So it's not that I "don't get it".  I will never return to this restaurant and implore you not to go here either.  Oh, and if you are the owner, rest assured I will be scathing your restaurant on other review websites along with telling every single person I know how rude you are and how mediocre your cooking is.  I promise you will make less money because of your behavior towards my wife.I had the prosciutto sandwich, and it was delicious. That's all I'm going to say about the food. Dude, the service...it sucked. I am low maintenance, and am equipped with low expecations to match, and it still sucked. All I need is a smile and maybe, I don't know, a polite greeting of some kind, and I am satisfied in the service department. Totally didn't happen here. The restaurant, per its website and posted hours, opens at 10:00 AM. I can't imagine anyone actually goes there that early, but, okay. It's when they open. Now, as anyone who has worked downtown for more than a week knows, if you want to go somewhere and get in and out and back to your desk in a manageable amount of time, you need to adjust your lunch time aim - shoot for 11:30, or shoot for 1:30. Anything in between will only bring you lines, misery, and a bitch of a time parking...especially on 7th Street. So, I mosied on over to La Piccola Cucina at exactly 11:20...an hour and twenty minutes after they opened, mind. I walked in, and was greeted by a scowling, irritated-looking girl at front counter in a hot pink sweatshirt and super tight black pants, (the owner's daughter, I was able to ascertain from newspaper clippings posted on the restaurant walls). She looked at me and said, in a very put-upon tone...are you ready for this..."Yeah? What do you need?""Yeah? What do you need?" You're working at a restaurant...it's 11:30 at this point...I've approached the counter to order...and you're copping an attitude like you can't possibly imagine what I would be doing there? Right. Keep on keepin' on, girl. DIVA FOR LIFE!I said, "Um...I'd like to order something to go..." No menus are to be seen...I later discovered that the sandwich menu is posted on the wall somewhere, but this wasn't pointed out to me. Good thing I read some Yelp reviews before I went, so I had some idea of what was available...oh, PS - the gelato cases and the food cases were empty. Totally empty. Avoiding eye contact with me, she fumbled with a bunch of papers by the register, still looking completely annoyed by my existence,."Uh, we're not even really OPEN yet." I look behind me at the clock on the wall, and the front door that is propped open all the way. I had no idea how to respond to that, so I didn't. Just awkwardly stood there till she took my order. I ordered the prosciutto sandwich, no wilted greens. Of course, it came with wilted greens, which would be forgivable if I hadn't been treated like a leper. While I was waiting, another couple came in and was helped by the owner's wife...food/gelato cases were still empty, and she wasn't super friendly, but she at least acknowledged them as human beings and pointed out where the menus were.The owner, so often immortalized in Yelp reviews as a loud, friendly, brusque gentleman, just kind of lumbered around the restaurant, frowning, without a smile or word for anyone.My sandwich was awesome, but there are too many other mom-n'-pops downtown to even bother giving business to a place where the staff cops an attitude. Really and truly. Sucks for them, because I'm the kind of person who goes back to a place over and over again, and tries everything. I tell my friends and family, I write nice reviews on Yelp. In this case, several co-workers wanted to know where I got my sandwich from, and I lied. Sorry, guys. Attitude matters.I absolutely never give a bad review. The only time I give a review is if I like it. But I had to for this one because of the owner Andy who was a pompous jerk. We tried to be friendly and he was arrogant about his cooking skills. He went on that he used to have a cooking show etc. When asked if he did the cooking he went on about he teaches the people that work for him to cook. It was like it was beneath him to cook. No wonder his little show never made it big.  I give this place 1 star because of the ambiance and because of the fabulous gelato and fabulous cappuccino and the owners wonderful daughter. We went there because of the groupon coupon we bought. They were overwhelmed to the point of being rude. Especially the owner, Andy. It seemed like they needed to staff accordingly. They were upset because people did not make reservations and just showed up. While we were there , quite a few people walked out. Its not that they were packed either. 1st of all, we tried calling several times and the phone was busy continuously. You'd think at this day and age they would have voice mail or something. 2nd you make reservations for places that are a full service restaurant not a cafeteria style service. This is a place that you look into the cooler and decide what you want that is already cooked. The food was terrible. Now if you do not cook, it may be good for you. Both my husband and I are very creative cooks. The lamb was the worst I have ever had. Dry and absolutely no flavor. Yes and I know my lamb. My husband had the dry turkey. Our son had the dry meat loaf. I think all of them were dry because they were re-heated in a microwave. We do not do that even at home. The side dishes were still bearable.    I would have gone back there for the gelato and cappuccino if we did not have other place I can get the 2.My sister and I found this restaurant through Groupon. Our first impression was good... Adorable ambiance, delicious looking case of gelato, large inviting patio.  We were greeted by a sloppy surly man, who we later found out is the owner Andy. We were seated on the patio along with the only other customer.  We started off by ordering a bottle of sparking water. "You guys don't want any wine?!" said Andy abruptly. Uh no thanks.  Next we ordered dinner.  My sister is vegetarian, so we were ordering meatless options this evening.  We ordered a selection of bland, boring, typical food. For some reason Andy seemed confused that we wanted to share a few items.  The food came... Andy dropped it and ran off.  We were sharing so we wanted plates. We waited for a long time. No Andy.  I went into the restaurant to ask for plates and some salt&pepper. Andy seemed confused. "why do you need plates? I don't get it. You eatin it like Chinese food or something?!?" He brought the plates and the salt & pepper and said "You know you really shouldn't put anything on it until you taste it." Thanks for the words of wisdom.  We ate our depressing display of  cuisine in hopes that dessert would help this disaster. We waited, and waited, and waited, and waited some more( Andy was busy sitting at the other customer's table talking all night).  By the time he finally got around to clear our plates we were so ready to get the heck outta there we decided to skip dessert. NEXT CAME THE ICING ON THE POORLY MADE CAKE:I decided to tell Andy how I felt about the poor service.  As a person in the customer service industry, I know I would appreciate the polite constructive criticism.  He was apparently OUTRAGED by the comments. He proceeded to argue with us about every comment we had.  He even went so far as to walk into the restaurant to yell to his co-workers about my apparently salacious comments.  He told me the balance of our Groupon tab was on him. I left cash on the table for it anyway.  He then chased us into the parking lot to try and give the money back.  When I refused he yelled "I don't want this I will donate it to charity!!!" WHAT!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?Yikes, reading other reviews I realize my bad experience wasn't unique. As a server I make a very laid back customer. I like pretty much everything I eat and don't require a lot of attention from the waiter. La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house. Our guy, though adorable and friendly, was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken. Like other reviewers mentioned, he was frantic and made that clear to every customer. At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person! I left super stressed out from the experience, which is very, very unusual for me. You can either have bad service or bad food, but not both.This is one of those reviews that I wish I could give a half star to and make it 3.5. I've been teetering on 3 and 4, but I'm going to round up and give it four because I liked everything about this place, I just didn't love everything about it. I like that this is a homey little shop situated in a converted house. I like how they offer counter ordering as well as sit-down dining. I also like how they have an extensive ice cream selection staring at me when I walk inside. The food is decent. The bread is soft, the salad was ok. I got half and half...half Greek salad and a half of the prosciutto mozzarella sandwich based on the raving Yelp reviews.  The Greek salad was pretty tasty but they went really heavy on the dressing. Next time I will ask for it on the side. I liked the bread, vinegar, mozzarella and peppers in the Prosciutto sandwich. I wasn't a huge fan of the Prosciutto though. I found chunks in my Prosciutto and I just wasn't prepared for chunky meat, more the thinly sliced Prosciutto. The sandwich was ok though and I finished it, but I'll probably order something different next time. I know that a lot of the reviews talk about the service, but I thought the service was pretty good! The gentleman working the restaurant is an older man, with a tough East Coast attitude, but he softened up and tried to make light and friendly conversation in his own way. I enjoyed the service and it made me feel like I was in my old Italian relative's home for dinner. This place definitely has character and I'm glad I paid it a visit. It's hard to remember to visit since it's on busy 7th Street and you can easily pass it before you realize you did. But if anything, I suggest you stop in for a homemade iced tea and gelato. The atmosphere is quaint and charming.***************SKIP THIS LOONY BIN****************+++++ Owner or Management yelling at staff member++++++More yelling ..... different staff member   We put our menus down     My Wife, and I walked out        Why would anyone, desire to dine in an asylum ??????My Ethics .... My Standards:Every business starts with one star ..... GETTING MORE .... HAS TO BE EARNED.I will not be visiting La Piccola again. I hate writing this review and I really felt like not writing one at all. I feel like I really need to let this business know where they are falling short. I do want to give a very positive review of our waitress. She was in training, but she was attentive and was our only enjoyment of the night. The two glaring problems with La Piccola:The food: did not taste fresh at all. It was something we all picked up on. My cous cous was overcooked and very bland. My chicken was seasoned well, but not cooked all the way and my asparagus was damn near raw. Let's just say I didn't finish my meal. I am only going to review my meal, but the others in our party were all disappointed. The owner Andy: is definitely not a good front of house. He really should manage in the back. We were treated poorly by the owner, who has a rude and had an arrogant way about him. I didn't touch my cous cous and Andy thought it was because my palate wasn't sophisticated enough. He didn't even think that maybe there was something wrong with it. I think Andy believes his restaurant is earth shattering here in the valley, but in reality it is just another unmemorable place under the sun.WARNING:  If you go into La Piccola Cucina alone--with a coupon worth, say, $30--do NOT expect to get your fair value, because the owner will tell you that you are alone and not getting more than one meal.  Yeah, it happened to me.  I was stunned into silence and not in the mood to argue.  You win the battle but you lose the war, Mr. Owner.Food was well done, but cold.  Yes, I said cold.  Who puts a cold plate of food before you?  Obviously it had been heated but someone didn't get it to the table fast enough, so by the time it arrived it was not hot at all.  I said...at all.  But it was well made so I ate it so fast as I could as I wanted out of there.  Interesting that it was cold because there are only like 6 tables or so there and it wasn't full at all then.And I won't be returning because the coupon thing, frankly, just totally turned me off.  I have used a coupon for much more than one meal at tons of places and this is the ONLY one that just said you aren't getting more than one meal.  Always I get two dinners for my $30 and just pay whatever the difference is (say, the two meals cost $40 so I give them the extra $10 plus tax).This owner surely didn't have a problem asking me to pay the tax on my meal also--guess just making sure he gets every penny out of you he can I guess?This guy is just plain unethical and a rip-off, so decent food or not I'm not going back, I won't be giving him any good p.r. and I am really disgusted in his "ethics."Good luck to all of you that give them business, but it won't be me or anyone I know.(I just wonder how many people came in there at his required hour of after 5 pm and he did this to?)If every business owner pumping coupons out worked like this guy does I'd give him a pass, but he is the only one I've ever encountered like this.  Conclusion:  I am guessing that this place is just barely scraping by.  I will be curious to see if it's here by next year.  Why?  Cause nobody runs coupons and screws the customers so bad like this place does.I'll give this place 2 stars for the quality of the food which is really pretty good--albiet cold in the middle of the meat-- (I didn't say fantastic...but good).  However, not cool treatment of customers rates a 2 star, sorry!I just had a terrible experience at La Piccola Cucina!I've been to this restaurant several times in the past and enjoyed the home-style cooking.  Needless to say, I was very excited when a voice daily deal came out that allowed me to purchase a $30 food voucher for $15!This place is on my way home from work, so I saved the coupon for a night that I was working late - excited to grab some delicious takeout on the way home.One of the servers was in the middle of taking my order when the owner of the restaurant saw that I had the coupon.  He snatched it angrily out of my hand shouting "this is only good for 2 people dining in - not take out!"  I informed him that this restriction was not stated anywhere on the coupon that I had purchased and he shouted back, "I don't care!  That's the way it's always been!"  In a restaurant full of other diners, the shouting continued until I was embarrassed enough to leave...I just can't believe how completely rude and belligerent he was to me - In my opinion, this is no way to ever treat your valued customers.I will be demanding a refund on my coupon and won't be returning to this restaurant again.I really wish I could give the LPC a better rating, but it would not be justified. This tiny and super cute restaurant is only about a mile away from me and because of such I have been here about 5 times. Although I could give the restaurant a 3 star, maybe even a 4 star rating on a good day, it is everything else that falls short. I have tried the sandwiches and vegetable variety plate and actually found them both to be flavorful and fresh tasting. However, the service is just...awful. And the most recent time, I would say the service fell short due to the owner and not the waitress. While the waitress seemed new, she was super friendly and attentive. Well, as attentive as she could be with the owner calling her to the back to....? Not sure....I am sure she was helping plate/cook/something, but that would leave the 6 tables or so of diners unattended. The time before we were waited on and served by the owner. He seemed nice enough but also had to keep tabs on the back of the restaurant and would be MIA for long periods of time. There is no way that anyone with an hour lunch break could eat here and realistically make it back to work on time. Finally, I have a hard time using the Groupon vouchers I have purchased here. The same day Groupon was not accepted because they already reached their limit for the day? Hmmm....Sadly, I will not be giving the LPC another try but I hope they listen to reviews on Yelp and get back on their game:)

Review Text :
I've always come to yelp to read helpful no-hold-barred reviews but this is the first time I've been moved to write one of my own because no one should waste their time and money at this "fine dining" restaurant. Before we sat at our table we had a nice glass of prosecco at the bar with a very affable bartender - it looked like we were in for a great night...until we got seated with a server who was part used car salesman part annoying high school substitute teacher.  This guy proceeded to go through and lecture us on the menu for literally 10 minutes...we can read guy and we get it you want us to order the most expensive steak you offer.  This server (I use this term very loosely because we didn't get his name) proceeded to tell us that we shouldn't consider the filet or the fish dishes (really, Batali puts items on his menu that aren't good?) and that the sides aren't like Ruth Chris "you can't just order them" - what does that even mean?  So after mentioning that they keep many of the items in Italian to encourage "a dialogue" we knew that this was one strange place.  The night before my vegetarian friend suggested I get the buccatini without the pork and she recommended I get the small size, which is literally enough for one person but I should have been tipped off when they said they'll try and push the big size.  OK I'm a vegetarian and even though I'm going to a place called Meat & Wine I'm allowed to be there and eat what I like.  So after asking for the buccatini sans pork he looked and me and said he wouldn't do it..."if we start taking things out of our dishes it'll just get strange and I don't want to put a plate of strange in front of you."  I'll be the judge of strange buddy and don't bs me because my friend ordered it last night.  HE WOULDN'T TAKE MY ORDER AND SAID "I'LL COME BACK TO YOU!"  What happened to the "dialogue" he promised earlier?  Needless to say he hassled everyone of my friends about our orders saying zingers like "that's just 5 bites and won't be enough" "you have to get all of your orders in now because it'll just get awkward if you want more food later."  After we ordered we all decided to leave because we were made to feel so uncomfortable - these servers must be working on commission. I spoke to the matre'd on the way out who to his credit was very apologetic and flabbergasted the waiter wouldn't adhere to my vegetarian request.  He offered to seat us in another section - we just wanted to get out of this boiler room so he paid for our drinks.  If this restaurant wants to survive they need to chill out on the hard sell and let people order sizes and portions they feel comfortable with - even though I wasn't getting a steak for 2 I would have drank for two!If I was a good girl (which I'm not most of the time), and I died (which will happen one day) I would end up at Carnevino for the rest of my life.Nestled between three (no four, no six) of my most favorite things (craps, blackjack, the schlots, and the strip bitches)is Carnevino, tucked under the back escalators of The Palazzo . With high ceilings, huge windows, and an intimate, darker settling, Mario Batali has cooked up some of the best food I've have ever had. EVER! I repeat EVER! Carnevino is a must have on my list every time I visit my home away from home, the city of sin. With delicious starters, like petite fried cheeseballs delicately wrapped in a napkin with amazingly fresh butter, your palate begins to sing while reading the menu. The fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomato salad was incredible. The cheese had flavor I haven't had since Italy. The olive oil by itself was flavorful, delicate, rich, but didn't overpower anything. The basil was perfect and aromatic beyond belief.And then came the pasta. Parpardelle with porcini mushrooms with a fresh reggiano grated on top that was to die for. Perfectly al dente, with amazing texture and flavor, I ate until I thought I would throw up, literally. His steak, the larger fillet mignon was done to perfection, black and blue. Beautiful and pink in the inside, charred on the outside, plated, alone on a large white plate. Nothing, just the steak of perfection, seated, alone. You can choose a variety of sauces to come with the meat, he, choosing after my favorites, opted for the black truffle sauce. We expected a flavored truffle oil, but no, a full gravy sized dish came, laden with amazing petite pieces of black truffle, all nestled at the bottom. When he looked left, I dug into the sauce with my spoon, and it was true. They were pieces of truffle, no essence, not shavings, but pieces. I was in heaven. I could die now, or maybe after I make 50K at craps first. We were too full, and couldn't eat anymore, but our server, who I have had many times, recommended the pumpkin doughnuts. Anyone who knows me can answer the question, "If Danielle had 24 hours to live, what would she eat?" and answer with confidence, "Doughnuts". Is that your final answer? Well, maybe doughnuts and truffles, but separately of course.The tiny doughtnut hole sized bites were fried pieces of perfection. Crispy, covered with sugar and cinnamon, with a thick, rich pumpkin interior. It was like the best pumpkin pie you've ever had, on crack, mixed with a doughnut. Amazing! It took twenty minutes to get up from the table after that.But craps was calling me, and you know what I'm like when I gamble. I only stop to pee, drink, smoke, and eat, at Carnevino of course.I've eaten at Carnevino a couple of times in the lounge area where I've ordered from the less expensive bar menu, and have been thoroughly impressed (they have a better fancy burger than Bradley Ogden, if you ask me) so my husband and I decided to eat in the dining room for our first anniversary on Sunday. The understated decor is reminiscent of a simple yet sophisticated Italian country villa, and the general aura is relaxed and welcoming. Every person on the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the managers were gracious and accommodating. Because it was our anniversary we each received a complimentary glass of Bastianich's own Brut upon arrival (normally $14 a pop), but more notably, because we are locals, we received 15 % off our entire bill. I believe Batali is the only chef thus far to offer such a discount on a regular basis, and he should be commended for it. For an appetizer we ordered the pappardelle with 'porcini trifolati,' or cooked porcini mushrooms($22). Porcini mushrooms are my favorite mushroom. They are generally large and have a sponge-like underside rather than gills, giving them a kind of chewy yet slippery texture. When I saw porcini I got incredibly excited because the only place I have seen fresh porcini mushrooms in the states is at the Ferry Building farmer's market in San Francisco. While living in Italy they could be found everywhere in the Fall, even at road stands, and I frequently ordered this exact dish whenever I could. Needless to say I was truly disappointed when the dish came out full of shitakes and other varieties of mushrooms, with nothing like the porcinis I know and love. If the menu had just said 'pappardelle with mushrooms' I would have been completely satisfied, as the pasta was beautifully home-made and tossed in a light yet buttery sauce. Sadly, this misrepresentation showed up more than once on the menu. Our spinach side was supposed to have cherry peppers to give a kick, yet didn't, and our 'spring peas with pancetta' turned out to be snow peas. The steak was the real showstopper of the meal. I try to be frugal when dining out, but as a self-proclaimed foodie I am also willing to pay big money for something novel and ridiculously good. That something today was the 240 day dry-aged steak that cost $100 an inch. Dry-aging of beef is basically the controlled rotting of the exterior of the meat in a cold environment that results in the formation of a skin, or pellicle, that is then removed prior to cooking. It is an expensive process and therefore results in better, but less frugal, cuts of meat. Most well-marbled high grade meat is dry-aged for some amount of time as it dramatically enhances and concentrates the flavor, but this time can range from a few weeks to about the 240 days given the riserva steak here (we were told the slaughter date for our beef was circa early August, 2009). A second manager prepared it for us tableside by skillfully slicing it on a wooden board and drizzling it with the chef's recommendation of a little olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. We ordered the horseradish black pepper zabaglione as an accompanying sauce, but despite its ethereal qualities, it was utterly unnecessary and almost felt like a sin to use on this particular piece of meat. The inherent flavors of the steak were not powerful enough to stand up to it, and only by eating the steak alone could you truly appreciate the process and time required to create such a masterpiece. The wait staff described the flavor as earthy, but for me it was as if the aroma you get when you first walk into a fabulous cheese store (such as Murray's in the West Village) found its way into the meat and then ultimately into your mouth in a subtle yet obvious way. Combine that with the intensely flavored juices of the best quality steak you can buy and the result is unlike anything you've had before. As I continued to analyze the complexity of flavors twinkling in my mouth I looked over at my husband and saw teardrops welling in his eyes. When he noticed I was looking at him he said, "I'll cry over meat, I don't give a f*#!." I was hoping he was tearing up over how happy he felt to be married to me, but no, it was the steak he was feeling such a fondness for. I really wasn't hurt at all because I felt the same, and in all fairness, you can't have a steak like that everyday for the rest of your life. As far as Strip restaurants go, I would be more inclined to come back here rather than try some of the other celebrity chef restaurants I haven't yet been to. Usually you don't get what you pay for, but I felt the prices charged here were deserved. To boot, the service and ambiance were top notch without being stuffy. If you are looking for a special occasion place, Carnevino is now on my list of top ten Strip restaurants. For my full review, go to my blog.Italian + Steak. What a heavenly combination. From start to finish my business dinner here was pretty fan-freaking-tastic. Impeccable service and some amazing food. Having dined at most of the big name steak places over at Palazzo-Venetian (Cut-Delmonico-Carnevino), I'm going to try to offer some tips to help you select your next insanely expensive steak dinner !Pork back fat. Yup, that was the waiter's description when he set down a creamy paste called "lardo" and I said "excuse me?!" As disgusting as a paste called lardo described as "pork back fat" sounds.. wow it's fabulous. I felt guilty eating more than like a teaspoon of it, but that's ok. Only issue here was the ciabatta served with the back fat was only barely warmed over. Wine list. What a treasure trove of Italian wines they have. For those not on a budget this wine list is killer. Their beer list is also ridiculously good might I add, but most beers were $15+! There were only 5 wines south of $100 and the markup is among the worst I've seen in Las Vegas. Our $110 wine we drank retails for $17 . Over 500% markup?! Sick for even Las Vegas if you ask me. For an appetizer we only tried the beef carpaccio. Amazing and among the best I've had in my life. We got 2 orders for 7 of us and we were fighting for the last scraps. Highly recommended ! Before I get into the steak, I want to pay hommage to the mashed potatoes with a poached egg mixed in. Some of the best mashed potatoes I've had in my life. That good ! Now onto the..STEAK: I personally tried half of the "ribeye for 2". At $130 it's insanely expensive. Add $15 if you want them to pour some aceto balsalmico on it (ridiculous surcharge). The presentation was beautiful and the steak was among the best in Vegas. One of my dining companions is a steak freak and declared the steak here the best of his life. The seasoning, char, and preparation were all perfect.  As a comparison to other places -*Delmonico's ribeye isn't as tasty, but a WAY better value. You get nearly the same amount of meat on a "1 person" steak at Delmonico as you do on a "2 person" steak at Carnevino. At Delmonico the steak retails for ~$60. It's freaking $130 here. Yes, Carnevino's is better, but is it $70 better? I would say no for those that have big appetities ! *Tasting platter at Cut retails for ~$130. Honestly I'd take this over the steak at Carnevino most days. It's more exciting (having Japanese wagyu, american wagyu, AND prime on it) and I really do think the wagyu beef is worth the premium. *So basically comes down to how price sensitive you are, whether you want one steak done really well with a beautiful char, or are you looking to try wagyu. As a wagyu freak I do slightly prefer Cut but I know some people aren't believers in the magic of wagyu! Overall a solid steakhouse and the addition of Italian fare to the typical steakhouse meal is fabulous. Service was impeccable . I hope to return many times in the future.Glad we came back for another "snack" that ended up being dinner!Again, we ended up in the bar and shared a tasty bottle of chianti.  I was surprised, honestly, at how few chiantis were on the menu.  There were tons of super tuscans and other varieties, but maybe only 5 chiantis.  Weird.  Anyhow, on to the food:-We were given warm rosemary focaccia bread with a salty butter mousse as well as a 'lardo' mousse.  The lardo is made from curing strips of pig fat with rosemary and is quite rich; it is a nice addition to the hearty bread, but definitely in moderation!-Started with the Affettati Misti (meat plate, basically) and the  House Cured Pastrami.  The meat plate was decent, but nothing to write home about.  I wouldn't order it again.  However, the pastrami blew me away!  It was thick, peppery, and so good!  It came with a small salad of frisee with a wonderful duck egg on the top.  The flavors came together so well.  Yum!-With the pastas, they are served as 'appetizer' style, so they're perfect for sharing.  However, you can order any one as a diner portion for 15 bucks more.  We shared the Bucatini Amatriciana, which is still the best one I've tasted outside of Rome, and the surprisingly amazing Ravioli di Stracotto (duck livers with aged balsamic vinegar). The ravioli was to die for! I wanted to order three more dishes of it!  Overall, I was very pleased with our food and wine, which was served in these beautifully tall glasses.  I will return during my next trip!  Do yourself a favor and try it out!The unofficial Internet poker baller's steakhouse of choice for good reason, its great.The restaurant has two distinct dining areas.  The Taverna is a good choice for a snack anytime.  Lets just say the best calamari anywhere.  Lightly dusted with rice flour, fried crisp and served with a spicy tomato sauce.  Wow!  The beef carpaccio is equally good.The restaurant proper offers more in-depth choices of antipasti, pasta, and meat.  There is something for everyone.  Veal sweetbreads are impressive. The veal chop is incredible but at $75 it better be.  The lamb is also wonderful.  Perfectly trimmed and not excessively fatty.  Steaks are very good.  Table side service for the shared steaks adds a nice touch.  Keep in mind, this is not a true steakhouse.  Its all about offering high quality, land based red meat, prepared well.The clientele is very eclectic.  Well dressed folks for an evening on the town and on a recent visit, my bud and I in jeans and t-shirt off from a hard day of grinding.  Bottom line, they make you feel welcome.The wine list is well chosen.  By the glass list is equally good.  Prices are average for Vegas.Worth its baller status!Carnevino is Mario Batali's high-end steakhouse in Las Vegas (located in The Palazzo).  With steakhouses, the first thing people want to know is if the steak is good.  The steak here was very good (some of the best I've had).  Of course, a lot of these high-end steakhouses put out good quality steaks that are cooked to the appropriate temperature.  They tend to struggle with the other menu items though--the starters, sides and desserts.  Unfortunately, Carnevino is too similar to other steakhouses in that respect.Carnevino is huge and boisterous.  They keep the restaurant pretty dark.  The decor is nice and the seating is comfortable, but the overall look and design of the restaurant is nothing new (or impactful).  They do feature a large bronze bull statue at the front.The complimentary bread included cheese puffs that were good.  I cannot remember what other bread was served, but it was at least okay.I started with the big eye tuna crudo, which featured tuna sashimi dressed in a vinaigrette with a side of radish and cucumber salad.  The tuna was fresh and good though it was a very small portion.  Some of it was a little over salted.  The radish and cucumber salad was fresh and crisp.For my pasta, I had the fruit di mare, which featured spaghetti with a tomato sauce, lobster, squid, shrimp, and clams.  The seafood was a generous portion.  I liked the lobster and the shrimp.  The squid was fine.  The clams were just okay; I've had better.  The clams here were not as meaty and tender as I would have liked.  There was a little bit of grit and sand in some of the shellfish though.The tomato sauce had a little bit of heat to it, but it was quite thin, watery and bland.  The waiter said that all of their pastas were housemade, but the spaghetti did not taste like housemade spaghetti.  Maybe it was, but I have had better housemade spaghetti at other restaurants.I tried my friend's pappardelle dish, which was served with mushrooms.  We both agreed that her pasta was a little bland.  The texture of the pasta was good though.  I was not a fan of the pastas at Batali's Osteria Mozza (though the pastas there were not bland but salty).The main course was good though.  I had a bone-in New York Strip and it had a great char to it.  The inside was nicely medium rare.  It was juicy, flavorful and tender (which is hard to do with a New York Strip because it is lean).They also offer a dry aged bone-in ribeye for two people.  This ribeye gives new meaning to the word bone-in (check the photos on Yelp to see what I mean).  The ribeye was huge and they carve it tableside.  The ribeye was very good--great marbling, juicy, flavorful, and tender (one of the best steaks I've had).I also sampled a little bit of the filet portion from the porterhouse.  This was my least favorite of the steaks.  Maybe the filet was too thick because the center of it was kind of bland.They offer sauces on the side and I tried their wine reduction (Barolo Ristretto), which was oily and had no flavor.I did not get to try many of the sides, but I did try their creamy mashed potatoes (mixed with mascarpone and a poached egg).  The mashed potatoes were very creamy and flavorful.  The other sides sounded good.It was my friend's birthday so Carnevino made a big chocolate cake for the occasion.  The chocolate cake was rich and fudgy, but it was just okay.  We also had some of their gelato on the side (chocolate, vanilla and coffee).  The gelato was a little icy and lacked the creamy, smooth texture that is common with gelato.  The flavors were not that prominent as well.Service was good.  Food came out at a good pace.  We were a large party, but they had a large and attentive staff supporting us.  Before ordering at most restaurants, I engage the server to understand what are the most popular dishes and how are they prepared.  More often than not, I let the server direct me in what to order especially if I sense the server is passionate about the food.  Here though, the waiter was a little pushy.  As soon as we sat down, he was directing us on what to order, how much we need to order and so forth.  Service was still good, but the waiter was just not for me.Carnevino's meat was very good and unlike several Las Vegas restaurants I've dined at, I walked away satisfied.  Prices here (like other Vegas restaurants) were pretty steep, but at least I felt that the main food here (steak) would match up well with some of the other very good steak places I've tried, which makes Carnevino a good Las Vegas option for steak lovers.By the way, my friends said they saw Mario Batali (he was eating with John Cusack near the bar).The Palazzo has complimentary valet parking.  I would imagine like other major casinos that they have complimentary self-parking as well.Chef Mario Batali should cringe that his name is associated with this restaurant. For Carnevino did not even deliver on the basics on our recent visit. First of all- this place has a high bar given all the talk about it and the prices that it charges. It was highly recommended to us so we decided to take our group there on our last night in Las Vegas. From the moment that we entered- the place was not up to a "fine dining" restaurant . . . .and trust me- I eat out alot. Our waiter had an attitude from the moment he walked over- wanting to know "who was in charge" and tossing menus and wine lists at us. We appointed a "person in charge" just because it seemed without it- nothing was going to move forward. Everything we asked for seemed to be an issue for this waiter. We wanted several appetizers to share for the table. He wanted to know exactly how many of each versus just figuring it out as a good waiter would. Two of us asked to split a steak and to have it sliced- he acted like it was huge imposition but we saw it being done at other tables in the place. Our wine sat unpoured on the back table until one from our group got up to pour the table some wine. Pouring our own wine? Really? At a fine dining restaurant? Unheard of. At this point- I called the manager over- but she was not very helpful other than getting our water glasses filled. I expected to her to minimally check back with us before we left to see if things had gotten any better.  But she didn't.  She didn't care either.Our salads came up and were so bitter and salty that they were inedible so we sent them back. The pasta dish we ordered was no better than "Chef Boyardee". So far- service and the food were untenable for a fine dining restaurant. The best thing of the night? The steaks- but it takes a lot to mess those up. They were done perfectly and were quite tasty. But at $54 a steak- I would expect nothing less. This service debacle went on for 2.5 hours and at the end when we received our $1100 bill you can bet that the obligatory 20% tip for our server -who was terrible- was put right on there. Hard to believe.There was no other compensation from the restaurant for the bad service other than they didn't charge us for the salads we didn't eat. Plenty of good restaurants in Las Vegas. Too bad this isn't one of them.We chose Carnevino for our fancy dinner out during a recent bachelorette party. We were happy to find that they were able to accommodate our large group (8 girls) for dinner, but were a little paranoid when they told us they'd charge us $50 for each person that didn't show up. They were also really persistent about checking up on us in the days leading up to the dinner - maybe they have a lot of experience with flakes in Vegas?Anyway, we were immediately really impressed by the space. It's dim and romantic and very upscale. They put us in a semi-private little nook which I liked because we were still able to see out into the main dining area but still got some privacy. I have to say the service here was excellent, though I wasn't so impressed with the food. Our waiter was really helpful in determining how much we should order and making recommendations, though I did get the impression that he was trying to upsell us. If we ordered as much as he suggested we would have been too stuffed to walk after our meal! However, he took it in stride when we ordered only some of what he recommended. The meal started with some tiny little complementary cheese croquettes, which were a small bite and very savory and tasty, as well as a bread basket with choice of butter or lardo to spread on top, which I thought was a nice touch. To start, we had the grilled octopus and two of their salads. I enjoyed the arugula salad with a triple cream cheese but the other starters were not so memorable. We also went with the ribeye, which was yummy but to be honest nothing special compared to other steakhouses I've been too, both expensive and more affordable. We also weren't super impressed with the pastas we had - a black fettucine with crab, a gnocchi and orrechiette with sausage and broccoli. They were all fine but definitely not memorable (I just had to look up the menu on the website to recall what we ordered!) To be honest, the highlight of the meal was the side of mashed potatoes we ordered, which comes with a poached egg and some sort of bacon type meat. It was so indulgent and rich! But I was a bit disappointed that the mashed potatoes were the highlight of this extravagant meal. Though I was totally impressed with the ambiance and service, the food unfortunately didn't measure up for me. With so many wonderful restaurants in Las Vegas, I don't think there's time to waste on mediocre expensive meals!***Carnevino is expensive, but the meat choices (like the New York Strip and veals chops) as well as the grill octopus and lobster ravioli are very good***While I am not a big fan of Las Vegas restaurants, Mario Batali's Carnevino definitely excels at putting out great meat dishes.  We had several of their meat offerings including the bone-in New York Strip and the veal chop and both were very good.The bone-in New York Strip was a thick cut and it had a great crispy outside sear, which was flavorful.  The meat was very tender.  It was undercooked at rare, but it still had a good flavor (and was of course moist).The veal chop was better.  It was also very thick, but it was cooked more appropriately.  Veal chops should be between medium rare and medium and this one was.  The meat was moist and tender while the outside crust was distinct and flavorful.  Veal can often be a tad bland, but this one had a good flavor.  This was probably the best veal chop I have ever had.The lamb chops were just okay.  Unlike the other meats, the lamb chops were not that thick.  They were a tad overcooked and while they did have a decent flavor and were tender, they were just not as juicy as they should have been.  Also, the outside crust was not as good as the veal or the New York Strip.We had two other dishes that were also very good.  One was their grilled octopus.  I've heard Batali's grilled octopus at Osteria Mozza is very good.  This one was exceptional.  The octopus was very soft (which can be difficult with octopus) and it had a great flavor.  There were some good pickled vegetables on the side and maybe something else like prosciutto to give it a nice savory flavor.I have not enjoyed many of Batali's pastas, but I did like his lobster anolini.  The lobster filled ravioli was very good--moist with a great lobster flavor.  The cream sauce was mixed with tarragon and it was flavorful and fragrant without being overly buttery or rich.Most of the other items were in the just okay range.  The arugula salad featured a triple cream, but the triple cream was surprisingly dry and a little hard.  The bruschetta was okay (as was the big eye tuna crudo).We had the pappardelle with porcini mushrooms and while the pasta sheets were good, the pasta went cold quickly.  It was also a little bland.  I was expecting the braised pork agnolotti to have a more impactful filling, but it was not as moist or savory as I was hoping for.  The garnish of chanterelles was good though.  There was a little bit of butternut squash on the plate, but it did not provide the sweet flavor I was expecting.Most of the sides were just okay (like the spinach and the roasted beets), but the mashed potatoes with mascarpone and a poached egg were rich, creamy and quite good.I had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and it was okay.  I am not the biggest fan of flourless chocolate cake because it can be too dry.  While it was a little bit dry, it had a good (but maybe not great) chocolate flavor.Service was good.  The staff was attentive and the food came out at a good pace.Prices were high (which is common in Las Vegas), but when you share several of their dishes (family style), you might be able to save a little bit of money.Carnevino has very high ceilings and a loud atmosphere.  The place has the look of other expensive steakhouses--kind of masculine looking with lots of dark browns.The meat at Carnevino is very good and it is up there with some of the best a la carte steakhouses I've tried.  I am not the biggest fan of these steakhouses, but Carnevino is one of the better ones and they even have a few other good things (like the lobster ravioli) to balance out the meal.Carnevino is located in The Palazzo, which has free parking (valet or self).HAPPY and FAT. The operative words that come to mind when I hear the name Mario Batali. Sadly, the overpriced, lackluster fare at Carnevino only made me the latter! But, as a disclaimer, it has been quite a while since my visit here, so hopefully they've made some improvements since then. Located in The Palazzo, Carnevino semi-failed from the get-go. While it maintains the top-notch customer service and decadent, chic decor expected of a high-end Vegas establishment, the ambience was marred by the raucous sound of Beastie Boys blarring from the stereo system. I'm not neccessarily opposed to them, but the likes of "Intergalatic" and "Sabatoge" didn't jive well with the up-scale environment.  The menu was sneaky too. So, watch out! Case in point, the prices listed for the pastas range from $17-$31; however, these are for appetizer portions only. An additional $15 needs to be tacked on for the entree size. Also, the steak for two is listed as $72, but it's $72 PER PERSON, making it a whopping $144.  A steak legitimately worth that much wouldn't be for eating, as it should be plated in precious metals and embedded with Swarvoski crystals.We ended up ordering the Bison Carpaccio & Fried Calamari appetizers, 16-oz bone-in New York strip, Grilled Sweetbreads, & Pork Milanese. Pretty much all the main courses failed, and for an establishment that boasts "the highest-quality, excellently prepared steaks" I was seriously expecting more than the the chewy, bland New York strip that was served. The appetizers were actually pretty good, and I'd recommend getting the Bison Capaccio. But other than that, the highlights of the meal were the complimentary cheese puffs & the bread w/butter & peppered lard. Needless to say, this was a sad way to start out our trip in Vegas. Luckily, our night of debauchery at XS later on that night made up for it. Two stars!Even my MOM was impressed with Carnevino...and that's a high standard to meet.We came here with a group of 7. The GM came out and personally greeted us at the hostess stand when he heard our party had arrived. They had a beautiful table set up all the way in the back of the restaurant (through the wine cellar room, which I thought would have been a cool place to sit as well). With very high ceilings and paintings on the wall, the back room felt like we were in someone's old world castle. It was quiet, romantic and I loved the ambiance. Needless to say, service was absolutely impeccable. Some of us started with bellinis. The chef also sent out some complimentary apertifs. Our food order was massive:Appetizers:-Caprese salad-Stracciatela (proscuitto and mozz)-Grilled octopus served over octopus sashimi (my FAVORITE, the grilled octopus really was perfectly prepared and so tender)-Steamed clams (the broth was soooo amazing)-Lobster with the tail served sashimi stylePasta:-Garganelle bolognese (Because I was craving some sort of spicy pasta I requested the bolognese sauce to be made spicy and the chef added a very nice amount of heat)-Orrechiette -Beef agnolottiEntrees:-Dry aged bone-in ribeye (for 2 people) this thing was massive, I will upload a pic. We took the gigantic bone home for my Mom's teacup malteses. So spoiled.-Filet mignon-Lamb chops-Bison (available on their special menu)*Note that the meat prepared at Carnevino is prepared a little less than requested. For example, if you request medium rare, it will come out closer to rare.Sides:-Spinach-Mashed potatoes-Butternut squash-Cauliflower gratin-Porcini mushroomsI tried little bites of everything. We were all so full that dessert could not even be considered. The service and food were absolutely outstanding and I can't wait to experience Carnevino again soon.What a joke. I must preface my review by saying that I'm not accustomed to eating at restaurants like this, where prices are so high you need to mortgage your house just to have dinner. But I was vacationing in Vegas with a large group of friends and this is where they wanted to eat. So I gave it a shot!One quick glance at the menu and I knew I was going to break the bank. I took a moment to map out my game plan and decided on ordering the ravioli plus a side item so my wallet wouldn't take too much of a beating. My wife, also alarmed by the prices decided to order the gnocchi and a side item (quick recap, with a little wine we're way over $100 at this point. ouch)My first red flag should have been when the waiter pointed out that the "ravioli" was actually a "raviol-o" - as in singular - as in just one piece of ravioli - as in what the hell? I scratched my head. $25 for 1 ravioli?? The price must be wrong or it must be a huge, delicious, giant, thick piece of ravioli. I asked the waiter to describe it and with his hands he made a rather large circle. So I assumed it would be a decent sized dish. OK I'll order it.HA! 45 minutes later (yes 45 minutes) I was served the tiniest, thinnest, smallest ravioli you have ever seen. It was roughly the the size and thickness of a ritz cracker. 1 cracker. for $25!! Then came my "side item", also rather small. I wish I had a stopwatch at the dinner table - it took me about 45 seconds to eat everything. Roughly 3 spoonfuls and I was done!My friends (all of whom have large bank accounts) ordered many dishes. I was shocked at how small everything was. A a spoonful here, a tiny dollop there, and somehow these "dishes" were worthy of $50 price tags. I just sat there in disbelief. I sat there watching other people eat because I had already blown my $100 on my single ravioli and my wifes pasta. In the end our bill came out to roughly $200 - for two people who basically ate nothing and drank a little wine. It was so bad it ended up ruining the rest of my night. I was not a happy camper and while everyone else went back to gambling I grabbed a slice of pizza at the hotel (delicious, i should have eaten there) and went to my room to watch tv. Look - I understand that there are lots of people out there with money to burn who like to live that way - they're willing to spend $50 on a tiny scoop of pasta because the restaurant is "exclusive" and has a big fancy chef's name attached to it - but give me a break! My "raviolo" didn't even taste good! It had almost no flavor and my side dish tasted microwaved. My wife said her gnocchi was fine but she had tasted better pasta at small chain restaurants back home. My wife summed it up best when she turned to me at the table and whispered: this is the most pretentious place I have ever been to in my life.0 stars if I could.Things have changed a bit at Carnevino since the first time I went.  It's still a top notch steakhouse but if and only if you come in prepared and knowing what to order and not order.  I've had the pleasure of dining here a few more times and this is what I can say for sure:- Only go if you're ordering the riserva (call ahead), the dry aged bone in ribeye for 2 or the Florentine porterhouse for 2.  I usually go with the ribeye.  Sure it's more than the usual steak but no one should be coming here to pinch pennies.  Which leads to my next suggestion...- Don't be a cheap ass.  Outback is at Casino Royale next door.  There's nothing wrong with being frugal but your experience won't be good if you're trying to do it here.  - The sauces are a waste of time.  You don't need it if the steak is awesome.  - The filet mignon quality has changed since they opened and I don't think it's worth ordering anymore.- Think of the pasta as an appetizer to share among friends or just a pricier side dish.  They are not dinner entree portions and don't bother ordering it if that's your plan.  B&B is just on the other side at Venetian and you'd have a better experience there.  That being said, I REALLY like the Ricotta and Egg Raviolo with brown butter and get it almost every time I go.  The Spago is excellent as well.  - What's even better than great meat for an entree?  Great meat for an appetizer!!  The PROSCIUTTO DI PARMA 'RISERVA' is heavenly.  One order is good for 4.  - This isn't a very romantic spot.  The music is mostly rockin and the tables are positioned a little weird with that middle section making you feel like you're dining in a hallway. God bless Mario Batali!!1) Wine took 30 minutes to get to the table2) Waiter was more interested in himself and did a poor job representing the menu.3) Plates left on the table too long.4) Steak was bland and had no flavor,  I asked for A1.  Do not believe the hype.  This restaurant did not live up to the reviews.  I rather eat a Slim Jim than pay for a tasteless $70 steak.One of the most unique steakhouses in Vegas offering a rare culinary delight:  MONTHS aged dry aged beef.Read on, I promise not to talk about what the process really is.Called "Riserva", the once USDA prime beef is aged six to 11 months before being trimmed and served.  The result is unlike "younger", 30-75 day dry aged beef.  The shorter aged steaks retain a beefy texture, very tender with a pronounced nutty, bleu cheese aroma and flavor with a massive umame finish.  The months aged beef, think prosciutto.  Broiled rare to mid rare at a low temperature.  There is no thick outer crust.  The flavor is mild and nutty with only the hint of bleu cheese aroma.  The beef is dense and oily.  It has a very different mouth feel.  It is extremely sweet.  Amazing but not for everyone.Tip:  Request the "Riserva" steaks when making reservation.  The amount of aging doesn't matter.  The piece is selected when it has reached the correct characteristics.Traditional dry aged steaks are excellent.  The rib eye and porterhouse both possess the classic umame packed dry aged goodness.  Excellent sear, tender and juicy.  Both steaks are meant to be shared.  If dining alone, both the bone in New York strip and Bone in filet mignon offer the same experience as the porterhouse in a more manageable 16oz portion.All steaks are rubbed with rosemary before cooking.  It imparts a strong, woodsy flavor that enhances the sweetness of the beef.Not into aged beef?  The 20oz bone in veal chop is excellent.  Natural, pasture raised veal, it has a light beef flavor with a soft texture.  It's dry rubbed with thyme and porcini powder that imparts a very flavorful earthy goodness.  A drizzle of fresh olive oil adds the perfect richness.For starters, the fried calamari, "Shrimp alla Diavola", and Bucatini Amatriciana are excellent but why fill up.  You can get these at Batali's Italian eatery, B&B Ristorante.The restaurant captures the spirit of Italy, an enjoyable, casual, jovial evening.  Don't go with an elegant stick up your, you know.  The bread will make your hands oily and gnawing the bone is encouraged.Bravo!I guess I'm simply getting tired of the hype steakhouse / Vegas Hotel over priced lets put a top shelf name on the door charge exuberant pricing then deliver about 25% of what it is worth.  One of the most disappointing meals in a very long time. 9 Of us for dinner this evening for my birthday and we are seated nicely in the external wine room with a large table.  Asethically pleasing our sommellier gives us some reccomendations from this 500 Plus wine list that is so completely and utterly over priced I can't even begin to believe they have the balls to charge some of these numbers.   OK high rent Palazzo hotel you go with the flow.  A nice Pinot Noir and Super Tuscan are selected as we await our waiter Shep.  Some friend bread with cheese is presented along with some very nice hot bread with a variety of butters.  Bread has a rosemary type garlic topping very good.  Unfortunately this is where the majority of the meal goes down hill.  Multiple appetizers ordered Shirmp Ala Diablo $19.00 1 giant shrimp with a piece of italian bread in a spicy marinara sauce.  Specia Beef Cheek ravioli with a cream sauce topped with a drizzle of balsalmic vinegar was different.  An Angoltti was then presented with cream & mushroom..  other end of table had very nice Big Eye sushi tuna cut very thin told fresh.  House salads were ample not lacking in flavor. Entrees. 3 Veal Chops 2 cooked perfection 1 so fatty it was sent back and taken off the bill $85.00 each for a veal chop good but certainly not $85.00 worth and thats ala carte.   How can you serve a fatty $85.00 chop though? ....  Rib Eye steak again massively overpriced ok but nothing special.  Two veal dishes with musrooms were ICE COLD and had to be sent back.. Came back hot next time but so quickly can't imagine they weren't just nuked.  Pasta with assorted shellfish was fresh if not bland and a bone in Fitlet migon was probably best thing on table.  A non bone in filet and $40.00 lobster tail again COLD you really have to be kidding here. Side dishes were in short aside from the garlic mashed potatoes a complete and utter disappointiment from the fried eggplant, to spinach with hot peppers BAD.Nice zeppoles and whipped cream for the birthday boy for desert.   Service was on but they simply coulnd't handle how busy they were.  Goes to show you, put branding on anything and you can sell Ice to Eskimos.  2K with tax and tip when all was said and done, it I have to be honest this was truly an untter and complete disappointment.  Probably worth 2 Stars but with these price points, a veal chop going back, two veal dishes ice cold, a lobster tail and filet cold for all the Zagat ratings, all the clippings and my fellow yelpsters I DO NOT UNDERSTAND all the high rankings.. This is a DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY place that will never see us again.I am really baffled by all the hate for Carnevino in the reviews. I first came here about 5 years ago when I cam to vacation in Las Vegas and have been back probably 10-15 times since I moved to Las Vegas. I always go when people are in from out of town and want a good steak place so I have been with about 20-30 different people. Never have any of us gotten a bad item, had bad service, or not loved it. I am a unapologetic fine dining snob and until Gordon Ramsay Steak opened this was my favorite steak restaurant in Vegas- and for the steak itself it is probably slightly better than GRK (GRK has better non steak dishes and desserts). I can't wait for someone else to visit so I can try the new beef tasting menu. The restaurant comes from Mario Batali (orange crocs) and Joe Bastianich (the mean judge on amster chef). If you have been to any of their other restaurants Carnevino is similar in many regards- formal fine dining atmosphere, similar slowly paced service, the waitstaff likes to talk etc. This isn't for everyone- some people just want to order their food and have it delivered in less than 10 minutes without a lecture on Italian after dinner drinks (Grappa by the way is an acquired taste- I almost gagged the first time I had it but now I love it). If you do go to Carnevino give yourself at least two hours and have a backup liver waiting for transplant. The SteaksUsually I would start with appetizers but let's be honest- you are here for a giant slab of meat.  Here are the steaks I have had ranked in order1. Bone in ribeye for two. This is carved tableside. If you like Ruths Chris serve your steak at 1500 degrees sizzling deal you might not like this as it is served more room temperature- and if it is warm at all the heat quickly goes away from the thinly sliced meat. It is very tasty though- the seasoning is very light so its all beef taste.2. NY Strip- not usually one of my favorite cuts but I have gotten it a few times for variety and it is better here than elsewhere I have had it.3. Bone in Filet- superior to the boneless IMO- has the very soft texture and less beefy taste you expect from a filet. Now, not always, but most of the time, they have a special steak that is aged longer- if this is available for the love of all that is holy get it. Pay whatever they ask- 100$ a pound, 200$ a pound, your first born- whatever it takes. These steaks taste like nothing you have ever had or likely will have again in the future. They have an almost blue cheese like flavor that is incredible. I have had plenty of expensive food that I would say was not worth it- this is not one of those. Non steak Items- I have ordered a few of these - pork chop, Osso Buco, and they are great- if you are a local and can come here frequently I highly encourage you to try them. If you are in from out of town though, you probably just want to get a steak or you will return him and find yourself lying awake in bed, filled with regrets.Appetizers- there are quite a few beef appetizers. You can go two ways with this- some people will find beef on beef on beef to be too much- we call them French. So if you are worried about your blood test results get something else, if you love America here are some suggested Apps (not all of these are beef but are meat)1. Carne Cruda- raw beef good. 2.Prosciutto di Parma and Affettati Misti- picking between these two is slightly harder than Sophie's Choice3. Beef Cappallacci -this has some really strong goat cheese which is amazing but may knock your socks off. 4. Anolini- lobster pasta- whats not to loveHow could one not be a fan of Carnevino?! It's amazing! The food was excellent, the service was excellent, and the drinks were flowing. If you find yourself in Vegas craving a really good piece of meat, and have an overflowing wallet, this is the place to go! While the prices were a little high for my tastes, our traveling buddies wanted to take us here. We definitely enjoyed our meal, by far it was amazing. I sampled things I hadn't before, and it was all around enjoyable. The service was excellent, many different servers stopped by our table for different things, and each was extremely professional and friendly. I absolutely loved the corn side dish, it was by far my favorite. I also LOVED the potatoes with the egg (who woulda thunk?), that was amazing. The steak was great, if you have the budget to spend.I finally had the chance to join four others and have dinner at Carnevino.  We have heard so much about this restaurant from Michael U.  He set up the dinner with the staff at Carnevino.We started with some cheese puffs and then we were each given a nice roll.  With the roll came to spreads, lardo and butter.  The lardo was superb!  Fatty, salty, and just the right accompaniment to a tasty roll.Seven appetizers were next up served family style.  The items were grilled octopus with pickled vegetables and limoncello; carne cruda--their made to order chopped steak tartare; pastrami slices with two fried eggs and some greens; stracciatella; two wood platters of cured meats--one with mortadella, salumi, coppa, lomo, and nduja and one with prosciutto; and a dish of peppers, some stuffed with cheese.  With the appetizers, we got some sliced, toasted bread and some more lardo.  There were also more rolls brought to each person.Next up we had two pastas--beef cheek ravioli topped with sliced white truffles and gnocchi with fresh cut figs.  Next was the reason we were there--meat, in particular, their Riserva, a dry aged meat done in a way no other restaurant is.  Our two inch slice of Riserva was aged 254 days.  We also got a veal chop and a ribeye that was 100 day aged.  After showing all three meats on the table, they were cut table side and then placed back on the table.  With these meats, we had five vegetable dishes--mashed potatoes with an egg that was mixed into the potatoes at the table to make them creamier and tastier; Brussels sprouts, eggplant parmigiana, sautéed spinach, and thick cut garlic fries.The meal ended with four desserts.  We had some cheesecake, panna cotta, a chocolate, peanut butter torte, and semifreddo.The star of the evening was the Riserva.  The flavor is hard to describe.  There's a small bleu cheese flavor but the flavor comes from the oils from the fat that are in the meat.  We were warned to eat some of the ribeye first and then move on to the Riserva.  The difference was remarkable.  The appetizers and sides were good.  The vegetables should have been hotter.  Perhaps they were waiting too long while the meat was cut.Service was outstanding.  Our waiter, Shepard, was on top of everything and he had a great personality that made dinner a little more special.All in all, a special evening with some friends enjoying some good meat.  A return visit sometime is a must.Vegas is a city of decadence, and if you're staying at the Venetian, Carnevino is a pretty good place to splash down your cash. It's fancy and expensive, with a lovely upscale ambiance and top notch service. The carne and vino are excellent.I went for dinner with my family during a weekend stay at the Venetian. There were six of us, and we sat at a comfortable tucked-away table that felt like a luxury poolside cabana looking into the rest of the opulent dining room. Service was on point. Our waiter Corey was friendly and attentive, and he took really good care of us. The sommelier was also helpful. We asked her to recommend a wine and ended up getting a magnum of Barolo. It was a wonderful wine, perfect for our meal, and it came in the largest decanter I've ever seen, which the thin sommelier hefted around like a champ.The food was delicious, actually much better than I expected given the Yelp reviews. I thought Carnevino was on par with other Batali restaurants, and I love me some Batali. Our meal kicked off with complimentary cheese bread, soft warm puffs packed with flavor, along with some crusty rosemary ciabatta rolls served with butter and lardo. We then shared a neat spread of appetizers. The best of these was the grilled octopus with pickled vegetables and limoncello. This was some of the best octopus I've ever had, tender and meaty, firm without any toughness. There was some nice heat to it too--I think there were some Fresno chiles in those pickled vegetables. The prosciutto di Parma "riserva" was great to share, a large platter of silky prosciutto ribbons, served with sliced apple. We added gnocchi fritto, these fried bready pillows, to eat with the prosciutto, and they were lovely. We also shared two pastas, which became appetizer-sized when split six ways. The beef cheek ravioli was tremendously good. Delicate triangles of pasta came stuffed with a rich, hearty filling of beef cheek, all served in a butter sauce drizzled with 20-year balsamic vinegar. This dish is a Carnevino and Batali signature (I'm pretty sure I've seen and coveted it...Iron Chef??), but it is technically off menu. Your server is sure to mention it, but if not, it's worth an inquiry. The orecchiette with sweet sausage and broccoli rabe was also fantastic, the thick, toothsome ears of pasta in a satisfying tomato sauce.For the meat of our meal, we ordered both of the large format steaks--the dry aged bone-in ribeye and La Fiorentina, or classic Florentine porterhouse. This was a real feast, with both steaks carved up and served on enormous plates. Both were cooked a beautiful rare medium rare, red velvet with a seared, seasoned crust. They tasted different from each other but not in a way I could describe well, even at the time--they were both juicy and perfectly cooked, and I couldn't state a preference for one over the other. Just bring everyone you know and get both. We also ordered a couple sides--the charred brussels sprouts and the mascarpone and guanciale mashed potatoes. These were tiny sides, definitely sized for individuals, but we each all got a few bites of each. They were great. The sprouts were nice and roasty, with a pleasant brightness from the lemon zest in the gremolata. The mashed potatoes were rich and creamy, laced with face bacon and a poached egg.We were pretty stuffed by the time dessert came around, but we rallied and split a couple between the six of us. The chocolate peanut butter torte was a dense, gorgeous slice of indulgence, served with peanut brittle and salted caramel sauce. The gelato and sorbet was a great way to end the meal--we got lemon curd gelato and tangerine and blood orange sorbets, all citrusy, light, and not too sweet. About what I want after a whole lot of steak.This was an expensive meal (most of it was comped, courtesy of the Venetian's love of Asian gamblers), but probably worth a splurge if you're looking to eat and drink well while on vacation. It's hard to beat good steak and wine, even harder to beat good steak, wine, octopus, pasta, etc. I'd love to come back to Carnevino, and will keep it in mind next time I'm looking to go big in Vegas.What a fancy, upscale restaurant! The atmosphere, the service, the food....they were all so great.Before I continue, I ordered one of their pasta dish. Yes, I know. Who comes to a steak restaurant and orders pasta?? But to each their own....I was simply craving for pasta that night. Either way, it did not disappoint. Order the Linguini Fini (crab, jalapeno and cipollini...aka onions with a jalapeno pesto sauce.) Sauce was light but flavorful. And let me tell you: portion control was great. The dish was small enough to still get you full without feeling like gross and bloated walking out the restaurant.Boyfriend and I also ordered a kale salad to share as our appetizer. If you're a fan of kale, you must get this!!!!! Very refreshing.For his entrée, he ordered something that was not on the menu. He knows the chef really well and they prepared it special for him. Zucchinis with tomato sauce and cheese. Sounds simple but man was that good!? If I'm ever in the mood for something healthy, that is what I will go for.Dessert: Peach & Blueberry Napoleon. House made ricotta, blueberries and sauce with a layer of canoli crisps. Not usually a fan of dessert but wow...it was delicious and light.Let's start with the name.  Carne = meat and Vino = wine.  Yes please.   Needed to find a special restaurant for a birthday we were celebrating in Las Vegas.  As a fan of Mario Batali's restuarants in LA, I didn't hesitate to book a reservation at Carnevino, especially since we were already staying in the hotel.  In Las Vegas, its always easier to book experiences within the bounds of your resort.  Easy to do at Venetian/Palazzo.  Our dinner was absolutely amazing, and I'm referring to the whole experience, not just the food.  The restaurant is elegant and the service was on point.  We had a team of servers doting on us all night.  The food though, was heavenly.  Their steaks are truly extraordinary; dry-aged on site, then rubbed with sea salt, black pepper and fresh rosemary to achieve tenderness and signature flavor.  The menu also offers all kinds of beautiful homemade pastas, salads, and side dishes all inspired from Italian street food.  But trust me, this is no street food joint.  The menu is rich and sophisticated, with prices to match.  The meal is served family style.  I was one of a party of four.  We ordered two salads, two steaks (as recommended by our waiter), two sides- mashed potatoes and spinach.   This was entirely too much food.  The steaks were HUGE. The "charred dry-aged rib-eye for two" easily feeds four!  The "dry aged bone-in NY strip for two" could have easily served four as well.  We would have been fine with just one steak between the four of us.  **Beware! They do a hell of an up-sell here.  The waiter had suggested we order two appetizers and two pastas, in addition to what we ordered!  Here we are, four LA girls, and this guy's pushing food for eight hungry men returning from sea.  Really?  (insert irritated face here).** Having recently eaten at Bestia in LA (another fabulous Italian carnivore den) and mistakenly followed the waiters suggestion, I knew that was too much food!  What's the deal with these types of restaurants and the food up-sell?  Its annoying.  Even cutting his suggestion considerably was too much food!  I considered knocking off a star for this, but overall, this place is definitely first class, so 5 stars it is!  Oh, I should mention that the cocktails and wine were fantastic too!  We had a fabulous time at Carnevino.  This was definitley a dinner I will always remember fondly.Bookmark this one friends, for the next time you visit Sin City. xoItems Selected:Corpse Reviver #2 - Broker's Gin, Lillet, Cointreau, Lemon Juice, Pernod RinseGougeres with GorgonzolaRosemary Rolls with Lardo and Salted ButterCrab Stuffed Squash Blossom with lemon, cherry tomatoes, mascarpone Carne Cruda Alla Piemontese - chopped to order steak tartareDry Aged New York Carpaccio with horseradish, caper, beet relishVeal Tongue in Brodo with pureed parsnip, radish and lemon Fig Salad with Bitter Greens, Marinated Onions, House BaconBeef Cheek Ravioli with aceto balsamicoTagliatelle BologneseGluten Free Pasta with crab, jalapeno and cipolliniFried Eggplant with tomato & ricottaMascarpone & Guanciale Mashed PotatoesGrilled Corn with Pickled Peppers and Lime240+ Day Dry Aged 2.5" Riserva Bone-In Rib Eye90+ Day Dry Aged Bone-In Rib Eye Lamb Chops 'Scottadita' - 3 Double Chops with Sea Salt, Lemon Zest, and MintPork "Osso Bucco" with Sauteed Spinach and GremolataDouble Espresso on IceRoyal Tokaji Co. 5 Puttonyos 2008Chocolate Bourbon Budino with nutella cream and cherry jamApricot Poppy Seed Cake with dindarello raspberries and candied walnuts Balsamic Cheesecakewith figs and pine nut brittle Bowl of Fresh FruitAmaro CartA tradition coinciding with the Olympia each September for the past few years, it was with seven friends both new and old that another exquisite meal at Carnevino took place on Saturday evening, all the old standards including a particularly funky Riserva Rib Eye proving every bit as excellent as ever while a few new additions including some crafted for tablemate battling diagnosed Celiac Disease showed the versatility of Nicole Brisson and a kitchen staff willing to go above and beyond the call of duty to please.This time forgoing a private booth in favor of the lower ceiling intimacy of a back-room linking the two major dining halls, it was again with superlative service that matched professionalism to a (much needed) sense of humor that a four-course degustation bookended by far-too-many adult beverages was passed, a total of four-plus hours ending with TooL's Lateralus blaring loud enough to be heard on The Palazzo floor as the Chef herself sat tableside sipping Barolo while discussing topics entailing restaurants, criminal justice, and more...No doubt a night that will be long be remembered, not least for the food, anyone lucky enough to have taken a seat at Carnevino will realize that the primary focus of the restaurant is its BBL Beef and featured in versions chopped, cured, cooked, and raw it was both the carpaccio and veal tongue in Brodo that offered new glimpses of the Beef Tasting menu, the former so thin that "melts in your mouth" was expressed by more than one at the table while the texture of tongue was smooth and delicate, the pureed parsnips virtually indistinguishable from potatoes a la Robuchon in texture with slightly sweeter taste.Impressed by the crab-stuffed blossoms in rice-flour as well as pastas that show Brisson's years in Italy, as well as those with Batali, to have been well spent it was by two more meats that steaks were accompanied and although a trio of fatty lamb chops were as rich and gamy as expected it was the gluten-free presentation of pork shank that nearly stole the show away from the Riserva, each tender bite shredding to gentle fork pressure with flavors reminiscent of the slow-cooked pork steaks made  years ago by my grandfather.Generally going lighter in pastries at Carnevino than elsewhere in part due to the group, but also as a result of the substantial amount of food ordered during prior rounds, it was with three desserts plus a bowl of fruit that the meal found its ending, the creamy budino with cherries and semi-savory cheesecake outperforming a poppyseed cake that seemed to have suffered a bit from drying past midnight, though a great glass of Tokaji and complimentary education in herbal digestifs made such a small thing quite forgivable.*****Certainly not an 'everyday' meal in terms of both cost and calories, Carnevino remains in a class of its own amongst Las Vegas Steakhouses, the product and execution from Brisson's team on par (or better) than any found to date in the nation.

Okay here's what happened...I walk into the restaurant around 3pm and the very friendly hostess, seeing that it's just two of us, asks if we wanted to just sit at the bar. My friend does all the talking and soon we are sitting at the bar. This is when my first experience went to the crapper. The bar tender was the worst server I've had in a while. When we first sat down she was so pushy about the drink menu kept pointedly asking what we would like to order - when we finally just asked for water she basically ignored us the rest of the time except to drop off our menus for our food. We didn't get our water until maybe 10 minutes after sitting there and we never got a refill. In fact after she took our orders - with the most disgusted look I'd ever seen - she didn't stop by after that to check up or to see if the food was good. When we were finally served our sushi (she didn't bring it to us) we were missing a whole order but she never stopped long enough for us to explain to her. What I don't understand is how she stayed so busy because let me tell you, there was NO ONE at the bar. We finally had to flag her down for our check and even asked to get more water after we got our check. I realize that we were sitting at the bar and so I'm sure she was bummed that our tab wasn't going to be as high since we only ordered water. But you get paid on service and I am still mad that she was tipped at all. She was a nasty doofis, with a muffin top and saggy boobs and if she ever wants to make enough off tips to buy support bras she's gonna need to attend a few more customer service oriented classes. Food wise I was not impressed with this place at all. Is the seaweed supposed to be slimy? I will definitely give sushi another try, but I wouldn't go here.

09/07/10Came here on a coworker's suggestion.  He made sure I understood him when he said it was a dive.  Yes, Bill, I get it.  Once that was out of the way, he then said that this is where his family went for good noodles at least three times a month.  He's right- SB doesn't have much of an atmosphere, and it soon became clear that the majority of their business was in takeout sales (many were college students or middle-aged males).  So busy in fact, that my simple order of crab puffs and combo (beef and pork) noodles took longer than I'd expected (20-25 minutes).  The crab puffs were actually decent-- I would've preferred a toastier look.  However, they were nicely crisped, and not too greasy.  That is, after I'd toss them over a few hundred paper towels.  The noodles were tasty, and I preferred the saltier pork over the sweet beef.  (If only the noodle dish I ordered at China Magic the next day was as tasty as this one was!)  Be sure to have someone with you to share, bec. this entree won't taste as good the next day-- the noodles dried up overnight in the fridge.

L'auberge du Dragon Rouge est une institution ici à Montréal. Il s'agit indubitablement de l'expérience cullinaire et culturelle la plus originale de la ville. Des troubadours tournent autour des tables en nous délectant de leurs chansons grivoises et de leur bonhimie sans borne. Les prix sont très élevés mais le service, l'ambiance et la qualité de la bombance et de la ripaille, comme on dit là-bas, font de cette coûteuse dépense une expérience à recommencer.

Review Text :
Lovely little restaurant, lovely little surprise.  What a nice way to have lunch after a day of exploring out west.  Although small and in a strip mall, once inside you are in a charming red "bistroish "  cafe. The style is warm and the food is delicious. I  highly recommend the Lamb Panini  super good, moist  and flavorful. The Fish And Chips special was tasty too. The fish and fries both appeared to be beer battered .  Generous portions and great taste. Can't wait to go back.What a difference good customer service makes!!For my second visit I took my with daughter with me. I called before heading over to make sure they had room for us. The person who answered the phone was friendly, improvement right off the bat!When we arrived we were immediately greeted kindly & given an option of 2 tables that were open. The place was packed, but while our server was available, her co-worker took our drink order & got us started. Our server was WONDERFUL. Seriously :) The food was absolutely delicious. My daughter is a teen, & anyone who has teens knows that they are hard to please. I was a little worried that the menu would be a little too adult for her, but luckily that wasn't the case. She ordered the The Cabernet Burger with, what she calls, the perfect french fries :) , & I got the best Meatloaf Sandwich. To drink our server recommended a French lemonade to my daughter because I ruled out wine & she doesn't like dark sodas. The lemonade was a big hit :)The entire experience, like the fries, was perfect & we both can't wait to go back!After reading the "Best of Phoenix Awards", I had to try Amuse Bouche.  When I read the article and saw something about it in one of the Yelp talk threads I thought ~ "What is this, a French restaurant located on the west side that is actually good?"  Well I gave it two chances for my first visit was a 1-2 star experience and my second visit was better but not enough to raise my rating...  First experience ~ I wanted to try the "Best Quiche Lorraine in Phoenix".  What I got was a so-so swiss and bacon quiche that was runny and not evenly cooked.  The pie crust was exceptional but when I pointed out the runniness of the quiche to my server she stated "that's how it's cooked".  My quiche came with a side salad for which I was asked if I wanted some blue cheese crumbles on top and of course I agreed.  I did not know it was going to cost me an additional $1 for what should have been on top of the salad to begin with...  The salad was fresh, the candied pecans were good but the salad needed more dressing.  (see pic)Aside from the runny quiche the service was deplorable.  Loud 80's big hair band rock was coming from the kitchen area and filtered through this little "French Restaurant". My server did not know her menu and stated that my quiche was egg-less when I pointed out it was too runny.  My ice tea ran dry a couple of times due to my server and the cook eating in the kitchen.  It was somewhat gross because they were cooking other peeps meals while eating theirs... No hand washing in between, yeeuuh!  Second visit ~ I made sure no one in the kitchen area was eating and cooking at the same time.  I was also glad to get a different server this on visit even though I could not believe the other lame-o server was still there.  This server knew the menu very well and was very attentive with his service.  After reading the Yelp reviews I tried their Cabernet Burger.  It was more cabernet than burger...  You could not taste the beef and the caramelized onions made this burger too mushy for which the bun could not hold up to it.  The French fries were pre-frozen and were not good even with the onion aioli...I had HIGH hopes for this west side French Bistro but their food and service fell flat like a French Beret...It's a small world indeed. This is a family run business and this review is for the catering service and the incredible food and for the amazing owners, Snir and Kierstin Mor. Why do I say it's a small world? Well, Kierstin happens to be from San Ramon. Yep, of all the Bay Area, a San Ramon person catering the first night of Shiva in honor of my Grandmother in Sun City, Arizona and the restaurant is in Surprise. Small world indeed.Jewish rituals around death are to some very hard to deal with and can be very complicated. Due to the fact my Gram had been living near me for the past year but still had her residence in Sun City and due to proximity of the mortuary and cemetery and other factors, my Mom and I decided to use a caterer to ensure we had enough food for everyone who may come for Shiva( traditionally everyone who attends the graveside would attend) My mom still being a local had been to their restaurant and had contacted them when we knew my Grandmother's death was imminent. We were and still are very grateful that Snir understood without question that we couldn't give him a set date or time just a heads up and a basic idea of timing and what our needs were and where the Shiva would be taking place.How can one review the food for what gentiles would consider a wake? Well, my feeling is how could I not. I'm Jewish- I like to eat. I like to talk about food. I like to cook food (someday will get my groove back with this)- The food was seriously THAT GOOD. Snir and Kierstin were THAT GREAT and luckily we ordered more than needed as we ended up needing to serve the leftovers the following evening and it fed me for another couple of days. I can honestly say Snir made the absolute BEST quiche I have ever eaten and I have eaten a lot of quiche in my life. First of all, I am still amazed at how he was able to cater quiche that was so light, so layered and so perfectly executed.  I have dreams about this quiche (and due to the eating my feelings since my Gram's passing the dream part is no exaggeration). We also had 2 different phenomenal vegetarian lasagnas one with eggplant one with olives, a couple of different salads- one with kale and quinoa and one with candied nuts The dressing was amazing. The rolls were great and lastly the lemon bars (no left overs) and the pot de creme(too rich for my taste buds but everyone raved about them) were a nice way to end a hard day on a sweet note.   I will say that if I lived in the area and needed catering, this would be my go to caterer. I wished I could have had the opportunity to to their actual restaurant but I know that day may come. Knowing that the restaurant is in Surprise, I am certain that all of the chain restaurants around may overshadow the gem but I sure hope not. Toda Raba!We stopped in this small bistro while visiting with family in Arizona.  Based upon the Yelp reviews, I was intrigued and want to check it out for lunch.  First of all, it is very tiny, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amuse-bouche-surprise?select=T26UYP8c20EJZacTFySeFQ I'd say they could seat maybe 40-50 people max inside the restaurant and on the outdoor patio.  The lunch menu offered appetizers, salads, house specialties and paninis.  I decided to order one of the house specialties which was the Cabernet Burger. Wow, is all I can say about this burger.  I don't think I have ever had a hamburger flavored with wine before.  It was a half pound of red wine-infused beef goodness.  There was white cheddar, bacon jam and garlic aioli on the burger that just added to the awesome flavor.  It was very good.  Our table also decided on the another house specialty which was the Paris Baguette sandwich.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amuse-bouche-surprise?select=qTkDfiKalJ5zmmc4SQnIxg  Of course, I sampled this, also for Yelp reviewing purposes ;)  It was delicious.  It had Black Forest Ham, brie, Dijon aioli, hard-boiled eggs and tomato.  It was accompanied by a field green salad.  Lastly, we got the Black Forest Ham Panini.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amuse-bouche-surprise?select=f2sVvmOb3YfEOljygqSgBg  This was a very flavorful panini.  Upon tasting this, we almost thought it resembled a Monte Cristo because of the richness.  It had Swiss cheese, tomatoes and Dijon aioli on it.  I think what made all three of these things we ordered really terrific was the fresh bread they were all prepared on.  Service was friendly and helpful.  They were very busy when we visited and our waitress was tending to a lot by herself, it seemed.  I would have never known about this place, if it weren't for Yelp.  Glad to have found this little great hidden gem tucked away in shopping center in Surprise.

Mmmm! My kind of fast food. This is an awesome place for takeout or a quick meal. It never fails I always get the same thing. The Teriyaki Chicken bowl with brown rice and I add grilled veggies for $1. Sometimes when I'm feeling a little naughty Ill get a veggie egg roll too. The Teriyaki sauce is amazing, and they put it on light unlike most places that will drown your rice in it. This is an awesome healthier alternative to a typical fast food restaurant. You can always call in an order to be picked up in roughly 15 minutes. The service is always pleasant and my order has always been correct. I def suggest this place!

Review Text :
This was the first and last time I will visit this sunny establishment. Please let me start by saying don't be fooled by the name thinking you may get some spice in your meal when visiting this establishment. I would like to enlighten any potential consumers on the epic failure of the evening I just experienced. Failure number one, they had our reservation incorrect and multiple times mentioning that we had made the reservation incorrectly. Failure number two, your menu on-line does not match your actual menu. When you say you have Hatch green chili on the menu make sure you can actually serve it. Multiple times I asked about the spice and was told it was very spicy, and was disappointed at the lack there of. I am a lover of New Mexico green chili, so if you compare your food to it you shouldn't be light years off on the descriptions.Third failure of the night was dumping a full ice cold drink down the side of my leg and back of my pants. Not only was I upset at the fact you soaked my jeans, but then offended at the idea the server was going to get a blow dryer and dry off my pants. If I wanted to wear my jeans straight out of the washing machine, I would have done so but thank you to the service staff, they took liberty of doing that for me. So, you want me to take off my pants to blow dry them you say, failure number four. Epic failure number five was the sub-par meals that followed along with the "flaming" drink that is not worth ordering The food was by far the worst thing of the night, which compared to everything else would seem like nothing. If you think you are going to get food, turn around and go back home and eat a bean burrito.  After all that we attempted to salvage the evening with some humor, but then comes failure number six. When the bill arrives we were told that although the server dumped a drink all over me, nothing could be done to adjust the bill. It was just a little liquid as I was reminded by the server AND the manager. I wasn't looking to make a scene but when I stood up from the table, someone asked me if I had an "accident" (I'm 29 and housebroken). Even to this point, I was just annoyed. This brings us to failure number 7, when paying for the bill we presented our overly intelligent server a $50 visa card and asked her to run the card for that amount, and came back letting us know it was declined. In surprise, I look up the account information on my phone to only see of the $50 loaded on the card the previous day a $48 charge was in the transaction history for Fire and Spice. When we asked the server, she responded by asking if we had ever stayed in a hotel before and how there is an "incidental" charge which is why the card didn't go through. I asked for the manager at this point, who felt it was okay to tell me again that the bill was now being discounted because of the small spill on me. So after showing him the charge on-line he then got his second level manager. Oh boy, if you are in the mood for being told you are an idiot, this is the guy to talk to! Failure number 8. When you walk into a customer service situation as the second level manager in an issue, normally one would look to diffuse the situation and not escalate it. Not this guy, he enjoys full confrontation with customers. Not to mention he also witnessed the events of the night unfold and rather than offering to make the situation better, he chose the much higher route of saying that clearly our card was declined because there wasn't enough money on it even after seeing the transaction history of the card, with their establishment as the only charge. Nothing he said made sense and walked away as if we bothered him by asking for an explanation of the charge. So here's to you manager's of Fire and Spice at the Sheraton Hotel in Tempe, AZ.. keeping it classy and bringing in customers to make them feel warm a fuzzy inside. Beware hospitality is at it's finest in this establishment!  WINNING!!!!The menu selection got my attention to try this place for my monthly ladies' lunch (co-workers).  This place is inside the Sheraton hotel and in the middle of the hotel (openly) so you see all the busy traffic of people.  I ordered the AZ Steak Melt (shaved steak sirloin cooked and topped with asadero cheese) and regular fries.  The sandwich was ok, not much flavors.  The fries were good.  The service however was great.  But the food was just OK.The food here was nothing to rave about, but the service was superb, and eating outside by the pool under the hanging lights on a warm Phoenix night was awesome. Like I said, the food was just OK. I had a veggie foccacia sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was bland, and the sweet potato fries were slightly burnt. The waitress was really sweet and went in the back searching for sauces and things to make my food tastier and came out with a nice jalapeño aioli and some maple syrup for the sweet potato fries (try it, its great). I ate with 6 others, and they ordered a variety of things off the menu. No one was particularly impressed with the food. This was our second time here, and both times they were sold out of the duck tacos - the things everyone wanted to try the most. The waitress said they were probably going away for good sometime in the near future. We had two yelp checkins here, and were offered 2 free desserts (1 free dessert with the purchase of 2 entrees x 2) - woot woot for yelp check-in deals. We had the bread pudding and the mocha toffee mouse. They were both OK - combining small bites of them created a nice hot/cold dessert experience.What saved this place however was our waitress and the ambiance. Our waitress was just the sweetest girl, and genuinely wanted to take care of us, and she gets lots of bonus points. While the ambiance inside was nothing special, outside it was semi magical. The warm t-shirt weather night, the hanging string lights floating above our table, the blue lit swimming pool, red lit jaccuzzi, and the large gas firepit/fireplace behind us all created a sort of mystical pseudo summer tropical vacation experience (yes, in Phoenix). We may be staying at this hotel quite a bit, and while I'm not particularly excited about the food, I'll probably come back for the ambiance and the service.

This is the St Laurent location of the family owned and operated Jardin Du Cari. Same bare bones decor as the rest, with maps and posters pinned to the walls, same delicious roti with pumpkin. The veggie roti with pumpkin is one of my favourite inexpensive comfort foods in town, I pick it up for dinner about once per week, and I get the man the goat. Make sure you get the hot sauce that usually comes with, and make sure you're a bit careful with it. I love spicey and am always tempted to slather this stuff everywhere because it's deliciously mangoy and lemony but it's also badass burn your insides hot. The perfect antidote if you've had too much of the hot sauce is the peanut punch, creamy and not too sweet or peanut buttery. Like an inexplicable number of places in the area, Jardin du Cari is closed on Mondays.

It's quite a drive from downtown so I struggle to make it over this way often, but finally made it happen because Crema. After ordering up at the counter, we settled into our table and feasted on the cinnamon crumb coffee cake we snagged and mmm was that sugary goodness. We had planned on just tasting it then taking the rest home, but yeaa that did not happen. We finished off that piece of cake pretty quickly. With such a tasty start to the meal, we waited eagerly for the rest of the food. -scrambled eggs with sweet potato hash and whole wheat toast-an egg white fungus scramble with whole wheat toast and greens-a scramble of the day with whole wheat toast and greens-one blueberry almond pancakeThe toast was griddled up in butter, the greens were dressed, and the pancake was studded with blueberries. This was quality breakfast food. Throughout our meal, I was eyeing a little girl slurping on a very vibrantly purple and delicious looking smoothie, so I will be checking those out in my next trip. I've also seen pictures of the crema oatmeal and know I need that in my life soon. To be continued.

I'll start off with the old saying "You Never Get A Second Chance To Make A First Impression" Please read on.I dove and hour to get here! I was so excited to find another tart yogurt shop!Decor is minimal but tends to follow the same theme as far as these types of places go.I order a small tart with strawberry and kiwi (see pics) It had a nice creamy texture but not quite tart enough , I though the first couple of bites were tarty but then it just died off. Low and behold tell tale sign of cheapskateyness and robbing the customer was the hollow center of my yogurt (see pics) I really hate that and this is the biggest hole so far.My daughter got a small tart no toppings or so she thought, mid way through eating she uncovered ..............a pickle hair, pube, short and curly, whatever you want to call it. What a monumental Vomit Factor came into play here, did this have anything to do with the creaminess? UGH! He apologized and refunded our money and assured us it was too short to be his hair. But when you think about How does a pube accidentally make it way into a frozen yogurt batch? A bug maybe , but a Pube No Way!!I don't think I'll be driving outta my way to go here again.

Solid steakhouse, slightly dull ambiance.I had the classic steakhouse meal: some mildly-genteel Cabernet, Caesar salad, petite Filet and baked potato. The baked potato is GINORMOUS, so I shared with my date -- and it was plentyfor each of us (and I have what's politely called a "healthy" appetite).Everything was great. The Caesar wasn't fishy, the steak was fabulous, and the potato was...a potato (pretty hard to f*ck THAT up!). Prices were as expected: my date ordered the exact same thing as I did, but with a second glass of wine, and the total bill was around $170.  Since steak is steak, let's talk atmo: is there anything that sets this apart from every other steakhouse in Vegas? Well, it's SOLIDLY unpretentious, which earns it big points in my book....but the ambiance is kinda dull. Dim lighting, boring furniture, and not much in the way of decor aside from giant black-and-white photos of past stars who have performed at the hotel. The one over our table was of Miss Ann-Margret...but was mislabeled as "Charo" (!!!!!!). Overall: if you're staying at the LVH, this place is fine. But I wouldn't call it a destination steakhouse.

Review Text :
2.5 STARS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT $15.99 DINNER    Following hours of hiking up in the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, I decided to make the Santa Fe Station Feast Buffet my post - hike supper. This review is testimony that I should of picked one of a hundred other restaurants for dinner. I have a frustrating relationship with Feast Buffets. Sometimes they are rewarding dinners in Boulder Station and Red Rock Resort Feast Buffets or poor experiences in this Feast Buffet for example. This is my second time here in person and the first time as a Yelper. My first experience was around 2009 before the remodel. I attempted to try it in 2012, but in the 24/7 City of Las Vegas they shut down at 9:00 on Saturday night.   There was a moderate line to pay for the buffet. Nothing like the lines I have stood on at Red Rock, Sunset, Boulder Station, or Green Valley Ranch Feast Buffets. The $15.99 plus taxes brought my Saturday night special dinner to $18 before the tip. The deal was there was nothing special about this Saturday night special that was advertised steak and seafood night. There was zero value to the meal. Unless I was missing something I failed to find a seafood station. The only seafood I saw was the live shrimp scampi at the Italian foods station. Where was the peeled shrimp? I really dislike the steak and seafood gimmick that many casino operators use to jack up the price.    In general, there was a poor selection of food. Right off the bat I could tell a good buffet from their Asian foods station. I can assert that their sister property Boulder Station has a far better Asian foods station with at least double the selection. In reality, $18 brought me a couple of bowls of wonton soup, cabbage based vegetables  (where is the description of the food?), chow mein noodles, rice, wonton soup, shrimp scampi, cola, coffee, and desert. The food lacked flavor just like the coffee. I only took a few sips of the coffee and said, "forget this." Finally, the sushi that Red Rock Feast Buffet (similar price) features is nonexistent here.     A hardworking yet unfriendly woman served my two colas, cleaned the table, and served my coffee.    There are two compliments that I will bestow this Feast Buffet. First, the Halloween presentation of the pastries was neat. And second, I appreciated that the wontons are in a separate bowl from the broth. A major complaint I have in regards to their sister Feast Buffet at Sunset Station is that they frequently run out of the wontons.    Based on my experience of paying close to $20 for a gimmick steak and seafood night, I have to rate it 2.5 stars. If I return on a night when it is $9.99 and get value, I might pen a review update. In conclusion, Station Casinos is their own biggest problem. A few miles south on the 215, their Red Rock Feast Buffet offers far more at a similar price. Most likely I will return to the Red Rock Feast Buffet before I return to the Santa Fe location. In conclusion, Santa Fe Station Feast Buffet can feast on 2.5 stars.

Dude picked this up one night on the way home from work. They've been sticking menus in our door for over a year now, so it was time. We got . . . 1) Mongolian Beef with Fried Rice2) Quart of Hot and Sour Soup All of this came out to around $14.  Seriously some of the best fried rice around. Not too greasy. Heavy handed with the stir fried vegetables in the beef, which was great. No sauce overdose like that one corporate Chinese place loves to do. I wasn't expecting a whole lot from the Hot and Sour soup, but it was fresh and filling. Mix in some of that rice and Sriracha and you're golden.Can't wait to try out some of the other offerings.

Restaurant name  Twin Creeks

Review Text :
I first heard about Twin Creeks from on of my coworkers.  He's a bourbon aficionado, having toured the Bourbon Trail in Kentucky, being a Maker's Mark Ambassador, and so forth.  Bourbon's become my drink of choice, and he recommended Twin Creeks for their bourbon selection.It was a Saturday night sometime near the end of January that I made my first visit to Twin Creeks, based on my coworkers recommendation.  I went strictly for the bourbon, so I didn't dine here during that visit.  What started as grabbing a quick drink turned into me staying at the Silverton till 4:00am; yes, the alcohol helped fuel that, but beyond that it was the people that made me stay.  The staff is very friendly and they care about their customers.  Jay is one funny guy, if you happen to meet him.  The bartender that night was Joey, who was also great for both cocktails and for anecdotes.  And finally the regulars at Twin Creeks helped complete the social experience; you could tell the restaurant is located in a locals casino, with almost everyone sitting at the bar being regulars.  I knew that this place was something special based on the drinks and the people; I just needed to come back here for the food.On a side note, there is a very good selection of bourbon here at Twin Creeks.  You ask for a list of bourbon's at most restaurants and they'll probably respond with Knob Creek and Maker's Mark.  Behind the bar you'll find bottles of Pappy van Winkle, Elijah Craig, Woodford Reserve, Russell's Reserve, AH Hirsch...they had a good selection to choose from.  You can get a snifter ranging from $7-$50 depending on the bottling, or you can go for one of their tasting flights.  I believe they ranged from $15 to $35, but don't quote me on that.  They had a basic flight, a rye flight, and a more expensive flight that included the Pappy van Winkle 23 year (bottles of that go for $275!).  Of course there are the cocktails!  Go for the Orange Creek: muddled orange, Peychaud's Bitters, Cointreu, and Woodford Reserve.  Your palate will thank you.I've since revisited this restaurant multiple times, once for a friend's birthday dinner in February, and the most recent being last night.  The food menu has an area for "Twin Creeks Classics" that includes four different cuts of Prime Rib, four seafood dishes and four meat dishes.  These 12 dishes come with a bread basket, a house salad and your choice of two sides (baked potato, mashed potato, mac n cheese, brocolini or asparagus).  The "Twin Creeks Classics" ranged from about $20 to $40 I think.  If you just HAD to have a side I would recommend choosing from this menu.  The other part of the menu is a la carte, with your entree being served on its own; salad and sides are extra.  The first meal I had here was the Prime 16oz New York Steak.  I ordered it with a side of mashed potatoes.  The steak came with garlic on the side.  This was an excellent steak that I would expect to pay twice as much for at another steak house.  The meat was juicy, cooked medium the way I asked, and every bite just begged you to take one more, no matter how full your stomach tells you it is.  Bits of garlic with each bite added greatly to the flavor of the meat.  The mashed potatoes were good; nothing extraordinary, but also not something that came out of a packet and was microwaved.  My friend ordered a cut of their prime rib (I forget what size), which was great as well.  This is good prime rib that you are paying much less for than say, at Lawry's.  For sides she ordered the asparagus and baked potato; if you love potatoes like I do, I would recommend the baked potato over the mashed.  I'm not a big fan of asparagus, but my friend enjoyed it very much.The second meal I had here was just last night, and it was just as good as the first.  This time I went for the Bourbon BBQ Bone-In Rib Eye, while my friend got the Scallops.  The rib eye was again cooked medium the way I had asked, and it was just bursting with flavor.  In addition to the excellent meat, the Bourbon BBQ sauce was light and had a delicious sweetness that complemented the rib eye without overpowering it.  Me being me, I got my potatoes mixed up and ordered the mashed potatoes again instead of the baked; again they were good but nothing special.  As for my friends scallops, those were TASTY!  I believe there were 5 scallops, each seemingly the size of a golf ball, served in a white sauce.  I couldn't place the sauce, but my friend mentioned light butter, maybe white wine etc.  This was another excellent meal that makes me excited for my next visit.I like me some bourbon, and I like me some meat.  This place delivers on both ends, with a fun staff and friendly regular customers that help make the experience even better.  Whenever I've sat at the bar, I've been there well past their closing time chatting with the bartender and other customers.  Everything about this place makes me want to come back, which I've been doing at least once a month.Curse you Anthony M for not sharing this place sooner!!Never did i know that the Silverton contained such a gem. Their happy hour deal is a dream come true. Going to go into my style of describing everything i rememberDrinksManhattan- Completely agree with Ken M that this drink is potent. Boozy yet has a very nice flavorful sweetness from the marmalade and honey mix.Dragon's Eye- Wasnt too impressed with this one. They pureed lychees as a main ingredient but it lacked a lychee taste which was what i was expecting. To me this kind of tasted a bit like orange sherbert.Tiramisu Martini - Wow! Tastes like a boozy version of the classic cake! Epic Winz!TapasMeatballs- The sauce is rather pleasant but the meatballs themselves were nothing to write home about. I'd skip out on this one next timeCalamari- Some good stuff! the sauce is balanced perfectly and the squid bits were big and meaty with light flavorful breadingStuffed Peppers- Quite nice, the same cheese is used in the stuffed mushrooms. The balance from the sweetness of the roasted peppers and the savoriness of the cheese pair very well. Stuffed Mushrooms- White button mushrooms stuffed with cheese then topped with another cheese. Epic Win.Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Dates- Holy...Dude....These things...Wooo...Order two of them cause they're divine. Bacony, chewy, with a sweet finish. The blue cheese is good tooSpicy Red Potatos- Reminds me of cajun tuna or albacore cept with potatoes instead of lightly seared fish Bacon Wrapped Shrimp- Shrimp? No this place dont use shrimp...The use Prawns. Big ol prawns wrapped in bacon. Cant go wrong with that.Appetizers off main menuCrab Cakes- Divine absolutely divine. The butter sauce is quite nice and the cakes themselves are flaky with crab meat.Shrimp Cocktail- WHOA!! The prawns are back!! Again giant meaty prawns with house made cocktail sauce. The prawns lay on a bed of jellied cocktail sauce and thin slices of candied lemon. SuperbThink i found a new hangout spot.It was Restaurant Week in Las Vegas, and Diane and I agreed that one of the best menu selections was offered by Twin Creeks.  Neither of us had ever been here before, so I made a dinner reservation, and a few days later off we went with another couple.  After my experience I was favorably impressed with all facets of this restaurant.I liked the way the dining room featured a rock wall as a backdrop, which alternated with changing lit colors that were projected between the interspersed rocks.  The other lighting in the dining area was muted, and the restaurant reflected a modern but comfortable ambiance, with banquettes and dining sections that resembled living areas rather than traditional booths and tables.Excellent Pretzel Bread and great Chocolate Rolls were fine openers.  A chocolate start seemed odd, but no one complained as we polished off these tasty bread products.  Onion Soup was excellent just choking with Swiss Cheese, and when cut open spilling broth over the sides of the white crock and onto folded fabric below.  And so was a buttery tasting Caesar Salad.Refilling of water glasses was a rare event, and I had to ask for that and cracked pepper for my Caesar Salad.  But otherwise the service was efficient, cordial, and professional.  Extra Pretzel Rolls and Chocolate Rolls were cheerfully baked for my party on request.  A tender 8 oz. Filet Mignon was a fine entree joined with a very tasty Demi-Glace, good Broccolini, and an ultra-rich and creamy Yukon Gold Potato Puree.  And, a Chocolate Molten Lava Cake with a Chocolate Ganache center, and Vanilla Ice Cream thrown in by the house for good measure, was so rich and decadent that I was barely able to finish it, and was later awakened during the night by sharp "chocolate pains" in my gut.  No wonder, with chocolate permeating the meal from beginning to end!4-1/2 stars overall!It was another visit to Twin Creeks, and the food was very good.  But this time there were a few glitches.  At 7:45 p.m., the restaurant was already out of French Onion Soup, which I had greatly looked forward to eating.  And, on the first try only 1 of 3 ordered Lobster Bisques was brought to the table for my party of 4.  Warm Chocolate Rolls were as great as before, and a request for more was generously answered by a bread basket wholly filled with a second batch of just Chocolate Rolls.  I scarfed down 5 of the marvelous beauties myself.  Egad!An included Dinner Salad of mixed greens, cucumber, red onions, Grape Tomatoes, and Parmesan Cheese with Bleu Cheese Dressing was very tasty.  My entree of Filet Oscar was good.  But the steak was noticeably cross grained and between medium and medium rare in doneness after being ordered medium rare.  And, while a generous amount of tasty crab and Hollandaise Sauce was supplied, the 4 asparagus tips on the plate were all extremely thin.  Chocolate Molten Lava Cake ala mode was lip-smacking delicious, as before.  For the fairly high quality of food and presentation provided in a comfortable but upscale ambiance, prices are quite reasonable here.TC deserves an update and star bump.We went back on Tuesday night during their 8-10pm HH. I was set on ordering the Tomahawk, but with Jieun craving steak and me not wanting to waste the HH opportunity, I let her order the steak while I picked several HH items. Here's what we enjoyed.* Calamari $8 ($4 during HH)* Prime Rib Sliders $10 ($5 during HH)* Lamb Chops $20 ($10 during HH)* Caprese $6 ($3 during HH)* 20oz Tomahawk Ribeye $36* Two TC Manhattans $10 each ($5 during HH)I had almost forgotten how incredible TC can be. Everything was excellent, particularly the caprese and the lamb chops. The horseradish sauce that came with the sliders was a perfect accompaniment. The manhattans were strong and tasty as usual. And damn. The house salad that preceded the delicious Tomahawk steak is one of the best house salads I've ever had.TC = Top-notch CuisineSuperior quality. Appropriate price. Superior service. Superior consistency. Great happy hour specials (8pm-10pm). I bring the most-important people in my life here.A) SteaksServing certified Angus beef that almost melts in your mouth: 8 ounce filet mignon is what I normally get, medium rare. Also on the menu is:   10  ounce filet mignon,      8 ounce filet mignon with Alaskan king crab legs,    14 ounce New York,   16 ounce dry-aged rib eye,    16 ounce Kansas City,    28 ounce Porterhouse,    and Prime Rib (16 ounce King cut, 12.ounce Queen cut)   ... plus the 14 ounce Tomahawk rib eye...  Accompaniments include lobster, crab, shrimp, .... Sauces of three varieties, toppings to dazzle Guy Fieri, potatoes, sides, vegetables....on and on... Plus other entrees including chicken, seafood chioppino, lamb, pasta, salmon, scallops... And on and on... The quality of the entrees is superior, be it the beautiful beef or anything else. Top-shelf quality.B) TapasThe tapas menu is very strong regularly priced at between $4 and $10, and discounted during happy hour. I've enjoyed: wedge salad, meatballs, bacon wrapped stuffed dates, calamari, and prime rib silders. Daily specials mix things up. The portion size is rather generous, and the price rather modest. Truly worthy of consideration of "best happy hour" for the tapas.C) Personnel and AmbienceStable personnel keep this restaurant at the top of my list for superiority. Not only does the staff recognize and bring joy to each and every guest (regular or not, reservations or not), there is obviously strong and effective leadership from the management, strong and effective training programs, strong and effective coworker collaboration and teamwork and most of all: employee investment and dedication. Whatever is being done in this fine dining establishment should be the role model for all training programs of fine dining establishments. This fine dining establishment deserves to be recognized as possessing a level of quality I have defined as "unimpeachable quality".  An "unimpeachable quality" is and should rightfully be hard to come by and Twin Creeks achieves the status of "unimpeachable quality" because of the people that work here, the quality of the food served, and the management of the business.Twin Creeks in Silverton Casino is among the best dining experiences for steaks and tapas in Las Vegas, in my opinion, and compared with other similar restaurants wins the contest on value and the superior management of the restaurant.This restaurant is about "nuance" and masters the art. Beautifully.Desserts I have (thoroughly) enjoyed are: Crème Brûlée, Black Forest Cake, Molten Chocolate Lava Cake and when you order coffee, what you get is French Press to share between you and 3 other people.Great wine list, too! And superior selection of bourbon!Reservations are helpful.I used to love dining here. In fact we would come here up to 3x a month and spend an average of $100+ but, not ever again. Don't use the restroom while dining here or you will be accused of running out on the tab, even BEFORE you get your food.  That's right folks, they had contacted surveillance to see where I went, then had security waiting outside of the restroom. Like I said I didn't even get my food until AFTER being harassed.  Very poor management for being so accusational. My husband and I dine out quite frequently as you can all see by my Yelp check-ins (in fact we don't even check-on to all places we dine at) but, never have we been accused of running out on a check. I'm so upset with Twin Creeks and will spend my money elsewhere. I recommend my fellow Yelpers to follow suit so they do not have to experience something like this.I fought the bone and the bone won!I haven't been to Twin Creeks for many years, so long it was before the renovation to its current setup.  I came here because some friends had a dining credit from a pull tab winner they had while here.  They mailed it to me from their home so it didn't go to waste.  The credit would have been better used at the Sundance Grill or the Mi Casa Cantina.I was seated promptly at a high top table that would hold four people and I had a good seat for people watching.  I was asked about bottled/tap water and then delivered the iced tea I wanted.  I had looked at the menu online and I had a question about the TC cilantro marinated rib eye.  Susan, my server, explained that it was marinated 3 hours and wasn't strong with cilantro.  That would have been OK with me if it had been longer and I opted to go with that.  For an appetizer, I ordered the seared foie gras.After a fair wait, a runner brought the foie gras.  There wasn't much to it, but you get what you pay for.  The foie was OK.  There is a blood orange gastrique on the foie.  It sounded funny but it works.  It's light and doesn't overwhelm the foie.  The sautéed mushrooms with it were good.Then came the steak.  I knew as soon as I saw it they had overcooked it.  I asked for it cooked blue.  It was black and blue which means they left it on the grill on each side to give it a sear which had the result of cooking the steak too much given its thinness.  I was not going to go through the whole take it back and do another one but cook it less so I just ate what I got.  The steak was poor quality.  I literally had to fight the bone to get some meat from it and I ended up tearing the meat from the bone with a combination right knife with a left hook fork.  I would have gotten the same or better quality if I bought a rib eye at Albertson's and brought for them to cook.  The steak was tougher than the Cubs, too!Along with the steak, I got the large yam for a side.  That was almost the best part of the meal.  The cinnamon flavored butter and the sweetness of the potato was quite flavorful.For dessert, I got the crème brûlée which was well done with a good vanilla bean flavor.Now that I've been back, I won't make a return visit.  I have an open Restaurant Week slot to fill now because this is off my list--permanently!

Review Text :
Pearl for Happy Hour last night!The Beautiful Carin and I met our friend Cathy for drinks, small plates and sushi at Pearl last night, and we had a great time!We have been to Pearl a couple of times before, but not in the past 2-3 months, so time to review on Yelp!We sat out on the patio and had dinner the way dinner is supposed to be, we had several small plates, several different kinds of sushi and several martinis and sake bombs, and spent the better part of 3 1/2 hours doing it!The patio is the way to go at Pearl. The weather was great, the sound levels allowed for conversation, we got to people watch as the night went on (always fun to see everybody tuning up for a night on the town!).It was really a nice experience. The service was excellent! Pearl has brought on some new serving staff that clearly know what they are doing and how to work their stations, as well as bond with customers. And, one of the owners was part of our service team last night and that shows me they are clearly working to make sure that service is good, and improving.We had several different martini's...my standard vodka marti with a twist...well prepared, ice cold...yum! Carin tried the Deja Blue, and really liked that as well as the Cherry Bombs, and Cathy did the regular Sapporo Sake bombs (don't worry, kids, we were walking not driving last night;) ).The small plates were really good...we had coconut shrimp(2), bottle rockets, fish schticks(2), gyoza, karaage (2), as well as spicy tuna rolls, fake and bake, pearl necklace and captain crunch. All of the dishes were good...some of the sushi selections were more successful than others, but that is pretty much always the case, and everything got eaten! So, the $74 question is how much did all this gustatory excess cost? Well...that's right! $74! Pearl now has happy hour prices on a bunch of stuff all night long, and that makes happy hour into a happy night!Finally, the decor is pleasant, modern and comfortable, and we really like the girl in the pearls artwork...and not just because the girl in the artwork is the friend that we had dinner with, Cathy (yes, seriously...yes, for realz...no, I won't give you her number).Pearl is a comfortable and affordable place with friendly staff and good food. Give them a try!Saturday night and Pearl was turning customers away. They actually refused service to any more customers. Not because there was a wait, not because they ran out of sushi, but because they were short a bar-back and the bartender was slammed.The place was probably 75% full and the bartender was standing around, she didn't look even close to being slammed. I have never in my life been turned away from a restaurant because they were too busy, especially when they were not at capacity. I've been a waitress, a hostess, and my father owned a bar and restaurant that got so packed on Saturday nights that the cocktail waitresses could barely move through the crowd. I thought it was a horrible decision to turn people away. I've been overwhelmed by customers before, so I think I have the right to call bullshit on this. I worked at a bakery and coffee shop when I was 17 and constantly found myself alone during the morning rush. I took the order, made the order and brought it to the customers. I didn't turn people away!  I worked my ass off hustling and apologized sweetly if there was a delay. In fact, I even got complimented on how hard I was working by the customers themselves. The point, I didn't see one damn person hustling in there. If you are going to turn people away because the staff is overwhelmed, then I would expect to see some people hustling. I am so confused as to how being short a bar-back equals turning away customers.I will never go back to this poorly managed restaurant in my life. Just to be clear, I wasn't rude to the sweet little girl who turned me away because I knew it wasn't her decision, but the manager should have been out there explaining the problem with a little more diplomacy. If you are going to turn people away, then figure out the right way to say it so that they will actually come back. If I was the owner or manager, I would have done every job in the place trying to lend an extra hand so that I didn't have to turn customers away. I would buss tables and wash dishes if I had to. Maybe I'm a bitch, but I'm a bitch that knows how to get shit done. Whoever manages/owns Pearl- you do not. This message is for you:  Don't send your little baby workers to turn away customers. They don't know how to do it without pissing people off. Also, telling people that you are not going to give them service because you want them to get the service they deserve is a crap thing to say. You are not a fine dining establishment and according to some of your reviews your service isn't all that great. I guess I'm never getting the service I deserve because I'm never going back. What a disaster.I used to be a fan of Pearl until my birthday this year. I called a week early to set up a time that would work for the restaurant since we had a large party and never got a call back. Not once in an entire week. In fact, when I called for the 5th time to double-check that everything was set up, no one even knew what I was talking about even after I had called both the restaurant twice and Tammy (who I can only presume to by the owner) twice. In fact, rather than admitting they were the ones that dropped the ball, when I called the restaurtant the day of my bday (and also the bday dinner), I asked to speak directly to Tammy after attempting to get ahold of her for a week and she started off by screaming like an absolute lunatic into the phone. She called me a liar and said I had never called and completely cut me off when I attempted to say anything to her. Talk about knowing how to run a business...wow.Even still, I understand she probably had a lot  going on and we had a very large party, but that doesn't excuse her lack of professionalism or the complete disregard for any of my attempts to get ahold of her. The least she could have done was call me back to tell me one way or the other if they could accommodate us or not. She was beyond disrespectful to not just me, but also my mother who attempted to calm her down after she laid into me. She told her that because I didn't text her, she had no idea about my dinner plans. Really Tammy? After talking to your employees and giving them specific details in the beginning of the week and then personally leaving voicemails with you twice before calling your restaurant again? And not only that, but TEXTING you?! That's the most pathetic, asinine excuse for first off, telling me I never called and secondly, for running a business professionally. Bottom line: don't count on Pearl for any big events and don't expect Tammy to go the extra mile or even be enough of a decent human being to admit fault and try to fix the situation. Way to lose nearly 30 patrons in one night.I have not left a dining establishment as upset as I was when I left Pearl. The experience I had as absolutely horrible. I am not one to make a big deal about nothing and I, more often than not, give people the benefit of the doubt, but I can honestly say I was shocked and EXTREMELY furious after my visit. I bought a localdines certificate to go to Pearl and have been dying to try the place out. They have a great menu and it is in a fun location. The terms on the localdine clearly state that it is ONLY VALID MON-THURS. We went on Tuesday at 7pm, sat down,  I pulled out the coupon and was promptly told by the bartender "we dont accept those on tuesdays" then he walked off. Let me also clarify that while it was 7pm it was not crowded or busy. There was NO ONE else sitting at the bar with us. I waited for him to come back so I could show him that it clearly says on there that it is Valid ONLY MON-THURS. He then notified me that it was in fact NOT valid on Tues or Thurs because they have specials. I explained to him that we drove more than 30 minutes to get there and we could order off the main menu and not get any of the specials if that would be ok....He said it was out of his hands and he couldnt do anything and walked off. A female server chimed in that "there's nothing we can do to help you, its just how it is" then she also just walked away. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Not a SINGLE person was willing to talk to us and explain things or give us 2 minutes of their time. The customer service was absolutely ridiculous. I have NEVER been treated so rudely in a situation that I clearly had a right for clarification. Today 10/5/2011 I see that Localdines is featuring Pearl with the SAME coupon that clearly states VALID ONLY MON-THURS. Needless to say, I am making it a point to write a very appropriately rude review about this place. The menu looks amazing, many people have written reviews about the great food....I however, never had a chance to try the food because I couldnt get past the servers who made us feel like we weren't worth their time. Save yourself the snotty Scottsdale attitude and go to Ra, Stingray, Sapporo or Sushi Brokers....they will not only serve you good sushi, they will also be polite.

NOTE: [Every time you read the word "Groupon", you have to take a shot.]I've been here several times, but haven't felt the need to write a review until tonight's experience.  Let me preface, that most everyone's dinner was 4 to 5 star.  Everyone raved about the panko fried fish.  The food was exceptional, except for the fried shrimp, which was overcooked.Let take this step by step.  First, when my wife called, the woman who answered the phone was very rushed, and hung up on my wife as soon as she completed her order, but before she could ask a few questions.  OK, they're probably pretty busy, but they should know that they're going to turn off customers with poor service.I rolled up with a $20 Groupon in hand, and the woman working the counter (who presumably was the same woman answering the phone) let me know, in no uncertain terms, that the Groupon deal was costing her money (now I'll assume that she is the owner).She complained that patrons would tell her that the menu prices are too expensive, but that once the company offers a Groupon deal, the same people show up with a Groupon, and they usually have a line out the door.  Then she mentioned that the economy must be pretty bad for so many people to get in on the Groupon, and asked me where I acquired my Groupon deal.  I replied, "The internet".Trying to make her feel a tad better about this losing proposition, I reminded her that the benefit of the Groupon was to bring in new clientele.  She said that the deal does bring in a lot of business, but that she lost money on all that businessI replied that the payoff would be return-business, and she said something to the effect of, "Yeah, most Groupon people don't come back.  What about you?  Am I going to get your return business?"My plea to the proprietors of this location would be:1. Don't complain to the customer about the promotional deal they show up with.  If you must complain, then complain to the people at corporate who entered into the Groupon deal.  NEVER complain to the customer.2. Don't be rude to your customer.  I know if may be hard to hold your tongue, and you're probably really busy, and you're a little overwhelmed at the prospect of not getting compensated for your hard work, but you can pretty much ensure a customer wont return if you're rude to them.I think this location serves great food, they just need to get their customer service in order.  I want to see this business thrive, because I like their product.  C'mon guys, don't ruin it with poor, preventable choices.

Restaurant name  Shucks Tavern & Oyster Bar

Review Text :
I used to love Shucks, and it was my go-to neighborhood bar. Back in the day, they had fantastic 2lb crab buckets for under $30. When people would ask me my favorite thing about Las Vegas, those affordable crab buckets would be part of my reply- mostly because you can order them 24 hrs a day. Crab at 3am? Why not?Those  days are long gone now. The menu has changed, the late night specials have changed, the bar staff has changed. They used to offer a great late night menu after midnight (pics posted) but no more, now it's just breakfast. There's two bartenders who work there late night, one is a darling, the other who is newer is so rude.The crab is now $9 for 1/2 a pound, which is  just kind of silly. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's only so-so. The tuna is previously frozen, which is what you would expect from a place like this and sometimes it's okay, sometimes it's inedible. The oysters seem to be popular but they're gulf oysters which really isn't my thing.I used to love this place and would come at least a couple of times a week, but no longer. I'll still drop in once in a while if the bartender I like is working. And it's still a great place to get seafood late at night, but for your bar needs? You can do better.Just had the worst experience at Shucks after being a long term customer. Arrived and took a seat at the bar, thought I would order dinner. Was promptly greeted and given a menu then asked If I would like something to drink. Ordered a drink and took a look at the menu. The female wait person went back to talking with her friend and play on her cell phone about THREE FEET away. Since I have eaten at Shucks many times, I knew what I wanted to order. The wait person continued to talk and play for another ten minutes. A short time later another customer arrived and took a seat next to the other customer. Now there are three customers sitting next to each other at the bar and the wait person continues to talk and play on her cell phone all the time ignoring me. I thought I would give it a little time and see if this waiter is interested in taking my order. After sitting again, three feet away from the wait person and never being given the opportunity to order dinner. I got up and walked out. That was fifteen minutes of wasted time. This female waiter has got to be the worst example of how to treat customers. She was more interested in her cell phone and talking with her friends rather than do her job.  My pervious experiences with Shucks over the years has been very good. Honestly, I don't know if I will ever return again.If it were possible to give zero stars after this experience I would give it negative stars.Fridays is the best day to come here- they offer daily specials, but Friday's choices are by far the best value. You can pick orders of crawfish, mussels, crab cocktail, or crab & spinach dip for a flat $5 each. And did I mention martinis are half off ($10 each down to $5)? And they don't halve the portions for the specials, we're talking gigantic, full orders, for minimal money.CRAB COCKTAIL: It's crab, the portion isn't huge but it's fresh and tasty, and you can't beat $5 (regularly ~$10?). Order one per person, or whoever gets their hands on it first is going to eat the whole thing.MUSSELS: Large portion, white wine sauce. Not the best sauce, but again, you can't beat the value for the price/portion. Easily a meal for one, and sided with a piece of their addictively-good garlic cheese bread.CRAWFISH: Available depending on the season, also sided with the bread. Not nearly as good as other places in town, though it isn't the easiest dish to find in the first place. Wouldn't get again, but it's not necessarily bad.MARTINITS: The "dirty shucker" is a classic dirty martini, done well but the Chocolate Salted Pretzel is the stuff of legends. See Lisa H's review for more coverage, but it's something you have to try at least once. Fridays, for $5, is the best night to do so.Service was friendly, and the bar is lined with TVs, making it a good spot to watch the game. Draft domestics were ~$4 while bottled specialty beers were about $5. In addition to all this money-saving awesomeness, Shucks is open 24/7!

Review Text :
I just love Xtreme Sushi! This time the chefs were different, since the normal chef/owner was his day off (he is our favorite).  However the chef we had was pretty good, a little slower than our normal chef but I am rating for quality of the nigiri sushi and the idea of AYCE of everything on menu (except sashimi of course and hamachi Kama) is fantastic! They only had 2 servers last night, but they did pretty well considering they were really and hectically busy. The restaurant was full and I noticed that they were forgetting someone's order, but obviously the customers patiently waited with out complaints.  They must be there for the same reason that we were, for the fresh quality of fish and AYCE of everything on menu! Appetizers:Fried Soft shell Crab - very good, crunchy and tastyFried Calamari - The BF's favorite, he is Italian and says that it's better than most Italian calamarisFried shumai and steamed shumai - I prefer the fried shumai than the steamedShrimp Tempura - love their tempura, this is when we noticed that the 2 servers were a little frazzled because it took a while for them to get our tempura sauce. I ate mine without the sauce and no complaints. Teriyaki Steak - The BF said that they put too much sauce, but the steak was really good.Baked Muscles - Oh goodness, can't have this without our sushi! I love the sauce especially when I slurp the muscle and sauce all in one breathe! It's so steamy hot and delicious!Nigiri Sushi -Yellowtail - Oh my gosh! We have never seen any chef take a whole fresh fish from the back and cut it how they are suppose to for Nigiri's. What a treat and pleasure to see! We ordered a total of 5 orders of fresh Hamachi and it was soooooo fresh and delicious! White Tuna - This is one of our favorites! It's so darn good that it just melts in your mouth! We had 4 orders.Red Snapper with slice of Jalapeno on top - We first discovered red snapper nigiri with the Jalapeno on top while we were in Cebu Philippines at our friend's restaurant. Ever since we fell in love and snapper with the spicy crunch of Jalapeno is just so damn good! We had 2 orders.Uni - I love love and it tasted so fresh and yummy, although my bf doesn't like it because of the texture.Surf Clam - This was okay, but I ate it anyway.Salmon  with avocado and smelt eggs on top - This was my BF's creation and I was so surprised how good this was! I even squeezed a little fresh lemon over it and it was awesome!! Smelt Eggs and Ikura - These were both good and fresh, when it is too fishy it's not so fresh but it was just right (we learned this from Japan)Unagi - It is as good as it gets, especially how they always listen when request for extra crispy.Salmon Skin Handroll - This is the only thing that was off. I guess it depends on the chef. It's usually crispy salmon skin, but he made it with the salmon meat and a little bit of skin which was not too crispy. Don't get me wrong, but it was still really good!Baked Scallops and salmon with Eel sauce and Siracha - This was my creation and it was really good! Amaebi with fried shrimp heads - Very fresh and sweet and a great combo with the crispy shrimp heads! I really wanted to try the rolls, especially because you can order half orders also with appetizers and nigiri! This is why I love Xtreme, because although there are rules, they don't disappoint me when I want to order little by little. Next time I have to try the special and Xtreme rolls in half orders, which comes in 4 rolls instead of 8!Still I haven't met your match, therefore I still love you Xtreme!This in my opinion is a top quality AYCE sushi restaurant in Las Vegas.  Even if it is really far from where I currently live in Las Vegas.  Driving out here is almost like driving back to California, you are near South Point Casino and M Resort.But if you are in the area, and looking to eat some of the very best sushi in Las Vegas, this is one of the spots I recommend you hit up.Pricewise, it is fairly reasonable.  $19.95 for AYCE lunch (until 3pm) and $25.95 for dinner.  Kids AYCE is priced at $11.95.  And you can order just about everything from their extensive menu (except sashimi and single orders on the regular items like uni, amaebi, etc.).The restaurant is on the small side, but the decor was nice. My friend thought it was better than Sushi Mon.Food was delicious, fish was fresh and fried items like calamari were baked just right (still moist and not overcooked and rubbery).  Service was pretty good for our group of 8. And we were not rushed or anything even though we were there for a good 2+ hours, eating, drinking, and eating some more.These are what I particularly enjoyed:* Teriyaki Beef (possibly one of the best in Las Vegas, perhaps a little sauced but the beef itself was great).* Calamari (prepared just right!)* Sushi Poki Salad (fish were fresh)* Fried Soft Shell Crab - so good we ordered seconds.* Baked Muscles - one of the better ones available in LV.* Uni, Hamachi and Super White Tuna - must have in my book.If you are in a large group, you will likely be automatically charged the 18% gratuity. Which is cool, since there appears to be no time limit to our AYCE dinner.If you have never tried Japanese food, this is the place for you to experiment with the sushi and other menu items. The option to order everything but the sashimi in the entire menu, is great for adventurous beginners to get a taste of everything and find out what they like or don't like.

Surprisingly well-priced meals for a little restaurant in old montreal. Wouldn't rank it in the top for dining in old montreal since there are so many impressive restaurants around, but the food is quite good. Me and my friends love this restaurant because the meals are fairly cheap and its bring your own wine which saves a lot of money. Service is always great despite us being a bunch of uni kids. Also the menu satisfies everyone.

Review Text :
With a name like Cheeburger times 2, you don't have to guess what their specialty is.  What most diners in the area don't know is that Cheeburger Cheeburger is actually a chain with over 50 locations!  Walking in, newbies will be surprised by the 50s-inspired diner atmosphere.  Their menu definitely takes some time to navigate, but you'll get the hang of it.Burgers - their main focus and what everyone really comes for.  You can have your meat cooked to your liking (medium, medium well, well) and in various sizes (5.5 oz, 7 oz, 10 oz, 14 oz).  Apparently, they have their own farm where the beef comes from.  What makes them over the top is the number of toppings available.  Things like sun-dried tomatoes, avocado, and artichoke hearts are only a sample of their 25 plus topping selection.  The Husband went for The Semi-Serious (7 oz) for $6.99.  With nine types of cheeses to choose from, he went for the Pepper Jack Cheese and a fair amount of toppings.  Melissa G. went for The Classic (5.5 oz) Wrap for $6.79.  She also added a few toppings too.If it's not meat you crave, portabello mushroom and veggie burgers and wraps are also available.  Salads are also hearty on the toppings with over 25 choices to choose from.  I went for the Portabello Wrap for $7.99.  They offer white or whole wheat wraps and you get a signature sauce to dip your wrap in.  My wrap was okay, perhaps there's so much stuff going on that it's hard to enjoy the actual taste of the wrap itself.We couldn't resist their "Famous Fries & Rings" and wanted to go for the "Best of Both" Basket, Regular order ($5.89), but the waitress dissuaded us by saying it was huge and we should really get a Half ($4.69).  Apparently, she underestimated our craving for fried foods, and we ended up ordering up another basket of fries (Small $2.59 / Medium $3.59 / Large $4.59).  We weren't too fond of the onion rings, but we did like the fries.  They also offer five signature sauces, so we did the Adventurous Flight of Three ($2.49).  Since two of us ordered wraps, we ended up trying all five - Creamy Cheese, Zesty Horseradish, Creamy Jalapeno, Sweet Pepper, and Garden Vegetable.  We overdid it with the sauces and maybe should have just chosen one for our fries.  They weren't anything special unfortunately.  But the real winner is their milkshake selection.  With over 378,00 possible combinations, you can build any kind of milkshake you want.  The waitress did point out that once you get past the three topping combination, there's an excess of syrup as most of the toppings are syrup-based. (So, be sure to ask the staff what toppings are concrete versus syrup.)  I went for the Oreo Green Mint, Cookie Dough, and Heath Bar combination and it was REALLY good.  The Husband went for the Pina Colada and Berry Berry combo and his was pretty good too!  Melissa G. has Chocolate Banana Peanut Butter with Reese's Pieces.  They serve them up in two sizes - Half $3.59 or Regular $4.99.  Service was okay, the waitresses were super friendly in the beginning but slacked off a bit as more business arrived and our section was left empty.  (We were seated in the back section, although they ended up closing it off and seating everyone else in the front.)When it comes down to it, we paid over $50 for dinner and that was not including tip.  Pretty expensive meal for a party of three at a diner.  For those who know what toppings to pick, you can get a better bang for your buck.  But if you prefer the no frills on your burgers, this place is not for you.  We'd go back for the shakes and fries, but not for the rings, burgers or wraps.Since I won't be able to make the UYE Cheeburger Cheeburger Challenge in July, I went there today for lunch to make a run at the "Pounder" Burger (20 oz).I ordered a Pounder with Jalapenos, Pepper Jack Cheese, & Mayo.  I passed on Fries or Onion Rings because I wanted to make sure I had enough room to finish this monster burger.The waitress was very friendly and the service was good.  It didn't take long for my burger to come out.I immediately attacked it and pulled an Adam Richman.....I ate as fast as I could to avoid my stomach getting full.  I was surprised in that I never had to stop....I annihilated the burger in less than 10 min.  Besides the occasional pause to add mustard, I didn't have to catch my breath.  It was easier than I expected.With the challenge completed, the waitress took a picture of me for the wall....there was another customer who completed the challenge in the restaurant, so he got his picture taken as well.The burger itself tasted ok....it wasn't anything great.  Maybe I ate it too fast and didn't get a chance to savor the flavor....I don't know.Will I return?  Yes, to give a regular burger, fries, onion rings, and shake a try.I was able to make the UYE burger challenge after all, but didn't participate in the 1 lb competition.  I was at a BBQ earlier in the day and since I completed the challenge last month, I didn't feel compelled to do it again.So, I decided I would give the Milkshake & Onion Rings a try.  I ordered an Oreo Cheesecake & Peanut Butter Milkshake and a Small order of Onion Rings.  The Milkshake was good, but it was too runny.  I like thick Shakes.  The Onion Rings were very thin and very, very greasy....didn't have much flavor either.....very bland.  Despite ordering the Creamy Jalapeno Sauce to go along with the Onion Rings, it didn't help it much.Overall, I had a good time with fellow Yelpers at the UYE, but the food was eh.Will I return?  Probably not....there are too many burger joints in town and this one is kind of far from my house.As soon as I checked in here I was tempted to go to the edit settings on my Yelp app to correct the spelling. Turns out that's how they wanted it. First off, do not plan on eating here if you have any kind of time restraint. We came on a saturday afternoon at about 12:15. We were expecting it to be packed since it was lunch time but the place was about 40 percent full. So we were thinking we should have enough time to get to our 2 pm appointment. Well, it took about 10 minutes before our server came over to take our order. Since it was our first time, we had some questions to ensure our order was correct.Since they are called Cheeburger Cheeburger, of course we were going to try their namesake. How it works is this. You select what size 100 percent angus beef patty. How you want it cooked (medium, medium well, or well). Pick your bun (honey wheat or kaiser roll). Pick your cheese (9 to choose from). Finally, pick your toppings (26 to choose from including peanut butter). Keep in mind that you can only have 1 of each topping and cheese for free. Any doubling there is an extra charge.So I chose a 1/2 Pound Serious Burger ($7.99) cooked medium with pepper jack cheese on a kaiser roll. For the toppings I chose lettuce. tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, pineapple, roasted red peppers, and chipotle sauce. I also added bacon for 99 cents because it is not one of their free toppings. The taste? It was just decent. The beef patty itself didnt have too much flavor. Im glad the toppings I selected all went together really good flavorwise. I ordered the half pounder because I realized that the price was only for the burger. No sides at all. I should of ordered the next size down because we ended up ordering a fries/onion rings combo to go with it.We got the medium sized Best of Both Basket (4.99) which feeds 2 to 3 people. This combination of fries and onion rings were just ok. The fries themselves were a little bit thicker than McDonalds fries but smaller than steak fries. The onion rings were really good. You can tell it was just freshly battered and deep fried because of the consistency of the crunch it produced. Dont forget you can add free toppings to these sides as well.My wife and older son orderd the 1/3 Pound Semi Serious Burger ($6.99) and chose their options as well.Service is pretty much the main reason why im giving them 3 stars. Everything seemed to take forever from the moment we received the menus. By the time we got the check to pay, it was already 1:30 so we had to leave right away.Some random info:They also have wraps, sandwiches, and salads that the free toppings apply to as well not to mention milkshakes that you can create over 1,258,000 flavor combinations from. Hours are everyday 11 am to 9 pm. They just opened a new location in Anthem (Basically Henderson) off of Eastern and St. Rose Parkway. Their biggest patty is 1 pound (20 oz before cooking). If you finish all of that you get to have your picture taken and put on the wall.Overall, the food here is decent but the really slow service needs some improvement. I can understand you cook everything from scratch since the place was only about 40 percent occupied, imagine having a full house. Then you definitely dont want to have any plans scheduled too close to a dining episode here. Im willing to try them again at a future date.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #195

Je ne comprends pas la rivalité Montréal / NY avec les Bagel. En toute honnêteté j'm'en fou, je trouve que c'est s'obstiné sur des stupidités.  Récemment on avait un débat mon ami et moi sur : Qui fait les meilleurs Bagels entre St-Viateur et Fairmount Bagel. Je dois admettre en toute sincérité ne pas y voir de différences. La majorité des fanatique mange leur bagel avec du fromage à la crème et je dois admettre à mon tour que c'est pas quelque chose que j'aime. J'aime mieux le fromage de chèvre genre le Sabot de Blanchette bien croulant avec une overdose de jambon polonais. Sinon juste du beurre, trop de beurre c'est mieux que pas assez.  Je comprends le monde qui dit que c'est plus dur a manger que ceux de NY parce que c'est moins épais mais c'est surtout là que j'trouve que ça fait son charme, j'aime mes bagels vraiment bien rôti, parce que le côté dur et très cuit c'est mon truc. Le bon côté? C'est frais, pas cher, la majorité des restants de change nous permettre d'aller plus loin et d'avoir des bagels frais. Le vendeur m'a même dit, voyant que j'étais en arrière de la ligne et n'avait plus personne après moi...je vais te donner des bagel chaud si t'attends 1 minutes. Hell yeah! Je veux dire, directement sorti du four. Bon service, courtois et rapide. Cash seulement. C'est pas mal un petit commerce avec 1 fridge qui a du fromage a la crème, du saumon fumé et voia.

Review Text :
The sparkling clean, tile-encrusted brewery of Le Cheval Blanc shown to me by the brewmaster after we had a couple of pints, doesn't produce much (its a six barrel system), but it certainly churns out fine beer to the taps of their dimly lit brewpub, embroidered in deep leather red, accented by steel and wood. Six CAD for a pint of a fine IPA (spiked with citron), well balanced, not too bitter, the citrus backed up by a judicious application of Citra Hops. Six CAD for an Imperial of cream ale; rich, filling, warming. Me and the brewmaster talk in broken French and broken English about our favorite wines and beers, foraging for morels, cooking large dinners for friends. Music plays softly; a back patio waits for the snow to melt. We go outside and smoke a Gauloise cigarette apiece, swearing against the cold (he in French, I in Arabic).  Its a nice moment; we speak of our beer and food, the failures of both of our nations  (Canada apparently sucks as much as the U.S. these days), of the loves and losses and pains of everyday life in a big city.  He wants to move to San Francisco, I want to move to Montreal. We both laugh at the improbability of either happening. I fall in love with the bartender, her boyfriend walks in, they share a lingering kiss. I fall out of love with the bartender.A quick shot of whiskey (on the house), and I have to move out, my ruddy complexion sophomorically optimistic in the face of a cold too profound for a man from San Francisco to comprehend. The bartender gives me a half-wave and a smile, I fall back in love.My mustache freezes in the winter air.

Review Text :
Pulled. Pork. Poutine.Someone back in the kitchen could be curing cancer, but I'm glad their brilliance is focused on food, because this shit is actually one of the best ideas ever. With a touch more of the tangy BBQ sauce, it might even be the best food of all time, but I think at this point it's going to have to settle for being just ONE of the tastiest treats I've ever tasted.The crazy thing about Vices et Versa is that even if they didn't have pulled pork poutine on the menu it would still be an incredible bar, first and foremost because they have beers for DAYS. There are 33 on the tap list (that apparently rotates pretty frequently), and they are all locally brewed and judging by the four or five I was able to taste, all delicious. I guess I'm not well-versed enough in Quebec microbreweries to recall all of them, but I did have one brew called the Peche Mortal (mortal sin) that was dangerously tasty. And there was some kind of fiddle party going on in the back room.I'm moving to Montreal.Ah, Vices et Versa! Tu parles d'un beau gastropub. La liste des bières locales et importées est la meilleure et plus complète en ville et leur menu de pub est vraiment bien pour un endroit qui ne spécialise pas au niveau restauration. Comme tout bon gastropub, ils ont des sandwichs, burgers, frites, poutines, etc. Le service peut parfois être lent, mais c'est seulement le cas lorsque le bar est rempli, ce qui est assez normal... amirght? Mais sérieux, le staff s'y connaît bien au niveau de la classification et des caractéristiques de leur sélection de bières et sont super sympathiques lorsqu'on pose des questions. Et, petit conseil d'ami : prenez conscience de la liste des bières en fût disponibles avant de poser la question de "qu'est-ce que vous avez en fût?" à votre serveur... La liste est vraiment longue et ce n'est pas la question la plus constructive. À la place, demandez dont de savoir qu'est-ce qu'ils ont dans une catégorie spécifique - genre IPA, lambique, ESB, cidres, etc. Ça va vous éviter de partir sur le mauvais pied ;)Finalement, en été, on y va aussi pour la terrasse arrière. Elle est toute belle, avec des belles plantes et des petites vignes. Ça fit bien dans le quartier et c'est un endroit parfait en une soirée chaude d'été avec une bonne 'tite frette à la main! Santé!

I wasn't feeling this at all.  We met up with a couple of friends and one said this was his spot.  My wife likes Cafe Rio a lot too.They're famous for their sweet bbq pork which would've been great..in a barbecue sandwich! The sweetness was too much and really weird in a burrito, even weirder in the salad my wife got.  I would just go with the fire grilled steak or chicken if I could do it all over.I also disliked how they wouldn't put guacamole in the actual burrito itself.  I was given a teeny, weeny scoop of The Incredible Hulk TV series colored avocado on the side.  That was gross.  Mexicant, Mexidont, Mexiwont.A couple of things save Cafe Rio from 1 star and that's the quality of the tortillas and the drink station.  Their fresh tortillas could possibly be the best by a Mexican fast food chain and the biggest reason I may give it another shot.  The drink station is bigger than the usual and includes horchata, limeade and various teas.

So I've been here a half dozen times now (not by choice mind you!) and the 2 star rating still holds. An example of how rude their servers are: I ordered a sushi platter described on the menu as "california roll, and tuna hand roll". I despise spicy tuna (I hate spicy things and hate mayo) so imagine my surprise when a *spicy* tuna handroll shows up. I explain to the waiter the menu says just tuna so I'd like a tuna handroll. He refuses, says I'm wrong, the menu says "spicy" and walks away. I have to freaking go grab a menu , show him the words "tuna hand roll" , and ask again for a new handroll before he goes and grabs me another one. UGHBesides the service, the food is just BLAH. Bland, expensive. I'm into the whole foo-foo lunch thing, but honestly Society Cafe at Encore does the whole concept far better. The surf and turf tacos for $17 are TINY. I got a filet mignon cobb salad today for $18. I order my steak medium rare. The salad is so sad looking and imagine my disappointment to find my "filet mignon" is 2 ounces or so of grizzly, tough, dark brown "steak". Hardly a filet mignon, definitely not medium rare, and for sure 2 ounces of steak over greens for $18 is a ripoff. The sushi is a step above grocery store sushi - yup, that's the best I can say for it. Rant over . Space is still beautiful but service & food continue to go downhill.This is a superb place to have lunch or brunch.  It's not cheap, so don't come in here with that kind of attitude.  It's a place to be seen in Vegas.  I've been here several times over the past few years and I always see a celebrity while dining.  Gawking is not cool, so if you're easily impressed with that kind of stuff, save the jaw dropping and drooling for the casino floor and nightclub.....this is not for rookies.Now, about the food.....it's very, very good.  Some of the dishes I've had over the last few visits:Farm Fresh Omelet (Mushrooms, Bell Peppers, Onions, Cheese, Ham, Spinach, $13)Black Angus Burger ($15)Grilled Cheese Sandwich w/Bacon ($14)Margherita Pizza ($14)The Grilled Cheese is excellent!  My favorite Grilled Cheese Sandwich in Vegas.  The Burger is solid.  When I feel like having breakfast at lunch, I'll go for the Omelet.....it never disappoints.The atmosphere is trendy and the large glass windows facing the pool allow a ton of natural lighting to come in and set a unique mood that you can't find in Vegas very often.Overall, it's one of my favorite places in Vegas.Return Factor - 100%SUNDAY BRUNCH:What a terrific way to spend a beautiful Sunday morning.  This brunch has it all from the character, atmosphere, unique brunch items and service.  I like how they encourage even the customers to come wearing pajamas.  We opted not to but we definitely will next time. To say I went over the top with the food is an understatement.  The fullest I have ever felt in my life and believe me when I say I can be a ridiculously gluttonous pig.  Even my wife who eats with me everyday was taken a back.  I was out of control. I did actually have as small as a dinner the night before in order to be as hungry as I could do get my $40 worth of all you can eat.  We started with the dishes at the self serve area.  There were 6 choices at the panini/sandwich/crepe station and we had 3 of them.  The super friendly and helpful gentleman manning the station suggested his favorite which was a slice of baguette grilled in some kind of honey and butter which was outstanding.  My only thought was that it would taste even better while being inebriated.  The crepes were just ok and could've been a little more toasty than spongy but that's just our preference. The sushi station was way above the average buffet sushi.  All the nigiri and rolls were made to order with the exception of Simon's signature crispy tuna which were amazing.  I had 8 pieces of crispy tuna and 8 pieces of salmon.  They also had a whole slab of smoked salmon layed out and I probably had 5 slices of that.The juice station!  I loved this.  Does any other restaurant offer this as part of the menu?  Please let me know if there is because I would be all over this.  Freshly squeezed fruit, protein shakes, vegetable juices, yogurt smoothies and I could have as many as I wanted to.  Damn, dude!  I must've had 7 glasses of various liquids.  I didn't partake in the extra alcohol deals since I didn't feel like being bombed and then hungover by 4pm.  But the deals were reasonable: $12 for unlimited Black Star beer or $17 for unlimited champagne/mimosa/bellinis or $14(?) for unlimited trips to the make your own bloody mary bar.  I would rather have them make my bloody mary since I would screw it up but it looked quite popular.And on top of all this great stuff there's the a la carte menu.  We had the french toast which I think was encrusted with Frosted Flakes.  It was crunchy, sweet with a soft center.  Genius!  4 different types of hash.  I generally dislike Hollandaise sauce but it was ok with the steak hash.  We also got an additional fill of protein from the egg white frittata which was packed with 5 different veggies including corn, onion and several peppers.  I was unable to finish the frittata due to the fact they must've used about 12 eggs in it.  Breakfast pizza is a must.  So wrong yet so right.  Topped with sausage, bacon, country gravy and other ingredients that make diets run and hide.  I inhaled it like a champion.  You've probably heard of the meat sweats but have you ever heard of breakfast sweats?  That's what I went through about an hour after the meal.  So much good food.  I am definitely going to pace myself better next time and will definitely do less carbs as well but everything looked (and tasted) so damn good!I don't have many regrets in life, but eating brunch at Simon is one of them. It was quite possibly one of the biggest wastes of money I've ever spent at a restaurant. Mediocre food along with mediocre service made for a poor dining experience at a place know for brunch. It's a combination of buffet style, where you get your own food at a buffet line, and butler style, where you place an order with your server and they bring the order to you.The Easter brunch I went to consisted of average paninis, sushi that was the equivalent of that found at the local grocery store, bruschetta, crepes, pastries and cereal.Of the higher-end items served butler style, the french toast with its crispy exterior was the best. Less than stellar items included the lobster havarti benedict that was sorely lacking any lobster. I saw a couple specs of crustacean between the bread base of the benedict. Continuing the disappointment were the dry ribs and even dryer jalapeno cornbread. The kid's pancake was dense and had an almost rubbery texture. Ham and roast beef was also available and as good as any you'd find at a $8.99 buffet downtown. Desserts were lackluster and even someone like me who craves sweets, couldn't stomach more than a couple bites. For the price we paid for a family of three, I couldn't help but think about all the other places -- buffet or a la carte -- that would have been much more satisfying.Simon says SUNDAY BRUNCH! Made a reservation for 6 on Sunday for brunch with some fun people. When I walked in I was walked to the table my friends we already sitting at. The waiter already had water waiting and some limes and lemons on the table, i wish more place would do that. He offer me other drink options but I just stayed with water. After everyone showed up he went through the menu with us. One side was what the buffet offered which included sushi rolls, paninis, bagels, fruit, shrimp, crepes, and smoothies. The other side was from the kitchen which included pizzas, benedicts, and my favorite the white trash. With brunch you pay 39.50 and get to order from either side. We were a little confused at first but figured out we were not being punked. All of food for 39.50, eat it now!!! So, first we orders some items from the kitchen and then go up and cruised the buffet area. I grab some pineapple, muffins, sushi, and bagels. I also ordered a panini. Headed back to the table with almost a full plate. What have I gotten myself into?!?! The sushi was delicious. My favorite was the crispy rice and avocado roll. They also had other option like spicy tuna, California, and shrimp. I also like the blueberry loaf they had out, it was moist and delicious. The panini i ordered was the honeycomb baguette, it was interesting. i think i should have gone with a crepe. After I demolished the buffet stuff our orders from the kitchen started coming out. My first and favorite dish of the day was the chicken fried chicken. Just like chicken fried steak but it was chicken with gravy and an egg on top. The chicken was deliciously seasoned and just enough. My friend ordered a pizza, it was okay. Not something i would come back for. We also ordered waffles, pancakes, french toast and even some egg Benedict with pulled pork. Everything came out pretty quickly. Near the end we ordered some ribs and they were layered with bbq sauce which was awesome. Then we were finishing up and he brought us COTTON CANDY!!! We demolished the first cup and then had him bring more. He brought 3 more and we were then playing with it and make cotton candy mustaches and even dipping it in our drinks. We had too much fun for brunch. So my recommendation are the crispy rice, chicken fried chicken, and cotton candy. Also, my apologies for no good pictures. The food was inhaled.Since Simon is closing soon, I needed to get here and try the famous Sunday brunch when the servers all wear pajamas and the food is abundant.  The brunch is divided into two parts--a regular bar area where you can take an assortment of rolls and other sweets, treats like fruit flavored crispy treats and large peel and eat shrimp from a large tub.  In addition, you can have a panini or crepe made and there are other goodies there, too.  The other choice is to order items off the menu that is part of Sunday brunch.I first got some treats off the regular buffet like spread, basically junk food--well let's say, food with lots of sweetness.  The winner here was the cake pop.  That was quite good.I had several items from the order menu.  The lobster havarti Benedict was great and the Simon French toast made from dipping the brioche into frosted flakes was quite good, too.The winner today though was a small baguette sandwich made with fig jam and bleu cheese.  With the baguette put on the panini maker, the cheese melted and the fig and cheese together was the best thing I had.Service was OK.  I had two different servers.  Coffee was not refilled until I asked and at one point I had three dirty dishes on the side of my two top high table.I'm glad I took the opportunity to go here before  Simon closes.

Review Text :
You know how people go on these awesome quests to discover all the best of certain things, mostly food dishes? For example, finding the best burger, the best pizza or the best taco joint, etc... Well, if you're making that list for Eggs Benedict, I think you may need a pit stop at Restaurant L'avenue in #Montreal.We snuck in before a 30 minute wait and grabbed the last table by the door in this ever so hip, yet a bit small restaurant. With only French menus, I did decipher a few things, but our lovely waitress in a hurry let us know that they are known for their Eggs Benedict. We ordered up 2 sets of Bennies, his with Montreal smoked meat, swiss, mustard and of course hollandaise and mine with mushrooms, garlic aioli, bacon and hollandaise. They arrived about 15 minutes or so later. Cold. Boo, but silver lining is that they were still some of the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had.That hollandaise sauce was superb. So light and airy, with hints of lemon, but oh so rich and creamy with the perfect consistency. The flavor combo of the mushrooms, bacon and garlic confit was heavenly and oh so different in the best way possible from the rich and salty bites of smoked meat covered in dripping yolk. If it was a tad bit warmer, the dish would have been unquestionably one of the best things I've eaten in a while. If this wasn't enough, the dishes were accompanied with perfectly seasoned breakfast potatoes and a skewer of delicious fresh fruit. I was stuffed to the gills by the end of this proper brunch and although Eggs Benedict are quite gluttonous, I didn't feel too heavy or guilty.So this leads me to why this review was not five stars. Our service lacked a bit, hence cold food. Not sure if this is a regular thing here, but they were severely understaffed. Granted it was a Monday at 11am and they were slammed, but with only 2 servers for the 50 people seated, I'd imagine that was why our food was cold. Another negative was that the coffee sucked, comparable to dirty diner coffee with the creamer packets on the side.The other dishes being served look magnificent and in a foodie city like Montreal, when there's a savage line on a Monday late morning, you know whatever they're serving must be good. Bonus: One of the coolest, if not THE coolest bathrooms ever. Worth the trip even if you don't have to pee.Oh good gracious THIS is the breakfast emporium! The breakfast menu is simply dizzying. There are so many variations of egg based dishes (regular or Omega 3 ), Eggs Benedict, Omelettes, Montreal Bagels, American Style Fluffy Pancakes, and Exotic Juices to choose from that my eyes were bulging out while attempting to make my mind on what to order. Thank goodness, on Saturdays, breakfast is served from 8am till 4pm.If you come during the week, you can also enjoy salads, sandwiches, poutines, hamburgers, milkshakes, martinis, steak, stews, curry, other pub fare!For over 20 years, l'Avenue is best known for their Eggs Benedict of which favorites are the Chorizo, Steak and Eggs or the 'Tout l'Monde à Poële' variations. I went for the third option. Wow, the two gigantic portions were just sitting in front of me waiting to be devoured. The eggs were perfectly poached, oozing with golden yolk as you dug your way in, beautifully dressed with sautéed Champignons de Paris, Pleurotes, Portobello mushrooms and lusciously coated with creamy hollandaise sauce. The eclectic atmosphere and excellent service from a dynamic team of smiling waiters, especially Jezabel, who was so patient with me most definitely adds stars to the experience. Kudos to owner Johnny Di Tomasso, a meticulous planner and team builder! Will I return to try the Chorizo at L'Avenue? I sure will and so should you. Just one note... this is not a 'cheapy eats' destination so it'll be a bit heavy on your wallet but you do get what you pay for.Now here's a happy accident! A popular place in the area was closed for brunch only for us to find out at the restaurant doorstep. Major bummer, right? We scrambled around for a decent place and were led to L'Avenue. A line was forming out the door so we too, had to fall in. Half an hour later of standing out in the cold, a table opens up for two. Booyah! We walked in to a warm and vibrant atmosphere of brunchers and their libations in hand. It was the weekend after all! My friend and I were more than happy to join in the fun. The place was packed, loud, and colorful! It felt like one big party was going on inside and I loved every bit of the vibe in the room. Our server was very French and so was the menu. No English menu available. Sure I could read some of the ingredients but who was I kidding?! I was starving and had no intention on doing a refresher of culinary French terms. Our very kind and quick server explained the menu to us so graciously and led us to order two kinds of eggs benedict that we will remember for quite some time...STEAK and EGGS. Wow! It was a beautiful plate full of promise. One bite and I was in heaven. Meat was tender and amazingly flavorful. The hollandaise sauce was fantastic. The egg, ohhh the egg! I cut into it and it was oozing with yellow silky yolk all over my plate. What a sight that was to behold. EGGS BENEDICT on FRENCH TOAST. Ahhhmazing! The perfect combination of sweet and savory in every spoonful. The toast was fluffy with a nice touch of "coconutty" sweetness while the ham, egg, and sauce had enough brine to let each ingredient shine. Yeah, that rhymed! Can't decide which one I like better but these two Bennies are without a doubt the best I've had, just yet.Servings are quite large but they're so good you'll end up finishing it anyway. My friend and I had one of each since an order comes with two pieces. Perfect sharing item, indeed. Both came with delicious rosemary seasoned potatoes and fresh fruits on the side. How complete can that brunch be? On that note, let's not forget how fantastic their mimosas were. Freshly squeezed OJ with some pulp and the right ratio of champagne to juice. Cheers! To wait out in the cold was a pain but I would have done it all over again on this same trip if only time was our friend in this city. I highly recommend!Oh. My. God. Yum. I went here on a Thursday for brunch with a friend and the reviews were right, this place is amazing. The waiter explained how they really put an emphasis on ensuring the best quality food, and this showed when we got our food. I arrived before my friend and was worried I would have to wait for her before I could get seated (there was only one couple in front of me when I arrived) but I asked the waiter and he said I didn't have to wait and seated me right by the window. He was very friendly and helpful. I had the French toast with bananas caramelized in captain Morgan rum, with Nutella and a sauce (which a believe had rum also) with real pieces of coconut on top. The flavors went so well together and weren't overly sweet tasting. The portion size was big, I wasn't able to finish my plate. I was surprised this place was even able to accommodate my friend who has so many restrictions (doesn't eat gluten, vegetarian, and lactose intolerant). She ordered the eggs Benedict with all vegetables, substituted the English muffins for portobello mushrooms ($2 charge) and swapped out her potatoes for a salad ($1 charge). I had read someone's review saying the bathrooms will give you nightmares, so of course I had to check them out, and they're awesome. There was a lot of water on the floor though :/ I will definitely be back here. I'd suggest going on a weekday before 11am to avoid a huge lineup.Best breakfast food ever.Omelets , panacakes, there were 4 of us and we couldnt even get up to leave.

Review Text :
I felt like I need to provide a current Andrew Blair's review because a lot of these are outdated. Gone are the days of the packed house, dress code and club scene. They've attempted to rebrand with a new countrified logo and feel.  I am personally not a fan of the new AB logo with the wheat behind it but I appreciate their effort to have a more "comfortable" neighborhood feel. I saw several people in tshirts, shorts, jeans and sunglasses. Maybe it was the NRA in town but I even spotted some decidedly "red" folks.  So maybe it is like a country club, but in Gastonia. :)Their decor hasn't changed, so it still feels like a nice place, but definitely softer and more comfortable than say a Liberty gastropub. Opt for outdoor seating if the weather cooperates. Even on a hot night the fans keep the air moving and it was nice. They had a sangria special- it tastes fine enough but lacks the fun fruit you can munch on like at Sole, so I'd skip it for their nice wines.We had the meatloaf with mac and cheese and green beans. I really enjoyed the green beans- they were cooked perfectly and still retained a little snap to them. The meatloaf was also very nice.  We also had the filet mignon.  They had one misfire on temperature, but their make good efforts were overwhelming- best I've seen of any restaurant.  The remake of the steak was cooked perfectly, they replated it with new sides. The manager was very concerned about our happiness and took a lot of time talking with us.  She also invited us to their new brunch on Sundays. They apparently have a creme brulee french toast that looks divine. I wonder if it can compare with 131 Main's granola french toast?  But I digress. The portions were not large enough for my hungry man so we ordered a side of mushrooms which were nicely seasoned with shallots and scallions. We were offered two chocolate bourbon truffles at the end of the night which were lovely- not too sweet, and solid texture. We opted out of dessert (a shock to both of us, I know). I would like to go back for their Pinot Thursdays where they do Pinot Noir tastings on the 3rd Thursday of every month. Final tip: Citipass coupon book has a buy one get one free. So all in our meal cost $40 including a generous tip. So given that, the value was great.

Restaurant name  Cafe La Bellitalia

Review Text :
We are really fortunate to have this little gem on Madison's lovely Northside. They remodeled the former Ole'N Rick's Northside Inn (or Rick'N Ole's, depending on which side of the sign you read) after the smoking ban was implemented in Madison in July 2005 (5 years before the statewide ban). Many critics thought bars and restaurants would not survive without their smoking patrons. Ole'N Rick's owners retired and sold their quaint space early during the smoking ban implementation. It turns out, a little Italian joint is exactly what the Northside needed, and Cafe La Bellitalia has been building their business here for the last 9 years.We ordered takeout, and here is the lowdown:They have great pizza, with LOADS of toppings. There's no skimpy pizza found here! We ordered an XL of The Works pizza. It was huge and tasted great! One thing we have noticed during our 13 years in Madison is that there isn't a lot of really good pizza in this town. Bellitalia is a list-topper for us. Pro tip: they sell slices over lunch on weekdays.I was in the mood for pasta and ordered the homemade fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. It comes with a "side" of garlic bread, which is essentially a small loaf of Italian bread. I immediately devoured this garlic butter goodness (I rode my bike 65 miles today, so I can eat whatever I want, right?). The pasta was delicious with it's perfectly creamy sauce and they didn't hold back at all on the chicken. The portion was HUGE in the take-out container, definitely enough for two people.We've had great experiences, both dining in and with take-out. There's always a good crowd and they seem to be doing a great business. They've certainly been a great addition to the Northside community.

The food here is delicious, carefully crafted, beautifully presented, paired well with wines...it was a great dining experience overall.  The restaurant was recommended by our Canadian host.  The staff was extremely nice and helpful, and our waiter suggested a salmon appetizer and veal sweetbread entree.  The sweetbread was one of the best dishes I've ever eaten.  I can't say enough positives about the dining experience here.  Highly recommended.

Restaurant name  Luke's Of Chicago
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
A co-worker of mine is often nostalgic for his Chicago days, and says that Luke's is the closest thing he has found to a Chicago-style hot dog in AZ.  So, on this gorgeous sunny day (how can you miss Chicago on a day like today!?) off we went to satisfy a craving for some Chi-Town goodness.If you can survive the parking lot rodeo that is the shopping area where Luke's is located, you are in for a treat.  Italian sandwiches, subs, burgers and of course, hot dogs.  This place is popular!  The space is small and the line to order can stretch out the door, so get there early if you want a table at lunchtime.I went with "The Original" - a pure beef hot dog with mustard, relish, pickle, and tomato in a poppy seed bun.  It is usually served with onions and peppers as well, but I like to make fresh breath a priority and decided against those.  I don't think there was any room left in the bun, anyway.  My friend had the Maxwell Street - a Polish sausage with onions, peppers and mustard.  It looked pretty tempting, too.  Both came with a side of crinkle-cut fries, which I upgraded to cheese fries in order to get a heart-stopping vat of cheese sauce for dipping.  I am not ashamed to admit that I ended up dipping the hot dog in there too.  So bad, but so good!I am now going to curl up under my desk and take a nap.I was brought here by two friends who live in Illinois, though not exactly in Chicago proper, who have been gushing about how good Luke's of Chicago's iIalian beef sandwiches for YEARS!  Now ever city has something it's known for: Boston has its baked beans, New York has its pizza, Hawaii has anything with pineapple or coconut on it, and Philadelphia has its cheesesteak sandwich.  Chicago has been lucky enough to have two specialty food items it's well known for - pizza and italian beef sandwiches - which must be why they were generous enough to share one of them with the Scottsdale/Phoenix area. According to my friends,  Luke's of Chicago was a family owned chain back in Chicago and one of the family members moved out to the Phoenix and that's why this one exists.  Now, I'm writing this review from (Davis) Illinois, but that certainly doesn't make me an authority on what makes for the best Italian beef sandwiches having very little basis for comparison.  What I DO know is that the sandwich I was served last Monday at this particular location of Luke's of Chicago - an Italian beef sandwich, baptized (dunked or doused in warm meet juices) and layered with sweet peppers and cheese was PRETTY FREAKIN' AMAZING.  I'm serious, this was a freakishly good sandwich, worth doing a little extra driving for.  My friends assure me that this is the best Italian sandwich I'll ever taste, and I may do a little comparison shopping while I'm in Illinois to figure out if that is indeed true or not.We also ordered some regular french fries and garlic parmesan fries to share and I admit I am also a fan. It was 114 F in Phoenix the day we came here, not a day you'd normally be looking to eat something hot, but that didn't dissuade us since we were on a mission.  I come out to Phoenix once a year from California but this was my first experience at Luke's, my friends went without me last year - still not sure I've forgiven them for that.

Restaurant name  Zaba's Mexican Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Zaba's Mexican Grill is a small chain of  convenient Americanized Mexican fast food eateries, all located in the Las Vegas area. There are about 5 -6 of them now.Zaba's is like Chipotle, but browner. No, not browner as in darker Mexicans, ones with more indian blood than Spanish blood. Not at all. Browner because instead of white floured tortillas or white rice, they offer healthier brown. Zaba's concept is very similar to Chipotle, even the line and service process at the counter is similar. But Zaba's offers more variety. Such as brown rice, wheat tortillas, or fish and shrimp tacos or burritos. They also have a more colorful decor than the tin can aluminum decor of Chipotle. This one is also larger than most Chipotles, with booths and tables and about 2 to3 times the seating capacity.I came here to order lunch for a group I was visiting in a nearby office, a lunch and learn session. They had faxed the order in, but the manager was so anal, he couldn't fill the order unless they used their official fax order form! WTF? He faxed back the official form and said he called. Meanwhile, I had talked to him several times about the order, and he didn't tell me this. So I had to call the office, confirm the order, and told him to fill in the blanks that weren't on the order. He had difficulty with this, being a bit OCD or something.We finally got the order put together and delivered the food. It is pretty tasty, even when it is browner.

Restaurant name  Samba Brazilian Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I know this may be surprising to some, but I think Samba is the best Brazilian Steakhouse I have ever been to. To this date I have now been to some in Chicago, in Kansas, and in Madison and Madison wins hands down! I love that when they built this place they put a more casual restaurant downstairs and you have to go upstairs to enter the Brazilian Steakhouse. The outside is always decorated in lights and really creates the right mood before you even enter the building. I have been there 4 different times since it has opened and every time it is amazing. It is cheaper than the ones found in Chicago as well as in Kansas and personally has much better food. As soon as you walk in you are greeted by very friendly hostess who always offer to hang up your coats. Each time I have had a reservation I have always been promptly seated. The waiters are pretty quick to come up and offer drinks and explain how the concept of a Brazilian Steakhouse works. Their drink menu is rather large and each time I try a new one it is fantastic! I love going up to their salad bar area where they have an array of items including obviously salad items, vegetables, mashed potatoes (yum!), bread and so much more. Once you have eaten your "appetizers" you flip over your coaster to the green side so the men in gauchos know to come around and offer you different cuts of meat. So many of them are good, I always start by trying almost all of them and then once I have decided my favorites of the night I normally have seconds of those specific kinds. I also love that most of the nights I have gone (I think 3 out of the 4) they had live bands playing. It fit right into the atmosphere and creates such a nice night every time. The music is never to loud or obnoxious, it is rather enjoyable to get a table near the stage and listen to some great music as you enjoy a fantastic meal. You really can not go wrong at such a great place. The main things to remember about this great place: 1. They have a large selection of original drinks and a large wine menu 2. The meat is delicious 3. Relatively inexpensive for a Brazilian Steakhouse Enjoy!I have never been to a Brazilian steak house before. This was quite an experience. For those of you who don't know what goes down at these places, let me enlighten you. Basically, people with two foot meat-on-a-stick come to your table and cut the meat right off the slab for you. To me, it seemed a little barbaric and kinda gross. I couldn't get myself to eat much of the different meats they had. However, they had this awesome roasted (?) pineapple on a stick that was so flavorful, it knocked my socks off. I mean, it was REALLY good. They also had a impressive salad bar. The salad bar has every salad ingredient you've never heard of. So, for me anyway, since I didn't know what 80% of the ingredients were, I ended up with a pretty pathetic salad. They also had warm sides which included some pretty bitchin mashed potatoes.  Meh, I don't think I'll ever come here again. I'm glad I tried it though.

Restaurant name  Geisha House Steak & Sushi
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Every so often I yearn for Japanese steakhouse fare.  On one such recent night Diane and I traveled to Geisha House to take care of that craving.  And, we were not disappointed.  The Miso Soup with sliced White Mushrooms and green onion circles floating in a consomme-like broth was hot and heartening.  A circular presentation of a Rainbow Roll was fairly good as a starter, and was refreshingly cold sushi to act as a counterpoint to the hot soup that preceded it.  This was followed by a nice salad with Iceberg Lettuce, a slice of tomato, carrot slivers, and cucumbers with a tasty Ginger Dressing.A trademark of Geisha House is its pink-colored, spiced up Fried Rice, with carrots, onion, and egg.  Valentine's Day was just around the corner, but I still considered the pink-buttered rice to be gimmicky and would have been glad to do without it.  However, I appreciate that, besides including both soup and salad, this restaurant serves Fried Rice as part of its meals to all guests, without tacking on an extra charge.  I have found this to be uncommon for Teppenyaki establishments.Next served were generous spatula heapings of grilled zucchini, sprouts, mushrooms and white onions, along with a few grilled shrimps.  To supplement these edibles, along with our orders of Filet Mignon Diane and I split a side of shrimp, which gleaned about 8 more big shrimps apiece for $16.50.  Prices are somewhat steep here, but you get high quality ingredients, and an abundance of food.  At $26.95 a steak, our cut up morsels of Filet were cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered off a nice slab of meat that looked to be about 7 ounces in size.  Accompanying sauces included a very strong, mustard-based Meat Sauce, and a nice mild Shrimp Sauce.  The atmosphere here is boisterous, with rockin' music blaring overhead, and a party atmosphere.  Fellow diners were congenial and in a good mood, and a young crowd congregated at the large bar.  The place always seems to be busy, with many celebrating special occasions.  Birthday balloons commonly abound.  So, rather than being potentially disappointed, I recommend making a reservation in advance like I generally do.  Busy as the restaurant was while we were there on this last occasion, service was excellent and efficient.  Refills of hot tea, Sprite, and water were supplied without having to make requests.  Our grillmaster was proficient at his craft, and displayed some nice tricks accompanied by good humor.  I don't know whether he deserves credit for this or not, but when he set fire to a volcanic onion, the flame jumped up and formed the shape of a dragon's head, which by pure luck I was able to  capture on my digital camera's memory card (see pic).  It is the Chinese Year of the Dragon, after all!  Wait, this is a Japanese restaurant!  Nevertheless, it was a cool moment in the midst of a very pleasurable meal.When I received my check, the Rainbow Roll had been inadvertently left off.  I told my server, and it was added to the bill, with thanks for pointing out the omission.A solid 4 stars!Let me just say that if it weren't for an impromptu invitation to come here and join a b-day party, I would've never set foot here again. I ate here at the sushi bar about 3 or 4 years ago and was not impressed at all. I decided at that time that I would just go elsewhere for sushi when I needed my fix.Tonight, I decided to open up to this place again and try habachi since I was invited to join a party of 9 other folks celebrating a birthday. I was pretty happy to see that the Geisha Special offered everything I needed in one order: shrimp tempura, soup, salad, fried rice, veggies, chicken, filet mignon, lobster and a choice of drink--all for $35. The chef was entertaining and had a great rapport with us rowdy patrons. The atmosphere of the whole place is just so fun and relaxed. It made a huge impact on the dining experience. The table next to us was not as rowdy since half of them were kids. I can see that the chefs here definitely play off of the crowd they're working with. (We were all adults and there was some maturely suggested things going on during the live cooking demonstration, tehe.)Not only was it very entertaining to watch being cooked, the food tasted excellent as well. They have this pink "secret sauce" that they put on everything and tastes phenomenal. I don't think I've had shrimp or lobster more tasty than what they serve here. I tried to con the chef into telling him I needed to know what was in the secret sauce because I may be allergic to an ingredient, but he didn't fall for it since my poker face was much harder to keep after having a few saki bombs.Overall, great service and an awesome dining experience that I won't soon forget. And to think I had been missing out this whole time before giving this place a second try. I can't wait to gather a group of folks to have dinner here again soon.

I should have walked out right after I walked in.  My gut was telling me to leave, but I didn't.... I stuck it out.  Big mistake.We were the only ones in there at 1pm on a Saturday.. bad sign #1.  I ordered the 1lb of boiled shrimp, "Original" style with rice.  I didn't realize "Original" meant "no flavor and way overcooked".  They were so overcooked they were hard to peel and were served with a chipotle mayonnaise!!  Gross!  The rice was literally Asian rice, with a sprinkle of  "cajun seasoning" on top that tasted exactly like a bowl  of white Asian rice.My partner had a Jambalaya thing, thickened with corn-starch and had overcooked shrimps as well.  I would highly recommend avoiding this place.When you pull up outside of the Cajun Seafood Corner, you feel like you are about to enter the Cajun Playtime Corner - the storefront certainly does nothing to reveal the beguiling bayou dishes inside.The decor is reminiscent of any number of Cajun eateries found in New Orleans: Mardi Gras beads and masks hung lovingly on anything stationary, remnants of an old pier, plastic seagulls, fishing nets, and many colorful beer and liquor ads.But you didn't come here for the ambiance, you came her for Cajun!Begin your sensory journey into the swamps with any one of the Bayou Teasers such as the Cajun alligator or Cajun frog legs.  (one tastes like fish, one tastes like chicken)  The appetizers start at $4.95 for Fried Okra and go up to $11.95 for a dozen oysters.Chomp into some Poboys such as the sauteed alligator served wth tomatoe, lettuce, pickle, onion, and their house Cajun sauce.  These come with a delicous basket of Cajun Fries wwhich are hot, fluffy, crispy, and dusted with Cajun spices - amazing with their house aioli.House specialties include Cajun shrimp, Crawfish boil when in season, étouffée, Cajun pasta, seafood jambalaya, gumbo, and blackened catfish. Prices start at $8.95 and go up to $45.95 for the five pounds of crawfish boiled, cooked with andouille, corn, and potatoes.The Seafood gumbo is worth the visit, and was truly transcendent. Hearty, cajuned, and packed with plump shrimp, mussels, scallops, chicken, andouille, okra, and rice - it brought me back to the bayou.The crawfish etouffee was also notable, with a rich creamy cajun sauce packed with plump and juicy crawfish - not to mention the portion was very generous for the $8.85 price.Live crawfish are used here when in season, and the time is now!Daily happy hour is from 2-7p, Happy hour appetizers start at $3.95, Domestic beers at $1.75, and drinks at $3.00.I've been craving a shrimp PoBoy since I left Louisiana, the land of tasty PoBoy's. I drove by this place and flipped a bitch so that I could check it out for lunch. It looks a little uninviting from the outside. I was very surprised to find a quaint little bar and seating area. I thought it was going to be more of a take out place and I almost turned around and walked out because I had my puppy in the car and didn't plan on leaving him. But the woman behind the bar was very inviting and told me she could have my poboy out in five minutes. I told her I'd be in the car with my dog but I'd come back in a couple minutes to get my order. Sure enough, five minute later she comes walking out with my order. I thought it was really great customer service to bring it out to my car for me. The poboy was satisfactory. The breading on the shrimp was too thick and the shrimp was lost in there, everything else about the sandwich was great, especially the roll. The fries were fat, long and perfectly seasoned, all fries should be made like this. I will be back for some Étouffée and this time leave the dog at home so I can enjoy a cold one at the bar.

Located inside the Hyatt Gainey Ranch hotel, The Better Half and I stumbled across this place one night.  It was a pleasant surprise.  There were so many things on the menu that caught our eye.  We decided to go with:Three different types of Bruschetta:- Arrabiata (Spicy Tomatoes, Olives & Garlic), $4- Peperonata (Roasted Peppers, Capers & Basil), $4http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=TmZ6hTHPUtcTFDIs3QR3oQ#TmZ6hTHPUtcTFDIs3QR3oQ- Fagioli (Cannellini Beans, Crispy Prosciutto), $4http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=bYJOjgNiWW6yeWXsy_IXaQ#bYJOjgNiWW6yeWXsy_IXaQEntrees:Fettuccine alla Bolognese (Fettuccine w/Veal and Pork Shank Ragout), $22http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=wvuSD4YdYIc5r_eENfRE8Q#wvuSD4YdYIc5r_eENfRE8QAnatra in Agro-Dolce (Duck Breast, Roasted Baby Vegetableswith Sweet & Sour Roasted Duck Leg, Pine Nuts Sultanas and a Honey Herb Sauce), $27http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=vYEXJIcrxfCh4-cgl5AJlg#vYEXJIcrxfCh4-cgl5AJlgSide DishRisotto w/Parmesan Cheese & Parsley, $7http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=LHXaImmzdoKPh0qcB9Td5Q#LHXaImmzdoKPh0qcB9Td5QDessertCreme Bruleehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=pDHJTf0_B-ToAMq8VCuXFA#pDHJTf0_B-ToAMq8VCuXFAIt sounds like a lot of food, but it wasn't too bad.  The portions are not over the top huge.  Out of the 3 Bruschettas we tried, my favorite was the Fagioli.  It was totally different than anything I've tried before.  The Beans went very well with the Prosciutto and Bread.The Fettuccine all Bolognese was awesome....very rich though.  The Veal & Pork Shank Ragout was what made it rich and full of flavor.  I had a bite of The Better Half's Anatra and it was good too.  The side of Risotto went perfectly with our meal.I was only able to get a small bite out of TBH's Creme Brulee....she doesn't like to share her Dessert, ha!  It was delish....next time, we'll order less Bruschetta so I can get one for myself.Service was outstanding during the entire meal.Return Factor - 85%

Review Text :
Had dinner here my first night in town with my mom, step father and my grandmother. Upon walking in,I knew we were venturing into an upscale type of steak house-not quite the dark boothed feel of old school and not quite a Ruth Chris atmosphere. We were seated in a booth, our waitress was very nice and very young. She advised us of two specials-one a veal chop and one a fish of sorts. My grandmother has been known to love veal chops and we all strongly encouraged her to order one. The rest of the menu was inviting and this is also the type of restaurant where all the sides are a la carte. I ordered the rib eye medium rare and grandma and I decided to share a caesar salad and a baked potato. Mom ordered a salad, step dad ordered prime rib and a potato as well. Our salad arrived as well as bread. The first thing I was shocked with is that instead of spitting the salad for us in the kitchen, the brought the salad and an another plate. First of all, in this type of establishment, for these types of prices, and considering the economy,  I was a bit put off but was able to let it go. Our meals arrived on very hot plates. The veal chop was gorgeous-and grandma dove right in. My rib eye was also gorgeous and huge (should have been for $27+), but it was finished off with butter (something I don't like especially without a gallbladder) and had a spicy rub on it. I took two small bites and was overwhelmed by the spicy flavor (something again I hate with a supposed good cut of meat um, hello Outback). The prime rib was good (or so I was told) and when the waitress came back(this took a long time as well), I told her that the menu did not state the meat was seasoned nor finished off with butter. She acknowledged I was correct and asked if I would like another steak. At this point, I was done (I get like this when I get mad at food) and said no. She was apologetic and grandma kept on loving the veal chop. I was eating the potato grandma and I were splitting and the owner/chef came to our table and apologized for the steak. I said it was fine, he said he would take it off the bill (DUH) and then I said to him it was probably a good idea to train the waitstaff to advise how the steaks are prepared with spice rub and finished off with butter. He then told me they ARE trained to do this and that our waitress did advise him that she forgot to mention this to us/me. Oh well.I like the fact this place is not a chain restaurant. I like that my grandmother enjoyed her meal so much. I didn't like the lack of service for the price nor my meal, so I will have to say this place will not be on my "must visit" list the next time or any time I am in town.Good Steak, Bad Business!My husband, our son (aged 7) and I went to Arrowhead Grill to celebrate my hubby's 42nd birthday. Upon arrival, we were immediately seated, waitstaff was nice, everything went well till the steaks came out.We had already had some decent raw oysters, and some ok-not-great- bread. My $43 DelMonico ("our specialty of the house"!) was so tough I had to send it back. The waiter was appropriately apologetic and brought it back; made me a hew one, but it wasn't done till my family was almost done with the rest of dinner, and I was about full of the a la carte side dishes anyway by that time.(of them, the creamed spinach was VERY good, and the cheesy scallopped potatoes too cheesy and not creamy at all. More like smothered potatoes.)The manager came over and partially apologized, made sure the new one was good, and told me "The second steak is on us." Like I even got to EAT the first one, OR the second one, since it came out 15 mins after I sent the other back!! For a family of three who had spent $236, they charged me for BOTH Delmonico steaks and then took ONE off. BAD BUSINESS! The ENTIRE steak should have been removed from the bill, consistent with policy at other eateries of this caliber. It was not very flavorful but was more tender, but I only ate about 4 bites before I was too full to eat anymore. Plus, now I was annoyed. In this economy, people are more choosy about where to spend their hard-earned money. Why drive people away with an asinine practice like that??When I complained about the policy, the manager kind of shrugged and said, more or less, it is what it is. He actually smirked. It was very car-salesman-like. (Sorry, car salesmen.)We will be taking our next $200 meal-eating selves to Ruth's Chris from now on. VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.On an up note, my husband said HIS filet mignon was one of the best he ever had, AND I have to admit the $7 tableside s'mores are well worth the time and the mere $7 if you have a kid who likes to roast marshmallows and get sticky. The marshmallows were homemade bug square ones cut into four pieces, you get to melt those over a little flame and dip into melted Hershey's chocolate and eat on a graham cracker. That was the best part of the meal for some of us!!But seriously folks, there's a reason Arrowhead can't play with the big guys...they don't treat their customers like the big guys do. Even though we live nearby, we will make the drive to a better place, where we are bound to get the steak done right the first time; AND get treated right when things go wrong so there will BE a next time.When Arrowhead Grill came up as next on my list of places to review, the first thought that crossed my mind was "I need to give this place another shot". So, here is my first impression of Arrowhead Grill: Great place if they STEP UP the service. I visited AG with a friend during restaurant week. The restaurant had just opened up and servers were still setting up here and there. We were seated immediately and we waited to be greeted...and waited. Finally, our waiter made his way over to our table. Here's my thing, when you open your doors for business, you should be ready for business, ready for customers. You could tell he was unprepared to help us out. What about the food? Fantastic. I thought the food was great! I started with Hog Island Kumamoto Oysters. They were small, fresh, and sweet oysters. No funky smell or taste, totally fresh and delightful. For my entree I had the 10 oz Delmonico Steak, rare of course! What a great slab of beef! I sent my compliments to the chef. The steak was cooked beautifully and seasoned perfectly. On the side, I had the Yukon gold mashed potatoes which were delicious! I was full of meat and potato goodness but we had dessert coming! I chose the creme brulee which was perfect consistency and finished table side which was a nice touch! So in between courses, our waiter would vanish. The restaurant wasn't packed at all,so I can only guess he was still doing set up work, but that left my drink empty on too many occasions and me needing a set of silverware. I was annoyed, unfortunately.I will certainly give Arrowhead Grill another shot. The food was very good. Hopefully the quality of service will match the food on my next visit!Sorry this place really sucked . it was expensive and not worth the money YOU CAN COOK BETTER even if you can't cook..I have no idea why people like and recommend this place . anything cheese is from what I had is in a fake cheese sauce . Very orange even more so than Velveeta . The side vegetable (was asparagus ) was cooked till it fell apart and with less skill than the local 2 Star Asian Buffet. disappointed more so than most placesAs only a VERY SLIGHT update 1/22/14Since my review I haven't been back so I can't update my review but my husband ate here twice. He said the steaks he had were OK. He didn't have vegetables either visit but did have the Green Chile Macaroni and Cheese and said it was very improved from what we had when we were there. I asked him how he'd rate his meals and he said around three stars because it was OK. Most likely I won't return anyway.Came here for Mother's day per friends recommendation. My mom and i both ordered the Delmonico steak. My steak came out fine but my mom's steak was TOO salty. We sent it back and the 2nd steak came out with no flavor. Service was very poor and the restaurant wasn't even busy. We had to ask the waitress to refill our bread and she forgot twice. Manager knew the problem and didn't even stop to talk to us. Worst part is the manager walked away to avoid us as we tried to approach him. For the price we paid for the food we expected better service. Will not go back.Buyer beware.  Took advantage of the New Years special this evening, (buy one Delmonico steak between 9-10pm and get the second one for free).  Upon explaining to our waiter that we wanted to take advantage of their "advertised special" in the AZ Central dining deals from AZ Republic that had been advertised since December 21st on this website,we were informed he was not aware of such special.  Upon which my date and I felt totally embarrassed as I didn't want to look like I was just trying to get something for nothing.  He checked with his manager and said "they would honor it", a $28.99 value, but that it was the AZ central error.  From that point on our waiter was very short with us and made us feel like we're putting him out because he wasn't going to make as much in tips from us.  This couldn't be further from the truth, as all items were alacarte and with wine it actually came out to more than if we had ordered steaks alone.  The steaks by the way were excellent, but the tone for the evening with the poor service didn't make up for the taste and presentation of the food.  By the way, we overheard the couple in the booth behind us request the same special, but by that time the restaurant was aware that people would be comming in for the special.Finally to make matters worse, when we got bill for the two of us it had an automatic gratuity of 20% added to the bill.  When I explained to the waiter that this must be a mistake he explained that it was "their policy" to add on this automatic charge whenever they have to "give away food".  When I explained that I didn't feel comfortable in paying such a high mandatory amount, he immediately said he would get the manager and stormed off in a huff.Manager Eric S. came over and supported his waiter by basically backing him up and not listening to our valid complaints.  He actually stormed off also when we told him we wanted to have him adjust the gratuity to what was a more fair assessment of service at 10-15%.  He came back and gave a half hearted apology for "feeling threatened" when I told him I would let others know of their lousy customer service. So there you have it, It appears that their is an attitude at the Arrowhead grill is greater than though, and how dare we to complain.  Needless to say we will not ever be back though the food was good,not worth the hassle and a terrible New Years Eve meal ruined by their ineffective ability to act professional and with grace and understanding.well.......I was taken here last night for my birthday dinner at the suggestion of a friend.  We were going to dine at The Keg because my request was Filet Mignon and King Crab Legs.  This place.....oy!  we had a 7:15 reservation.  had to wait for a few minutes to be seated....not a big deal.  we were sat and began to look at the menu.  PRICEY!  which is fine for us usually.  Asked our waitress Brittany if they had Filet and crablegs.....I was told that i had to order TWO plates.....one for steak and then another whole plate of crab legs.......huh?  12oz filet was $34 and 16oz crab legs plate was $46.........AND.......ALL of the entrees come with NO sides at all.....you have to order your sides seperately....another $8-$14 just for a side. WHAT?  no salad before....no nothing.  they brought bread out to the table....but they were breadsticks and they don't even give you enough for everyone at your table to have a whole one to themselves. put in our order......food arrived........40 minutes later?  are you kidding me?  yes,,,,,there was a well done steak in the mix......but that should have taken 20 minutes.  at the most!  our foodserver Brittany was EXTREMELY scarce!  extremelely!!!  the steak....when it finally came out.....was very good and fresh.....i will say that.......but the fries we ordered for my son.....came out cold.  sent them back......still room temperature.  and they tasted like they were fried in old grease. eh.  It was birthday and i didn't want to make the table of my guests feel uncomfortable by complaining.  so i zipped it. THEN.  I was told they would be bringing out a special dessert with a candle for my birthday.  okay.....cool.  brought out this big plate with a delicious dessert on it and a roman candle to blow out.  i think it was the butter cake....which was absolutely delicious.  FINALLY......after flagging down the "too busy to give us the great service we thought we were paying for" Brittany.......we got the bill.  We had 6 ppl in our party.  two of the people split a steak.....my husband, son, and i split two filets....one 8 oz and one 12oz and a 16oz king crab leg......we had the french fry trio to split....lyonnaise potatoes.....and the lampchop fondue. our bill came to over $250.  How?  they charged us twice for the french fries that we sent back.......the sharing of the over priced meals....AND.......THE BIRTHDAY DESSERT????  they charged me for the birhtday dessert that THEY chose for me?  had i known that I would have liked to try something else on their dessert menu.  THEY CHARGED ME FOR A DESSERT I DIDN"T EVEN GET TO PICK OUT.  I am in total disbelief of this place.  Don't go there.  we are by no means "cheap" people.  but like anyone else....don't like to go somewhere that we feel we were robbed and cheated out of a great dining experience. DO NOT EAT HERE.  you are better off paying the same amount of money.......getting great service..........and not feeling like you're robbed and any other reputable steak house. This place needs to do some serious thinking about their pricing and teach their foodservers that if you are going to work at a place that is that pricey....the service better be tip top!I don't recall EVER dining with someone who has said, before ordering, "I wouldn't come back here".  Why?  Because we choose our dining out experiences carefully.  But one of my dinner companions declared it at Arrowhead last Monday evening, shortly after we ordered our pre-dinner cocktails.We chose Arrowhead because of the positive Yelp reviews - on which we have relied during our travels throughout the Southwest, West, Southeast, and our own Milwaukee/Chicago area.  I often scan the poor reviews, but disregard if there are an ample number of 4 or 5 stars and elaboration.  I was wrong this time.Ambiance: The entrance to this upscale steak/seafood restaurant is stunning, but once in the dining room - - - not so much.  The decor was uninteresting, stale, and not intimate.  A table candle (lighting was dim) or a fresh bloom on the table would have gone a long way.  (See posted photo.)  After all, this place advertises itself as "a new class of neighborhood grill".Service:  We waited a long time to order as our waiter seemed to have vanished (finished our wine and had our water glasses filled twice).   Had to ask the busboy to fetch him.  Yes, our steaks and Arctic char were good - but were served without garnish or flair.  A little parsley, lettuce, dill, kale leaf, or WHATEVER would have dressed the big white bare entree plates more like the entrees shown on the Arrowhead website.  Had to wait a bit longer for our side orders so we had time to stare at the starkness of the plates .  When the dishes arrived (Yukon gold mashed potatoes and creamed spinach) they were OK,  but not delicious and seemed as though they had been nuked from a frozen state.  This kind of "side" might be OK at home or at a chain eatery, but not at an "upscale" restaurant when one is paying extra for everything except for the piece of meat entree order.Again, the Delmonico steak, New York strip, and Arctic char were delicious, but we chose Arrowhead for a dining EXPERIENCE comparable to other 4/5 star reviewed restaurants that we've visited and enjoyed. This is a pricey restaurant that does not live up to it's potential.I had high hopes... The AG entry was beautifully decorated, but as you walk in to the dining room it became very simple. It is dark with a romantic feel. It's not very big either. Bottom line for what we paid, I want to feel like a fat, happy princess. Shrimp cocktail app was presented beautifully (over dry ice). The 3 shrimp were huge and very good, but if you have 4 people you can add another one? $16.99 plus $5.50 that's expensive in my book. The steaks were good and I recommend that if you are a Med rare person order it rare plus as it is served on a 400 degree plate and keeps cooking. The steaks had a nice flavor. The sides are all ala carte. The AG potatoes were very good, green beans also nice. My daughter who ordered off the kids menu wanted a little side of steamed broccoli, most places are accommodating to this, but we were charged the full $8.99. That was about the same as her meal. The specialty drink list was cool. The wine list in a Steak House should "wow" you... No I was not impressed. Service was so mediocre! Not at all what my bill demanded. Many reviews compare AG to Flemings, and I eat there all the time along with many other upscale steakhouses. Folks this is not in the same league. You ask why not 2 stars well the food did taste good and I'm on vacation so I'm more laid back.

Review Text :
The best thing about this place are the bathrooms! No Shit! Er, I mean no kidding!The decor in the bathroom is expensive, mimicking a Japanese ancient Castle, with large cuts on stone masonry, copper pots for sinks, and metal tubes to look like large bamboo as the faucets. The next best thing is the large stone in the middle of the room. It is a large rock with a spotlight on it, and mimicks a Japanese rock garden.The third best thing is the out door patio seating, with the misters going full blast as the tempurature still hovers around 100 at 11:00pm in August. There are several tables out there, and also some couches.The 4th best thing is the Pachinko machines in the entryway, brightly lit and real, However, as the cute hostess will tell you, she has no balls (for the pachinko machines, stupid!)The 5th best thing is their large drink menu of specialty drinks. I didn't look in there for an "Orgasm" or a "SloeComfortableScrew Against the Wall", or other ridiculous concoctions, etc. I felt like a Tanqueray and Tonic.  No, Make it two!The rest of what they have to offer is, well, meh!A coworker tried to make out with my boyfriend at happy hour here and I still freaking love it! I mean, what a great time, right? Sake bombers, sushi, random drunk broads coming on to your boyfriend because you spent too much time playing with the toilet controls in the bathroom?  Seriously girls, be careful in there.Thankfully, my boyfriend did not give in to Drunky McSluttersons advances. However, the fact that she even had the gall to attempt it is really a testament to how awesome Geisha A Go Go's happy hour is. Chick was wasted. Hard not to get drunk when everything on the damn drink menu is half off! I think we were drinking $3 beers and $1 Sakes. $1! Truly wonderful.The "House Maki" is half off also, which usually means basic rolls like California and Tuna, but nothing fancy. Geisha A Go Go's "House Maki" includes quite a few of the fancier roll selections, including one of my faves, the rainbow roll.  The sushi is really nothing to write home about, but when you got a nice buzz going on with aforementioned $1 Sakes, you don't really notice.To recap: Happy Hour is awesome, Sushi is Okay, Bathrooms are time consuming, Don't take slutty coworkers.I have never really been a fan of public masturbation, but then again, I had never been to Geisha A Go Go's restrooms before either. Ladies, they have an osculating bidet that has front and back controls.......There was a large (and excessively rowdy) group of us in one of the private Karaoke rooms celebrating Nathan S's 35th birthday this  past Saturday and I gotta say, I had a damn blast. We sang Love Shack and Sweet Caroline and Careless Wisperer. I even did an inappropriate duet to "Like A Virgin."Oh, and those pear vodka champagne drink things?? I unknowingly sucked down 6 of them. Thanks to Georgie S for making sure it was Grey Goose. Anyway, sure I paid $54, but I was seriously having the best drunken blast and I felt like I hadn't touched a drop the next morning.So, the waitress fucking hated us, but we had a g-damned blast. A BLAST. We twirled on poles, sang horrifically at the top of our lungs and probably contracted some diseases from the booths and carpets, but whatevs, it was a blast!And P.S... I never actually used the bidet.... really... for more than a secondSo things may have gotten off to a rocky start (losing our reservation for 13 and having to eat outside), but thanks to friendly service and yummy rolls, I found myself in a very forgiving mood. Is this place super authentic for you sushi snobs? Definitely no. But it's a fun atmosphere and there are plenty of options for vegetarians, and even non-sushi eaters (everyone loved the chicken teriyaki sliders). The most memorable item of the night for me was a roll featuring crushed fritos. Sounds gross, I know, but with the katsu sauce on it it tasted more like panko breading than corn chips. Most importantly, the cocktails are amazing - I could not get enough of my kiwi cocktail (I think it was called the kinky cooler - ignore the name and just try it!)After dinner, we piled into one of the private karaoke rooms and thanks to our helpful waitress and many sake bombs, we had a wonderful night. They were lacking some randomly important karaoke songs, but we managed to have a good time regardless. I have to say I thought we'd get more use out of the pole in the middle of the room though!Two very important notes, one good, one not so good:First, you MUST go to the bathroom. Anyone who's ever been curious about those fancy Japanese toilets will have a blast in the ladies' room (can't speak for the boys' room). I'm surprised they put them in because I bet on busy nights a long line must form as people are testing out all the fun, weird functions on the toilet. Second, a note to whoever writes the descriptions for the rolls on the menu: You may not have too many Asians in your life, but next time you're thinking of a way to describe your sushi, saying things like 'you no likey?' and 'herro!' are not appropriate and may be offensive to some!Sign me up for a return visit based on the eye candy alone. Every server here was a total smoke show! The amount of times I fell in love was the equivalent to the number of sake bombs I consumed (4) making my evening both easy on the eyes and buzzworthy. Even though I showed up late to meet my coworkers and the food was not exactly fresh, it was certainly apparent that for Scottsdale sushi this is a hot spot. Several of the rolls I tried were unique with innovative flavor combinations. For dessert we headed into the private karaoke rooms where I ordered a large humiliation sundae. My only caution is to be prepared for the most random song selection you've ever seen. With very minimal hip hop or 80's tunes and a heavy dose of Celine Dion, just be prepared to double my intake of bombs in order to be comfortable singing here.Wake me up, before you Geisha A Go Go...This place conjures up images of super cool Geisha chicks wearing modified robes (ie super short) with white boots dancing to "These Boots Are Made For Walking." I just love the fun vibe here, which is carried through to both the cocktail and sushi menus. It's not just about vibe, though. The food is Wham Bam Good!The veggie gyoza is possibly amongst the best I've ever had and I've had a lot in my time. I'm talking about whole edamame in the dumplings! Wrappers are slightly crisp, perfectly pan fried. I also recommend the tasty veg soba noodles. A very simple dish, but one that I all but inhaled, because it's perfectly prepared.The veggie sushi roll was slightly disappointing. As it's the only vegetarian sushi option that I found on the menu, I ordered it hoping for more than the usual carrot, cuc and...? (no avocado to be found and I think it should always be featured in a veggie roll to keep it from being too dry). The whole shebang is just really tasteless. The avo/cuc roll I ordered never arrived, but I know our large table ordered up so much that it's not really a big deal. If I had really wanted it, I would have asked for it. I do think that because Geisha is a post modern take on a sushi joint that they could stand to get creative with the vegetarian sushi rolls.Now, let's turn to the fun karaoke rooms! Never did the private room thang before and although the machines kind of confused us (as did the song choices, quite honestly), the super sweet and lovely waitresses/hostesses never left us hanging and tried to be of assistance whenever they could.Next time I'm back, I'll be singing my rendition of Wake Me Up Before You Go Go (what? I love that song!) in homage to all the geishas out there...wave your hands like you just don't care...oh, the possibilities are endless when you have a cocktail in one hand and mic in the other.Go Go here for happy hour! From 4-7pm you can delight in their half priced apps and specialty cocktails. Their sushi rolls are meh, but their teriyaki ribs are falling off the bone, finger lickin' good! The cocktails seem to be concocted for little Asian girls (which is odd since there are no Asian girls in Scottsdale, especially now that my BFF and I are gone) - fruity with cutesy names like "Hello Kitty," "Harajuku Lover," "Shiso Horny," and "Kinki Kooler" just to name a few. My favorite was the "Turning Japanese" which was like biting into a vodka infused pear.Service at the bar was wonderful - Victoria is the one of the cutest bartenders in Old Town (guys, go pay her a visit). Drinks were flowing and the food came out quickly.In addition to the happy hour and Victoria, make sure you check out their restrooms and private karaoke rooms, complete with "entertainment" poles. If you end up spending a long time on their Toto toilets, people will understand why. Seat warmer and a bidet? You'll want to take your business there on a daily basis.i went here for a friends birthday party. everything was just mediocre. the waitress was super nice and great at recommending drinks. i had the kiwi one...totally recommend it. i am not sure what their system is but it's a mess. they kept bringing random sushi rolls that no one ordered and then they would get pissed like we playing a trick on them or something. then they wouldn't bring some rolls out at all so people were waiting forever. then people had rolls on their tabs that they didn't even order. it was a mess.I've been here a few times already and just now realized I haven't left a review!Sunday is the best day to come here. Half off sushi and drinks... fabulous all day happy hour. If you're not into sushi (and therefore, you're crazy) just get the rock shrimp bowl... amazing. They also have different flavors of sake (pomegranate is a fav) and sake bombers as well (Sapporo is in large bottles; Kierin is in small bottles). There's a DJ, and karaoke, and lots of beautiful people. Go here.Let me start by saying when you come here get the Hello Kitty martini! Don't ask questions just get it! lol. I've been here a few times and I really do enjoy coming here. I ALWAYS get the hello kitty martini. The name just speaks for itself. It comes with Pinnacle citrus, Japanese strawberry soda, and fruit infused Sake. Yummy!!! For food, I always get the Gaijin roll. It's like a chimicanga type sushi roll. I know, it sounds weird but it's actually quite tasty. I don't usually do hand rolls, and I've never gotten a philly hand roll before but omg, I loved it! The only negative thing about this place is it can be a bit pricey during regular hours. However, they do have happy hour everyday from 3-7 and half off ALL drinks on Sundays. The service is also really good. We were always checked on and they're also very knowledgeable about everything. I need to come back during happy hour and Sundays! =)

I was first introduced to Tomos in celebration of my brother and my girlfriend's birthday.  Since then, it has become my favorite sushi joint in the west valley!Tomos keeps their restaurant dimly lit and there's plenty of bar space [sushi and alcohol] available.  I've only been here for dinner so I have yet experienced their lunch or Happy Hour special but I can't imagine those being anything less than delicious.  For appetizers, their monkey balls, soft shell crab, the ninja jalapenos, and oyster shooters are delicious [warning:  raw quail egg].  Some of my favorite rolls are the Passion of Fire [pity they don't bring this lit on fire anymore], the Dysart Roll, Crunch Roll, Cowboy Roll, Dragon Roll, Spider Roll, and Popcorn Lobster.  The sashimi is always thickly cut and Ocean Salad is great too.Tomos is the best sushi you can get in the west valley!

Review Text :
I've never expected great decor from Vietnamese eateries, but a Viet restaurant inside in 50's style diner is something I've never thought I'd see.  It's strange but understandable after the economic crash and restaurants closing over night causing property owners to rent out space quickly and cheaply.Lemongrass is the exact place where you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.  It serves up some of the most authentic everyday Vietnamese dishes, there are even a couple of specialties I've never seen anywhere else in Vegas.There are the standard Pho noodle soups, vermicelli noodle salads, and Banh Mi sandwiches, which allow me to never have to drive to Chinatown if I have a craving for the usual fare.But if you're a non-Vietnamese and have never had something besides the dishes listed above, let me draw your attention to a few Viet offerings that are less-known but just as delicious:1. Stuffed Calamari: fresh squid stuffed with minced glass noodle, shrimp, and ground pork and then deep fried.  This dish is time-consuming to make and doesn't yield too much profit (which explains why I've mainly had it home-made) but completely yummy.2.  Tuna in Tomato Sauce: a peasant favorite that stands the test of time; it brings me back to the days of when my grandma used to cook this for me.  It sounds simple and it is: tuna filets are fried and then topped with crushed tomatoes with garlic and basil.  Simplicity in peasant food is usually what makes it so emotional.3.  Lotus Salad: usually seen at parties, a rare exception (we don't have too many salads) in Vietnamese cuisine that works.  Thin pieces of lotus stems are mixed with jicama, pork, shrimp, and mint, then topped with roasted peanuts and served with tamarind fish sauce.  A healthy alternative as an appetizer or main entree.You never forget your first love or your first.....time. This is where I nervously had my Pho cherry popped a while ago so it has always been special to me. Let's just say my first time was A-MAZING and I fell in love with Pho and Lemongrass Cafe on that day.- It's always hot and spicy - Cures hangovers and helps with head colds - No noodle and all white meat action works with my low carb lifestyle - While it travels from my pallet to my belly the warmth brings me peace and calm......a Culinary Nirvana. - Using chopsticks makes me happy (it's the small things in life) After being to several other Vietnamese spots Lemongrass is my go to for Chicken Pho. All white meat, fresh veggies, and a small that I cannot finish is $6.95. I usually get mine without the noodles and extra side of peppers and load it up with hoisin and chili sauce, etc. They never skimp on the amount of meat or it's quality. It's quite simply, Pho done right. I would also like to live a little and try a fried egg Banh Mi here eventually. The service is consistantly attentive, friendly, and quick. The owner always greets me with a smile and welcomes me. I especially enjoy this when I am here by myself in sweaty gym clothes which is frequent. (Yes, I am the sweaty white girl in the corner. Don't hate. My Pho is spicier than yours.) The restaurant is always very clean down to the ladle spoons and ramekins for the sauce if you are a dipper;) I would gladly give Lemongrass 5 stars, but my one issue is that the temperature never seems right in here. I purposely keep a sweatshirt in my car just for Lemongrass in the event it's freezing. I've been there a few times where I hadn't been to the gym before, but the temperature was so "off" I had a fancy boob sweat line when I was done eating. I know, sexy. Now that it's not Africa hot outside I imagine I will be craving Pho more than my average twice a week. TRUST I will be at Lemongrass Cafe fo' sho' fo ' a hot bowl of Vietnamese goodness to soothe my soul and take me back to that happy place.....Random that it is in an old diner.  They have Heu tieu on the menu!  My favorite dish when I visit Vietnam.  Not nearly as good here, but the closest I've gotten to it here at home.  The broth is a good flavor.  Thin clear noodles. The seafood in it is not fresh so that is the main downfall.  I still like it better than pho. The pho tastes good.  The fresh spring rolls were very good and clean tasting. Had an overall good experience.

We decided to hit up the "Wine Down Wednesday" that was happenin' at Tastings courtesy of KYOT.  Here's what went wrong:The event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held.We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby.20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine.It's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um, you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago...By now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much, but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.  By now, the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts, get some apps, and have our own "Wine Down Wednesday" at home.I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily, but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food, but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However, any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of "if I could give them less than 1 star I would" comes in...Oh yeah, and I slapped down a "You've been Yelped" card as I left.Take that Tastings!!

Review Text :
The only thing that could've possibly made my meal at The Estate House any worse, is if we had to pay for it...My bf and I stopped by for a drink on the night of their grand opening about 2 weeks ago... it was beautiful and the staff was pleasant; many of them my bf knew from previous workplaces.  So, he decided to have his birthday dinner there.  BIG MISTAKE!The meal we had last night was a comedy of errors... First off, there were 12 of us there and the way that they sat us (in the Butler's Pantry) was not ideal for our group.  We took things into our own hands and pushed our 2 tables together to make it easier to talk amongst ourselves.  Although Roman (I think that was our waiter's name) had good intentions, our service was horrendous!  We had to ask for menus after a half hour of being seated.  We had to ask for bread several times before it arrived probably an hour later, and then some of us (like myself) never even received any bread.  We also had to ask for water and drink refills throughout the 3 HOURS we were there...The menu itself was extremely pricey and fairly limited.  Not only that, but the menu lists a special 'tasting menu' but somehow it wasn't available yet... nor were there any specials.  We all finally decided and were able to place our order.One thing that the staff was good at was clearing and bringing back fresh silverware.  I think they moved my silverware around 3 times even though I would've been good with just one set.  Since they cleared my silverware that I hadn't touched before appetizers were finally served, I had no fork even if I wanted to sample from someone else's order... The Wild Arugula Salad that was supposed to arrive with "Warm Camembert," toasted marcona almonds and  blood orange vinaigrette arrived cold and all 3 people that ordered it had to send it back... other appetizers that arrived and some of the people in our party ate were the mussels and the winter squash risotto.  So, like I said, our reservation was for 7:30 and we were all seated by 7:45... so, when I looked at my watch and saw it was after 9:30. I was a little bit disappointed that our entrees weren't there yet.  After all, we were planning on meeting some other friends for drinks after dinner, and this was taking a really long time.  I think that everyone else at the table was feeling the same way.  We were all hungry and antsy and upset that the waiter or GM hadn't even acknowledged that it was taking a ridiculously long time.  So, the birthday boy spoke up... and asked for the GM.  I think it took another 30 minutes before the GM came over and acknowledged us.  Note - the food was still not there.  He was reactive instead of proactive apologizing but not offering anything.  He asked what we wanted him to do and we all just said to bring our food!  At this point it was 10pm.  He promised it would be there in 5 minutes.  Ron (another member of our group) looked at his watch and 5 minutes later, still no food.  Roman attempted to bring us a bottle of wine, but we didn't even want more to drink at this point...So, at about 10:10. our food began to arrive in piece meal...  2-3 entrees at a time and several minutes apart.  Many of the entrees were overcooked and had to be sent back and the person that ordered marlin was served tuna by accident so when the person that ordered the tuna didn't have her meal, we figured out their mistake.  The waiter then had the audacity to ask the person that ordered the tuna if she wanted a new one.  (There was already a bite taken out of the tuna that was served in error).  Of course she did!  Unfortunately, we were all done 20 minutes later when the new tuna finally arrived.  I had the "Estate House Fruit De Mer" which was actually pretty good.  (However, at 10pm, anything would've been good in my eyes).  We basically had to tell the GM that there was no way we were going to pay for this horrendous meal... you would think we'd get apologies again or something, but no.  We left a decent tip for Roman, and never even had birthday cake for the birthday boy... bummer!  At that point we just wanted to get the hell out of there!Fortunately, we had much better service upstairs at the 3rd floor level bar where they had a piano player until 11pm.  We met some other friends there and attempted to laugh at the miserable meal we'd just had... Side note - Charles Barkley and his wife were also at the restaurant and had a 3 hour meal as well - we know this because we swapped stories over drinks upstairs after the fact.The Estate House has a lot of kinks to work on... I doubt I will ever return to eat there again... I do recommend going for the ambiance and drinks on the top level.  Gina and Bill will take good care of you there... Aside from that, I would tell you to save your time and $$.Two years is a long time... I had the FTR for this restaurant over two years ago.  It was the worst review I've ever written for any business.  If you'd asked me two years ago to return to The Estate House, there was no way I'd say yes.But in two years, this place has really come a long way... I believe the three star bump I'm giving to my original review is thanks to Zoran, the GM, Chef Gio Osso, and a crew of friendly and attentive staff.  The Estate House is still as beautiful as I remember it being in February 2008, but it's perhaps even more beautiful now that they've got the ambiance, cuisine, and service to go with the physical beauty.My evening kicked off with a little mixer on the outdoor third floor patio.  Service was fantastic and drinks were strong.  I corresponded with guests at the mixer, but also with many of the Estate House staff.  From there, I went downstairs for a lovely dinner with my husband.  While the menu is still on the fancy side for me, I was pleased with everything from the appetizers to the dessert.  We ordered the Burrata and Scallop appetizers, and were served way too much fresh bread to start as well... Turns out they were out of Burrata but replaced it with the smoothest, creamiest, largest pillow of Mozzarella I've ever had.  We cleaned both plates.  Jared went with the Moroccan Seven Spice Grilled Lamb entree and I chose the Honey Saba Lacquered Black Cod.  Both were unique preparations with a ton of flavor.  I could've done without the candied pancetta on the cod, but that didn't stop me from eating way too much.  In addition, we had grilled asparagus and sauteed spinach... (the greens balance out everything else, right?!)We were stuffed but were joined by a couple of friends for dessert and shared the bread pudding and a chocolate peanut butter special... both were fabulous.  All of this while enjoying a bottle of wine.Needless to say, I am extremely happy I gave The Estate House another shot.  They've come a long way in two years, and I anticipate returning again soon.  I encourage you to do the same.**They are now open for lunch (which I must say looks very reasonable), and they have all kinds of special events including Cooking Classes, Easter Brunch, Simple Sunday Dinners, etc...I ate here during Restaurant Week and it was acceptable. The setting is lovely, without question. The decor is impeccable! But, the food was just OK. If it wasn't Restaurant Week pricing, I think I would've been disappointed. I had the rock shrimp ceviche which was topped with too much mediocre guacamole. The swordfish was simple and cooked very well. Simple is a good thing with fish, in my opinion. It had good flavor. I really enjoyed the tomatoes that accompanied it.  The fingerling potatoes were acceptable (though, they could have used a bit more seasoning). My dessert, Baba au Rhum, was OK. I notice none of these items, except the fingerlings, are on the regular menu but it seems you'd put your best foot forward during Restaurant Week, when you can count on some new customers who have been looking for an excuse to try your restaurant to seize the moment. In this case, they didn't create a new regular.

Working late one night, I was looking for some Pizza delivery and found this place on Yelp.  After browsing their menu online, I decided to order a 14" Brooklyn Family Pizza (Sausage, Pepperoni, Basil, $15.79) well done.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WScGH9XsG8-XF_HLqviAgw?select=tJ6uKGCt903Th6DBV33z4gThe Pizza was delivered pretty quickly and I couldn't wait to take a bite.  The Pizza looked sooo good!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WScGH9XsG8-XF_HLqviAgw?select=RbJzxEMNjbizWpuurVp5lgWhen I picked up a Slice, it had that NY Pizza "bend" to it.....good sign!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WScGH9XsG8-XF_HLqviAgw?select=p1vayQYRY2Eync2nFsXo8QI took a bite and it was good!  The Sausage had a nice combination of Sweet & Spicy flavors and went well with the Pepperoni.  The Cheese was gooey and the Basil was just right...I think I'm going to add Basil to my standard order of Pepperoni & Sausage if a Pizza joint offers it.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WScGH9XsG8-XF_HLqviAgw?select=Mi2V4PgUyxU-PQGwDQRBtAOverall, I was very satisfied with NYPD Pizza!Return Factor - 100%

Restaurant name  Caffè Italia
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Busy, loud, lively, fast, somewhat chaotic - that's how I would describe Caffè Italia. A cafe that doesn't try to pretend to be what it's not and stays true to what it is - a historic icon where local patrons in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s+ drop in for their espresso, dunk their panettone, watch some sports, pay (cash) and then leave to carry on their day.Open from 7am till 11pm this place just never seems to stop. Sitting at the bar you'll often see an order of 10 or more cups that come all at once! Amazingly no words are exchanged between waiters and the Barrista. I was trying to decode the system, a combo of saucer, glass spoons and positions that minimizes the need to talk and focus on delivery! Spoon in cup means decaf, two spoons on plate is an allongé, spoon down is double shot, etc.Tip: Don't try to sit at the corner table unless you're looking for dirty looks. This where the older italian men hang out to talk about soccer, politics and sometimes about weather. "Keep it real is what it's all about... Montrealers like it like that" I was told by a regular. You won't see any fancy foam art but the crema is thick, exactly what you would expect from fresh coffee beans being hit at the right temperature and 12 bars of pressure. All drinks are very reasonably priced: Espresso at $1.75 and Latte or Cappuccino at $2.75!  Food-wise staples are mortadella, capicollo or salami sandwiches, toasts with choice of jam, peanut butter or Nutella and your traditional variety of italian sweets. Interestingly enough, behind the counter, where cigarettes packs used to be displayed, you can get hard to find Italian men grooming items such as Proraso (Italy #1 shaving cream), Felce Azzura (Talc Powder) and Pastel del Capitano (italian toothpaste).The original owner is a nice lady who just recently celebrated her 76th birthday. She inherited the cafe from her parents who moved from Italy and opened this place when she was 16! The place is now run by her two daughters backed by a clever Barista (Paolo) and staff that crack you up if you pay attention to what they are saying. No frills, no fuss just good caffè - this is what it's all about.

Review Text :
Sometimes you just dont get what you pay for. Like paying nearly 5 bucks for a large frozen yogurt and getting a less then half full cup. Then a buck for the first topping which was so stingy. I chose mochi and seriously, there were about 6 pieces. Were not talking quality over quantity here.. the frozen yogurt was good, very light sour yogurt taste, not much tang. I make the same recipe at home and its good but not 6 bucks a cup good. Maybe the lady there at Chill saw my fat ass and decided that she needed to put me on a diet! I did have a taste of the gelato and thought it was really good.. I think if I go here again I will certainly stick with the gelato.. seems that those cups are literally packed. You live you learn.People often make the mistake of assuming I know what I'm doing. That I'm a woman with a plan. It's an easy error to make; I'm a somewhat articulate woman working towards a bachelor's degree who holds multiple state credentials. Yeah, I guess a certificate with a photocopied signature on it can count as credentials, right? But in reality, there is no method to the madness. Like a jazz soloist or a Republican defending anti-gay marriage laws, I'm just making this shit up as I go along. I am often overwhelmed by seemingly trivial decisions, like "what color should I paint my nails today" or "should I give this place 1 or 2 stars?" Places like Coldstone or Baskin Robbins, therefore, frustrate me to no end.Do I get a flavor I know I'll like? Or do I branch out? But what if that flavor's totally nasty and I can't finish it? What mix-ins should I get? Oh god there are people in line behind me, make up your mind, voice in my head!!!When Amanda B brought me to Chill, the first thing I noticed was the wide array of gelato flavors. Immediately, I felt myself paralyzed with indecision. Oh shit. Pineapple and Coconut? Dulce de Leche? Sweet Zombie Jesus, they have a Twix flavor! Oh Eris, goddess of cha--oh wait, you wouldn't do me any good in this situation, would you?Off-handed, perhaps sensing my panic, Amanda's sister Allison grinningly said to me "you've got to try the chocolate pistachio. It's the best."At first I was a little hesitant to take her suggestion. While chocolate is awesome and pistachio is awesome, 2 x awesome does not always awesome squared. Other examples of two awesome things that suck when put together; Babies and movie theaters. Girlfriends and strip clubs. Roleplaying games (fuck yeah I slayed a dragon!) and the internet (sorry guys, I can't go out tonight, gotta stay home and do a raid with my guild).But Allison assured me that this would be all the chocolatey pistachio goodness I could ever ask for. I was sold. Legend has it that once, an Italian merchant once gave Buddha a bowl of gelato. Buddha was so delighted with the dessert that he reciprocated the gesture and gave the merchant a book of Buddhist teachings to bring back with him to Italy. Unfortunately the merchant's ship was sunk on the voyage home, and Buddhism didn't reach Italy for hundreds of years.What does that have to do with my review? Nothing. The chocolate pistachio really was amazing. And at 2.59 for a small it has a reasonable cost/delicious ratio (I'm assuming anyway. Allison covered me in the event I didn't like mine so she could finish it herself). I may not be as well versed in the art and science of gelato as others, but I can tell you from my limited experience that it was creamy, chocolatey, smooth, nutty and everything I am told gelato is supposed to be. Maybe next time I will choose a flavor by myself. But I wouldn't count on it. I was late for work today because I couldn't decide which pair of pink flip flops would better match my Sarah Jessica Parker jeans. I am completely flabbergasted as to how I get out as much as I do.08/31/11Stumbled onto Chill while exploring the area before settling down for dinner (at Lobby's).  The clerk here was friendly and accommodating w/ sample requests.  After dinner, I came back and ordered a cup of three flavors: dark chocolate, chocolate sugar-free, and panna cotta.  I was delighted w/ all of them!  Surprisingly, my favorite of the three flavors I'd ordered was the one I had not sampled beforehand, the sugar-free chocolate.  I definitely will be back!Psst!  Don't forget to take a loyalty card w/ you, as she may forget to mention it!

Review Text :
Irish pubs are really my favorite places to eat, drink, and be merry.  Last Friday we knew we were meeting Tim S. for dinner at Cibo, so why not leave the 'burbs and go try some other places I have bookmarked on Yelp and just make a day of it?  Tim Finnegan's was on the list and we had a great lunch.  We started with the mussels app which had some of the best broth I've ever had with mussels.  It was a little spicy, but not too much, and they put noodles in there which I've never seen before, but they soaked up the broth very nicely and made the meal more substantial.  I also really like the brown bread that came with it.  Mr. M ordered the lunch portion fish and chips and I ordered the Rasher burger.  You know the food is good when there is very little talking, just eating.  That's what we did for the next 20 minutes, passing bites of fish and burger across our plates to each other and sharing the fries and green beans.  All perfectly done all the way around.  The fish was nice and light with very tasty fries.  My burger was really exceptional and on par with the great burgers I've had at Fibber Magees and Skeptical Chymist.  Some of the best burgers I've had in this city were at places that don't market themselves as a burger joint.  With a pint of Kilkenny, Guinness, and sharing one of Harp, our total before tax and tip was $36.23.  They have a great Yelp check-in deal and you can get the appetizer for free if you purchase two entrees.    I loved the atmosphere with all the dark wood and small tables and booths.  Kristen took good care of us at the bar and we enjoyed her banter with some of the regular patrons.  I wish we lived closer to Tim Finnegan's, but now that we've given it a try, we'll be back for sure.

Recently opened, this new Herb Box location is doing some business!  I went for lunch today with a friend, and we had to wait 30 minutes to get seated!  Aside from the hostesses being a bit clueless (they didn't know if the menu at this location was the same as the other or not), we enjoyed our meal.The location used to be Cafe Citron - they did a great job fixing it up.  One side is the eatery and the other is the market... and an outdoor patio is a plus!  They've still got some kinks to work on with service, but the food is just as good as the other location; especially those sweet potato chips!My friend had the 'Urban Market Steak Salad' and I have to say, it looked much better than my 'Albacore Tuna Salad Pita' was... I think that the rent may be higher in this location since the menu prices seemed even higher than those at the other location too.  Not positive though.  I recommend this place if you don't mind spending $12 - $20 on lunch... amazing sweet potato chips, chicken chile, sandwiches, salads, and baked goods too.  I'm sure they do a great job with catering, but I don't know that from experience, just a hunch.I found another winner today on the menu at Herb Box... I changed it up a bit and ordered the Market Veggie Pita; it was really good too!  Inside a light pita wrap was a combo of garden salad & red pepper hummus... it came with my fave sweet potato chips and a side of grapes.  All for $9.  Add an iced tea and it's a wonderful lunch!  I also noticed another new addition to the menu at this location:  the Crisp Coconut Shrimp Salad; i'll have to remember to try that next time!I also have to remember to try herb box for dinner - I haven't been yet, but the menu looks fantastic!I sat at the bar with my friend and had attentive service from Joy... We would've had to wait for a table, but the bar worked out well.  Still a huge fan of the Herb Box - if you haven't been, go!Herb Box- DC Ranch is my new fav eatery for organic, locally grown, tasty lunches!Yesterday we took to the kids and started off with their mango (or papaya- I get the two confused) lemonade.  REALLY sweet, but a cool exotic flavor.  BTW, it is great to find a place that welcomes kids without being a true "kids restaurant".  Couples, singles, families, you name it- you've got the gamut of customers here.We had the BBQ Chicken Flat-bread Pizza and Free Range chicken-arugula wrap with candied walnuts and cranberries.  Today (yeah it was so good we had to come back a day later) had the Market Street Tacos- with fillet, fresh avocados, and some sort of what I call "magic sauce" while the kids split the turkey on a cibata (sp?) sandwich.  Hooooooly cow!!  Imagine an explosion of flavors (all wonderful) sparking in your mouth at once.  it is like a symphony of flavors- each one distinct yet complementary to the other.  Honest to goodness magic to your taste buds.  Of course a restaurant review could never get 5 stars unless it has great service- which it did.  But it also had a little something extra.  Great atmosphere, AMAZING food, and a highly textured (and blended femininity and masculinity) decor.  And the overall vibe was very cool.  Not too snotty (even though some of the customers are), relaxed, and open feeling push the Herb Box over the top to receive a 5 star rating.  I don't know what they serve (or if they are even open for breakfast or dinner), but for lunch, this is a perfect choice.  Now that I've belatedly discovered the location in DC Ranch (their Shea location had catered for us before), you will see me here more often.  Hopefully you will enjoy it as much as my family and I do!  Best wishes.Warmly,Kirin :)****this review is based on breakfast menu only************** Since I love the lunch and dinner soo much I thought I would go for Sunday brunch. First off they had a horrible selection of breakfast, they dont even serve french toast or omelets or breakfast sandwiches. They had a egg breakfast, which is what I got. Consisted of 2 eggs with cheese and bacon and tomato and avocado slices on the side. First off I give it 1 star for appearance. It looked worse that what I could have made at home. The bacon was soggy the eggs were looking like neon yellow and clearly a boxed egg. (which should not be the case with a place like herb box for 9 buck for box eggs and soggy bacon) I could have made it way better at home Jamie got the buckwheat pancakes since they didn't have an option to have buttermilk. The pancakes were super super dry and almost gritty. It said it came with strawberries... I'm not kidding you it was a half strawberry cut in 3 small pieces. It also had dried blueberries which were actually soo gross I could not believe they would not use the fresh ones. Aside from that the only other thing on the menu was custard donut and hot cocoa for 9 bucks wtf? a 9 dollar donut. a bowl of oatmeal for 6 bucks breakfast burrito which the guy next to us got and he took it back. He said it was litterally egg and dry black beans unseasonedI saw the size and it was like 2 breakfast taquitos.There where like 2 more things but I cant think of itIf you want the breakfast herbox should have go to arcadia farms.Yeah ! I am happy to find this as good as had hoped , boo it's  really a trek and not on  my paper route as dear ABU would say. In the quaint  DC Ranch  set aglow with beautiful white lights sits this yummy  bistro/market . We were tempted by many great looking items on the menu but settled for the pizza. It was  delicious. Both the Cappicola Pizza as well as the Gorgonzola and Pear pizza  tasted outstanding. Both possessed a certain pizzazz that made you want more.  The food that we saw ordered around us made us wish we had room for more just to try out the many small dishes we saw come out. Can't wait to go back!Since my sister's recent move, I've been finding myself up at DC Ranch more often and I was happy to see that The Herb Box was till alive and kicking! I like this location because it feels almost like you are in a small vacation town on the river, like a Sun River, Oregon and enjoying the weather and atmosphere with some refreshing and pretty healthy food. The menu here is the same as the other location and I really enjoy the wraps, Cesar salad (with Chicken added), coconut shrimp salad, hummus, enchiladas and pretty much everything else! When I eat here, I like to sit on the patio and soak in the sunlight, but the interior is just as refreshing as well. That's about all I have to say since everyone else has pretty much said it all. This is a great restaurant option for lunch with friends or dinner with a date.I had an "herb box" in college I remember. Kept it under my bed. Or in the back of the closet. Or in a shoe. Gee, that was some herb I can't even remember...This Herb Box however, I shan't ever forget!!!Butternut Squash Enchiladas. White Bean Chicken Chili. Crab Cilantro Dip. The Zucchini soup of the day...ALL...outstanding!!!Now that I've moved back to DC Ranch I'm so glad to see the Herb Box and even more excited that this is my new "Cheers". Sorry Gallo Blanco, though I miss you madly...I've found another relationship. And no it's not complicated!Quite simple in fact. Delicious, fresh ingredients. Delightful, warm staff and a cozy and bright spot on Market Street.I've been here with family. With friends. And even a date. Herb Box, if I stick around AZ long enough, I just may ask you to marry me!So step outside of your "box" and head to The Herb Box. But call me first and I will meet you there!!!Herb Box is always delicious and meow, I can add a delicious breakfast experience to my repertoire! While in DC Ranch during the breakfast hour, I was happy to learn that the DC Ranch Herb Box location serves breakfast on both Saturday and Sunday (not just Sunday like the Old Town location). I ordered the breakfast burrito with egg whites and avocado. The meal was fresh and filling but not overly heavy. The environment is casual but classy and perfect for any type of diner, whether it be a family or friends. When the weather's nice, they have the perfect patio where you can enjoy a Mimosa with your meal!6/9/13My first visit at this Herb Box location- didn't know it was so much closer to where I live than that one at Southbridge!  Decided to sit outside since it was so noisy indoors** and especially when the misters were on full blast outside.  [The misters were both a blessing and a curse- while they did cool the area, the water did have a certain odor to them (a manager at another resto previously warned me not to park my car close to their misters, since the water contained erosive compounds), and I didn't want whatever was added to the water to contaminate my food and drinks.)  Ordered water and green tea with blackberry and jasmine essences http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-herb-box-scottsdale-6?select=ACjM4QrTvrI6Og5q-cQNSg#ACjM4QrTvrI6Og5q-cQNSg and the Blackened salmon BLT. The unsweetened tea was clean-tasting and refreshing, and was a welcome palate cleanser after I had my fill of the terrific salmon BLT, which came with two juicy filets of wild-caught salmon, wild arugula, tomato, smoked applewood bacon, and red pepper aioli on toasted ciabatta, plus a side of house-made sweet potato chips. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-herb-box-scottsdale-6?select=MQz07Ic5tPQfAjnVVqnurg#MQz07Ic5tPQfAjnVVqnurg  It took a lot of willpower not to eat more than half of the sandwich (I actually sliced a tiny portion off of the second-half- tsk, tsk!), but in hindsight, a half-portion plus some SPC satisfied until late happy hour/early dinner.  Afterwards, I asked my server if it would be safe to leave my Kindle on the table while I go wash my hands, and she said yes.  When I went back outside to do a bit of reading, I noticed the umbrella over my table was removed and my boxed leftovers, beverages, and e-reader were on another table- what the - ?  Were they in such a rush to see me off?  I could understand the busser mistakenly thinking I'd forgotten the food, but seeing the e-reader would've clued him/her of the possibility that I was returning, so one would think that the items would still be on the original table when I returned, so why were they moved to another AND the umbrella taken away?  The other tables still had umbrellas overhead... Very strange.  I also realized that I didn't have time to read after glancing at my watch, and with bill on hand, I tried to pay at the register by the pastry case, since my server was busy taking care of other customers outside, but the bartender (whom I asked if I could get some assistance at the register) and manager (?), whom the bartender motioned to come over, became confused, until my server rushed indoors to ask me what was going on.  I said I didn't know it was so late, that I needed to make it to an appointment in Tempe in 20 minutes, so I was trying to find someone else to help me with the bill.  She said only she could take care of it, and that it needed to be done at the bar.  OK, whatever you need to do, I just had to get going!  (I started to wonder if they thought I was going to rush out without paying?!)Besides these few glitches in service, I'd otherwise give four stars.  Maybe next visit will be better...**It was lunchtime, but by no means packed with people, so I wondered why it was so noisy?This venue is so incredibly cute, especially at night! Its right next to the Grayhawk golf course and has quite the "upscale" feel to it, even though it is a smaller location and very affordable.  This is the perfect place for date night, yet, if youre coming in on the weekend, I would suggest making a reservation. I like the menu style with the "farm to table" feel. The menu has a "healthier" look to it, but you dont sacrifice flavor thats forsure. When I went... I ordered the Smoked Gouda Mac and cheese with garlic breadcrumbs...(NEED I SAY MORE!?) and Thai style ribs that just fell off the bone. These really were the best ribs I've ever had, with a different flavor which was refreshing. I've had good BBQ ribs before, but this was a whole different twist. I would definitely recommend it. They have an outdoor patio and sometimes play live acoustic music... not quite sure when though, I forgot which weekdays. I've only been here for the dinners, but I would love to come back for their breakfast... also heard they have an amazing brunch on sundays.

Review Text :
After visiting The container Store for a longer span of time than we thought we would, it was high time for dinner.  Eyeballing the several offerings of Town Square, we came across this California Pizza Kitchen.  There was a wait everywhere on this Friday night, but here it didn't appear to be intolerable.  So, we put in our name and waited to be called.  After about 20 minutes the lights on our pager finally glowed red and danced about.  Now hungrier than ever, we prepared to settle in our comfortable booth and enjoy a multi-course dinner at a relaxed pace.  We were not ready to rumble, but to EAT!So, I began with Minced Chicken Lettuce Wraps, while Diane looked forward to an opening side of Traditional Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese.  The Lettuce Wraps were excellent, featuring fine chicken, tiny curved water chestnuts, jalapeno circles, very fresh and crisp lettuce leaves, and a nice soy-based spicy dipping sauce.  I did find though that the Cherry Limeade I also ordered was too strong for my taste.The Mac 'N' Cheese had an excellent crisp crust, and was firm on the inside--not mushy.  The whole dish was quite yummy.Unfortunately our Garlic Cream Fettuccine entrees then arrived right on top of our starters.  I sent mine back, but Diane accepted hers, which contained sauteed chicken and shrimp.  When my entree arrived again at a more suitable time, it was just like Diane's, except mine was further enhanced by sauteed mushrooms.  The sauteing was first-rate, the fettuccine was al dente, and just enough Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce clung to the pasta to make this a truly delectable dish.  The portions were large, with an ample amount of chicken breast chunks and medium- to large-sized shrimps.  We both enjoyed our hot entrees immensely.But how is a fine dinner truly complete without a sumptuous dessert?  So, I finished with a towering slice of 6-layer Lemon Cake with Lemon Custard Filling, while Diane dug into a large slice of 5-layer Red Velvet Cake.  My high-caloric sweet treat was brushed with Limoncello, candied lemon zest, and Mascarpone Frosting, and was very lemony and delicious.  Diane's was topped by a creamy and very tasty Cream Cheese Frosting.  We were both in dessert nirvana.One other service delay must be mentioned.  Diane seemed to wait forever for a Hot Chocolate.  We were ultimately told by both our server and the manager that the bartender on duty makes all Hot Chocolate drinks, and got behind making that and other ordered drinks.  Finally, the manager hustled over to our table with the Hot Chocolate way late, but did take it off the bill.  And then Diane found it to be too thin.Even though our dining experience was marred by two service errors, the food was so delicious that we just brushed these minor inconveniences aside, and this outing still rated an overall 4-1/2 stars!I had a gift card and decided to place an order for pick-up. This CPK is located in Town Square. There is a pick-up door, but if there is parking near it I couldn't find it. Crowded is the proper word for Town Square! With no parking spot in sight and tons of people wandering around, hubby dropped me off out front. I was greeted when I walked in and the food was ready. The pizza came in a to-go carrier with handles that was very convenient. I ordered the "Untraditional Cheese Pizza" priced at $9.75 that was cheesy and good. Most pizzas with more than one cheese have a smokey type of cheese on it and this one didn't, which I loved. Simple and good! You can place your pick-up order over the phone or online. The online ordering is very user friendly.California Pizza Chicken... in Nevada!! (get your own pizza chicken  ....)Went here for my cousins graduation dinner with a party of about 17, and we all ended up sitting outside in the patio, SEPARATELY. It would have been nicer if they could have seated all of us at one big table formed by many little ones, instead separating the whole family. ;(I ended up sitting with my dad and uncle, both who ordered fish tacos while I ordered the wild mushroom pizza. All which came with complimentary bread and oil. Let me cut to the chase:- WILD MUSHROOM PIZZAI was very disappointed after trying this pizza. The crust may have been perfectly soft, but for 13.99? I don't think so. It was not even that good.- FISH TACOSI stole one of my dad's fish taco's and thought they were bomb. The two avocado slices helped finish me off into oblivion. However, the tortilla and fish was a little to dry for me.- BREAD AND OILAll though these were complimentary, I actually enjoyed eating these more than the pizza and tacos. The bread might have been a little too hard on the outside, but it was so dam soft on the inside. Combined with the oil, I would have been fine just eating this instead of the main dishes!!- SERVICEI think something was wrong with our server.. She told me that my pizza will be out "shortly". I soon realized she said that 20 minutes ago. 20 minutes is not short!!!!My uncle also asked for a refill for his beer, which ended up taking 10 minutes to refill -_-. She didn't even apologize!!I don't have a review for CPK yet?? Oh no, gotta change that. Their Townsquare location is the main one I visit since it's the closest to home and since Townsquare always has a nice feel with all the trees and everything. Let's start with service, sometimes it's a hit or miss with the servers but generally pretty good. One thing that they're really good at is keeping wait times low even though it gets crazy.Onto the food! I've loved everything I've tried here except for their Jambalaya Pasta. That dish scarred me Lol idk if they made it wrong or something but that just had a horrible flavor. I had my boyfriend taste it too and he said it was pretty bad Lol. But thankfully that's the only bad thing I've had.My current favorites are the Avocado Club Eggrolls, Cedar Plank Salmon, Tequila Fettucine, Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza & Pear/Gorgonzola Pizza on Hand-Tossed Crust. I'm not a fan of thin crust at all so I'm happy that they can make any of the thin-crust pizzas on regular hand-tossed.Now their Butter Cake with Haagen Daaz ice cream deserves it's own paragraph. Oh my Goodness. I remember the first time being introduced to it, We wanted a dessert but didn't know which one to go with and our waitress was like, "You're not true CPK Fans till you've given our Butter Cake a try." This cake is life changing lmao. Super warm and soft and sweet but not too sweet. It's a little hard to describe the flavors but whatever you do, just get it.I've also ordered to-go many times and everytime, the pizza, salads, etc were all the same quality as you would get dining there. They're also really amazing at giving utensils, napkins, fresh bread, and parmesan/hot pepper flakes without even asking! Forever a regular!I think the last time I went to a California Pizza Kitchen was at least 4 years ago in Michigan! Surprisingly I haven't gone to the one in Town Square, however, that changed today. One of my girlfriends wanted to catch up with a light lunch and recommended we go here.We shared the Tortilla Spring Rolls as an app - you can choose from 3 different kinds and we got the Mediterranean Veggie and the Thai Chicken (Baja Chicken is the third choice). Three small portions of each came out with a marinara sauce for the veggie and a sweet peanut sauce for the thai spring rolls. They were both pretty tasty and a great way to start our lunch. I wanted a salad and went with the half portion of the Waldorf Chicken Salad and my friend got the half portion of the Moroccan Chicken Salad. The half portions are humongous and look like a full portion to me. Perfect size for lunch. My salad was incredibly delicious! Mixed greens with grapes, green apples, celery, chicken, candied walnuts, crumbled Gorgonzola, pre-tossed in a light vinaigrette. I wouldn't recommend getting this salad if you don't like Gorgonzola because as you know, it has a strong distinct taste and can be overpowering in any dish. I didn't mind at all because I LOVE cheese and Gorgonzola. Katie was our server and she was fantastic! Very friendly and checked up on us quite often to make sure we were enjoying everything and to refill our drinks.I'm very satisfied with my lunch today and would gladly go back! Highly recommend California Pizza Kitchen if you're in Town Square and craving a fresh salad. I'll have to try their pizza next time.You're getting average food for an inflated price...I usually know what to expect when I walk into certain restaurants and especially in certain locations - this is one of those restaurant and locations. CPK is generally overpriced for the portion of food you'll get. However, my previous experience has been that the quality of the food is decent. Well, it was marginal on this recent visit. Our Chinese Chicken Salad was $14.79 each and they were drenched in dressing. The salads were wilted messes. We were served some French bread with oil for our salad that was pretty good though.The service was pleasant.Being a strip location tucked in Town Square, I will forgive the "suggested gratuity" section on my check. Unfortunately, CPK makes their suggested-gratuity amount to include sales tax. Gratuity is based on food and beverage and therefore should be "suggested" (if necessary) based on the subtotal, before tax.I've been to this California Pizza Kitchen on a few different occasions and I'm usually left noticing that the food isn't as consistent with other locations and that the service is usually lacking. Slow with refills and last time we were there they forgot all about my to go box and I had to remind her to bring it back. Luckily she forgot it on a shelf near the cash register.

Took the Better Half to dinner here last week.  Located in the Hard Rock Hotel, it's a nice atmosphere to have dinner.  I like the house music they were playing in the restaurant....that might be a turnoff for some people.After browsing the menu for a few minutes, we decided to order:AppetizersRavioli Margherita (Fresh Made Cheese Ravioli, Cherry Tomato Sauce, Basil, $11.00) - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ov68TVizW1d2Hqm2M2FKVg?select=9ihYtt7ILkL-XN6LFW6S9gMozzarella Caprese ai Peperoni Dolci (Imported Buffalo Mozzarella, Tomato, Organic Sweet Peppers, Basil, $14.00)Entrees4 Formaggi al Salamino Pizza (4 Cheeses, Italian Salami, $14.00) - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ov68TVizW1d2Hqm2M2FKVg?select=Pho84hX78bz0TuxnvFpfGwDel Pastore Pizza (Spicy Sausage, Goat Cheese, Organic Peppers, $14.00) - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ov68TVizW1d2Hqm2M2FKVg?select=rfL6qYQHYYFeHS4eXlirzwEverything was really good.  I especially enjoyed the Ravioli appetizer and the 4 Formaggi Pizza....they were outstanding!  The other two dishes were pretty good too, but didn't stand out like the others.  Of course we enjoyed our meal with a few glasses of Sangiovese ($11 ea)....yum.Service here was great and it was a nice dinner during our Staycation.Return Factor - 80%

We used to go here all the time as a gang of ravenous undergraduates because BYO and a huge inexpensive mound of pasta within walking distance of your tiny crowded apartment just makes sense at that age. I hadn't been back in a while but Matt and Cindy's recent UYE (unofficial yelp event) brought me back and made me realize that inexpensive mounds of good food at a BYO never stops being a good idea, and is especially wise on Mondays. I ordered the Surf and Turf because at $24 this has to be one of the cheapest quality deals for steak, shrimp and pasta in town. The pasta was fresh and the sauce pure cream and butter goodness. The shrimp were really good, not fishy at all, and the steak was kind of amazing, super tender, juicy and perfectly medium rare in a light wine gravy.All in all a very satisfying yummy meal made better by the vines and stained glass and the exceptionally adorable company.

I was hopeful but it just wasn't that good.  I had the chicken pita (which they subtitle "shiwirma" on the menu) and steak sandwich.  Actually I shared them both.  And an order of fries.  And a piece of baklava.  Not balaclava.  Those taste fuzzy.So the chicken pita was ok, pretty much a three star kind of thing.  The steak sandwich was not as good.  It did not have enough meat or cheese and the bread was too heavy.  The meat was also not the best quality.The baklava was also only two star worthy.  Poor baklava is just a disappointment.  Skip it.Woah, holy shit, another place that sells Kronos Meat Cone products and calls itself the "best Gyros in town"... which, if true, means every other Gyro spot is also the best in town.  As Richard Christy would say, "It's mah faaavorite".  Food's good, quick service despite being hella-packed, I mean, line out the door packed.  The dude at the counter might have been mentally retarded... not like, drooling and slapping his chest retarded, but functionally retarded.  Anyway, $9 and some change gets you a huge plate of Kronos Meat Cone product, rice, salad, pita (or fries if you can get the mongoloid to understand your request), and a drink.

Lesson learned kids, listen to the almighty Yelpers.  They know what they're talkin' bout!I'd seen the good reviews and had read that other Yelpers got some tasty wings and burgers here.  Then why did I go for the risotto you ask??  I don't know, it looked good to me at the time, I'm sorry!  All the dinner items actually looked good.  My risotto...flavorless.  I needed pepper and salt desperately.  Too bad the server came around every 2 hours (I may be exaggerating a bit).  But the service was spotty.The saving grace was the enormous cheese plate we got as an app (good for AT LEAST 4 people) and the farfalle pasta with smoked gouda cream sauce my hubs got.  I quit my meal like a bad habit and ate most of his. That cheese sauce was divine!  And the cheese app had honey drizzled on top which really made the dish spectacular.  So 2 out of 3 dishes were winners.  I can accept that.The creativity just oozes out of this place.  It's a library type setting and as we sat down two big books were set in front of us.  I opened mine to find the menu.  How freakin' cute!  I looked over and noticed this large cook book sitting next to me and I thought "what the heck is that doing there?"  It was the other "menu" stuck in a cook book.  My book, I discovered, was about dragons.  Now I've eaten and learned about dragons.  Now that's multitasking!I absolutely want to go back for their $8 all you can eat wings to give them a try.  And Mel U is right, a Happy Hour special offered EVERY day is unheard of!  And pretty awesome!  Scarfin' down wings and drinkin' half price...I'm in!

This restaurant is just a pretty face with zero substance. Similar to an Australian male stripper I once met. Really nice to look at, but once he opened his mouth I couldn't run away fast enough. On to crappy Thai food.I walk in and am instantly taken back by how current and sharp this space is. They spent money in making it look appealing and it does! They were also playing some current American music which was unusual to me, but I liked it. Only one table was occupied by a couple when I placed my takeout order. The order taking was slightly awkward as I mentioned to the guy (because I am always entirely too friendly and can't help it. Unless I used expensive, yet bad moisturizer that is making my f*n face stink and the smell is killing me!), I mentioned that I have been dying to try this place.. He asked if I have ever had Thai food before. I wanted to ask him if he had ever brushed his teeth before. Again, I was nice about it. I placed my order for Panang chicken no rice and he then said," Medium or Mild". I responded with,"HOT". He gave me the look, but than wrote down my order. I paid and he said it would be a few minutes.....I don't mind waiting because I am in an especially good mood these days. The only couple in the restaurant pays and leaves. The music is turned off. The music never comes back on. I waited close to 30 minutes in silence for my order. I would have waited longer if I didn't get up and walk towards the kitchen. It had been sitting there for who knows how long. RUDE. I smile, grab my food and leave. Immediately I open the container upon walking in the door since I'm ravenous for some spicy curry. First impression- Panang sauce is really watery..... Second impression- Panang Chicken has tons of Thai chiles, but zero flavor other than heat. No basil or kaffir lime leaves. No complexity or richness to the sauce. Only pure coconut milk taste or lack of. Dinner fail. I really wanted to like this place and had hopes that this would be my new go to Thai spot for date night, but they just don't deliver on any level here. My suggestion is go anywhere else in the area for Thai unless you belong to a Coconut Milk Meetup Group or something. In that case knock yourself out. Literally.We were craving some Thai food but wanted to be "adventurous" and try something besides or usual neighborhood goto so I quickly browsed my bookmarked list and found Panna. I was hesitant at first because I heard their food was pretty Americanized but I'm glad we gave them a try.Called in and placed an order for pick up:Chicken satay entrée: comes with 6 nicely sized skewers of seasoned chicken, fried rice, salad and peanut sauce. Really good and nicely priced at around $12 a great shareable dish!Beef and asparagus: YUMMM the beef was so tender and the asparagus still had a nice crunch to it! Good brown sauce that was not too salty and MUSHROOMS!!! MmmmChicken Pad Thai: Meh. This was not good.. The noodles were way too soft and overcooked... the dish overall was too sweet. The 2 yummy dishes made us forget about the 1 meh dish.. Portion sizes and prices are good...We will definitely be back!Hot Tip: Togo containers are the plastic reusable kinds... WoopWoop!After my perinatal visit I decided I was really hungry. I wasn't sure what I was craving, but I knew this side of town had a vast amount of restaurants that I had been wanting to try. I consulted with Yelp and settled on Thai food. The restaurant was very spacious and clean and the host was welcoming. There was only one other table occupied as I came in at a weird "limbo" time of about 4pm. I ordered Thai coffee and Basil Noodles with seafood ($13.25) spicy level medium. I gotta say, pregnancy seems to have made me into a wuss when it comes to spicy food. Either that, or subconsciously I was not looking forward to the punishment that is severe heartburn. The portion was extremely generous, I would say enough for two people to share. I had them box up about half of it and had it for dinner little bit later. It may appear pricey to some, but it was an entree big enough to share. My total with tip was a little over $20..so not exactly cheap for one person, but as I said before, the portion and the quality justify the price. They did not skimp on the variety of seafood either. Their menu has a tapas section with many appetizing options. I am only giving them a four star because I want to try more of their menu before I decide it is emergerd the best thai food eva!There are enough items on their menu that I still want to try, so I will be back for sure.The BF regularly orders from here when he's at work. I get leftovers when he overorders- which isn't all that often, actually. The thai jerky and the crab fried rice are consistently good options, but I especially like combining the two. The dipping sauce for the jerky is awesome! They do have a $20 minimum for delivery.

Woooooooooo. The fact that Schwartz's in the #1 Montréal restaurant on Yelp in horrifying. C'mon guys. You might enjoy to wait 30 minutes for the taste of delicious fat smoked meat, dry rye bread and cherry cola, but Montréal has much more to offer than Schwartz's!!! We also have poutine. Just kidding.I would be really curious to see what is the ratio tourists/Montrealers there. No offense if you'd drive 7 hours from NY to eat their smoked meat: but I would personally not go out of my way for their stack of meat, not even on a sunny day. I might get killed for saying that.For a full discussion on the topic: Is Schwartz's overrated? http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/526634After reading the reviews here on Yelp, I felt prepared for my pilgrimage to Schwartz's. I turned up around 11:30 and was amazed there wasn't a line. Inside was plenty busy, but there were a few tables still open and seating at the counter. I squeezed into a seat here, between two gentlemen, and stared in amazement at the mountains of smoked meat waiting to be sliced for sandwiches--we're talking kilos and kilos of beef encrusted in Schwartz's special spices."Parlez-vous Anglais?" I asked the gentleman on my left. "Yes," was the reply in a suspiciously American accent. I then asked if the counter guy would come back to take my order, or if there was some arcane process that wasn't obvious. He said the guy would be back to take my order and we struck up a conversation. It turns out Tim was originally from Dallas, but had been living in Montreal for about 17 years. He was already halfway through his lunch of a medium-fat smoked meat sandwich and fries. He recommended I also order the medium-fat, as the lean is too dry and some don't like the full-fat version. I followed Tim's suggestion and ordered a med-fat.When it arrived, the sandwich was a little smaller than I'd anticipated. But then I had to remind myself I wasn't in the good ol' mega-sized U.S. of A. anymore--and it was too big for me to finish anyway. The smoked meat was piled thick between two slices of a white-type bread (not sourdough, and not rye) and garnished with a bit of plain yellow mustard. The meat tasted like corned beef but not as salty, and there was just a hint of smoke to it. Tim said that he's not really sure why it's called smoked meat, because it's primarily steamed. Regardless, it was good, but I think I would have preferred the full-fat cuts. I noticed that by the time I was nearing the end of my meal, the meat had cooled and had definitely become a bit dry.So, I'm glad I made it to this shrine to smoked meats, but I think once was enough to satisfy my curiosity. And my arteries thank me.I think I am banned from here.  Read on to find out why you should not be forced into the same situation yourself...I guess first off, I should mention that their food is really as good as other reviews claim it to be.  The meat literally melts in your mouth, fries are as good as they get and the pickle is what you would imagine the perfect pickle to be. All was good in da hood.  Service was initially very good.  But it all went downhill when my friend finished his can of Coke.  We waited until our waiter came around, then he asked "Sir, could I have another can of Coke please?"  The waiter replied no problem, right away... then 5 minutes goes by.  Then 10.  Then 15.  20 minutes, and the dude does not come back with my buddy's Coke.  We were pretty sure he forgot by then, so when he came around again, my friend asked him for the Coke again (not rudely, but very politely as before).Things started to go really sour from there... the guy started giving us the kind of screw face that only the old Eastern European dudes permanently carry around.  Then he muttered something in French, which we could kind of tell was an insult because the locals surrounding us started snickering.Another 5 minuets passes by until the Coke finally arrives... slammed on top of the table.  WTF?  Why so much attitude buddy?So by this time, we are pretty much done our meal.. we grab the can of Coke to go, and ask for the cheque.  Even though we waited 20 minutes for Coke, we receive this promptly.  The awesome part?  He followed by two finger taps on the table, with instructions to "leave the tip here."Hahahaha!!  I could not believe this guy!  I've seen some guys with big balls, but this guy has the biggest balls of all time!  You want me to leave you tip?  I have never in my life had anyone ask for tip before.. never mind by someone who gave us kiss my ass service.  So after having a chuckle at his face, I grabbed the cheque and paid the cashier.Then we hit the sidewalks and started walking to our cars... out of no where, we start hearing some angry French speaking dude yelling at us.  We turned around, and sure it enough it is Mr. Big Balls himself.  When he had caught up with us, he had a copy of the cheque in his hand, and was doing math to figure out how much we should tip him.My friend and look at each other and started bursting out laughing.  We turned around and kept on walking, while LOLing non-stop... and of course, we heard lots of follow up French cursing from the angry man.Hey if the owners are reading this... control your people.  Your establishment is legendary, no argument there.  But your staff have that soup Nazi attitude because of your popularity.  And how ironic is that?Schwartz's Deli is a surprising Montreal institution, as the only thing that's obviously Canadian is their location at the heart of Saint-Laurent. Stepping inside here is like stepping into a timewarp: memorabilia cover the walls, vintage stools stand polished, and piles of meat stare right back at you, as if they're preparing you psychologically for what's to come. Yes, this is a tourist attraction, but it's a delicious one. The queue moves fast thanks to their cash-only communal seating friendly but no-nonsense customer service strategies.Try their signature smoked meat sandwich (medium cut) and throw in a huge ass dill pickle (hello ladies). The whole shebang is only about C$7! Their meat isn't the most moist - this isn't life-changing stuff - but you'll be in and out of there so fast you won't care.The smoked meat is better than Katz's! I didn't think it was possible. Ordered "fatty," you will never get closer to heaven. It's so soft and salty, and the bread is nice and soft too. For $6.15... wait, 6 bucks??? NY is a killer on the wallet, it's bullshit that I am even GLAD to pay 15 for a pastrami at Katz's.  Now I have some perspective and want to move to Montreal. From across the street, I looked at the line out the door, and didn't want to go - no matter how good it is, I'm not going to wait in line like a bunch of lemmings for a sandwich. THEN, I found that there is a take-out shop next door selling the exact same sandwich - and there's even tables and counters to sit at!  Zero line. How come no one told me about this before???I have no idea what the classic Schwartz's deli looks like, and I don't care. Schwartz's take-out window gets 5 stars - easily. It blows up the scale.We have had lunch at Schwartz's every time we come to Montréal.  There's always a bit of a wait, but people are friendly and we're generally seated pretty fast.  There are a series of communal tables of 8.  It's not a place where you linger over your meal.  People order, eat and go.  We shared our table today w/ a couple of guys from Vancouver, a professional soccer coach and the team trainer/doctor.  They were nice guys.  Another couple at the other end of the table ate quickly enough that we didn't even find out where they were from.We each ordered a smoked meat sandwich, Schwartz's specialty.  You have a choice of lean, medium or fat.  We chose medium.  Lean is reportedly too dry.  We overheard our server explain to someone that today's fat used to be medium 15 years ago, but cattle are being bred leaner these days, so they're unable to obtain the level of fat they used to.  We also ordered fries to share.  The fries came first.  There were fewer of them than at Steak Frites and they were much, much better.  The sandwiches were excellent, w/ rye bread that was on the small side and the smoked meat piled high.  It was a manageable portion and oh so tasty.There are two bathrooms for the entire restaurant, one for men and one for women.  They are basic and clean.  You pay up front at the cashier.  Alan was out of Canadian money and only had a $20.  He paid for our lunch and got change but was unable to fight his way back through the crowd, which had grown pretty thick, to tip the server.  We felt bad about that, because he'd been friendly, patient and helpful.  It was difficult even to get out the door.  It's a popular place.We all need a slump buster every so often and something to break one out of a rut. For me, there are not many things that get me more excited than talking about meat. To end my dry spell, I could think of no place better to write about than Schwartz's.On a recent trip to Montreal this spring, Schwartz's was the place that I made sure to stop by.  Founded in 1928, Schwartz's is a Montreal institution and is best known for their beloved smoked meat or viande fumee as the locals call it.  Whatever you call it, smoked meat is just plain delicious.  Unlike pastrami which has a distinct sweeter taste, smoked meat is brisket cured heavily with spices such as cracked peppercorns and coriander.  For me fat equals flavor, so I selected my smoked meat served medium which was the perfect combination of lean & fat cut from the middle of the brisket.  Served between 2 slices of rye bread slathered with mustard, this was the perfect late breakfast on a cold Montreal morning.  If you plan to visit Schwartz's, keep in mind that this is a small place & does get very crowded with both locals and tourists alike. Unless you plan on taking a taxi here, Schwartz's is also about a 5-10 minute walk from the Sherbrooke Metro station.  Another interesting fact about Schwartz's is that they were recently purchased by a group that includes singer Celine Dion.  Being an old school eatery, I really do hope that they do not change anything as this is truly part of the Montreal experience and was one of the culinary highlights of my trip.I found this place hearing it's the best place to get smoked meat in montreal. and it IS!! Came around 8pm on a monday and there was a very long line up, so we came back the next day on Canada's day around 12 and there was no line up- amazing! Inside is packed with people, and it smells great. Looks like a diner, the walls are filled with newspapers and articles about their great reputation. The blue jays have even signed for them.Had the classic medium smoked meat burger. Best meat sandwich I ever had in my life. Thick meat smothered in mustard on rye bread, the meat is to dye for. There's a lot of it though, but the best part is the crust. The meat is extremely flavourful, juicy, and tender. You see why they're in business for so long. Waiter recommended medium, but I think next time I would order lean instead, there was a lot of fat in the medium one. It's weird because my friend also got medium but was leaner than my cut.They are quick to serve and they want you out of there because they gave us the bill when I wasn't done eating. Great guys though, and I would come back again if I have the chance!I'm not a big fan of smoked meat, but everyone who has come here with me has LOVED the smoked meat sandwiches. IF you don't want to wait in line and don't mind taking to go - just walk go their takeout area (store on the left).Recommendation: 110%.Schwartz's is the gold standard for being the best at what you do.  They haven't changed a thing in decades, because it's perfect.While they have a menu, you just go for the smoked meat.  I like to get the platter of medium (fattiness that is), a stack of rye slices, some mustard, and just devour one sandwich after the next.  Along the way, have some fries with vinegar and pickles, and then wash it down with a black cherry soda.You may have to wait a little while in line and eat with other people at your table, but it's all part of sharing the experience.Pour un smoke-meat aficionados tel que moi, impossible de ne pas écrire quelques lignes à propos de Schwartz's. Donc... c'est sans trop d'enthousiasme que j'accorde 3 étoiles à cette " institution " montréalaise. Une note correcte, sans plus. Voici pourquoi :Oui, la viande ici est bonne, mais ce n'est pas la meilleure que j'ai goutée. La viande maigre (il faut dire " lean " car certains serveurs anglophones feront semblant de ne pas vous comprendre) est trop sec, il faut donc commander la régulière pour vraiment gouter un bon sandwich. Pour le reste, Schwartz's est un petit resto à l'ambiance médiocre. À l'intérieur, tout dégage une odeur de gras et de friture. Les tables sont minuscules, les chaises inconfortables, le service est " garoché ", l'ambiance est bruyante sans être vivante ou sympathique. On vous incite à manger vite et à déguerpir dès la facture arrivée à table. Ce que je trouve dommage, c'est de voir à chaque été cette longue file de touristes, un petit guide de Montréal à la main, attendant patiemment d'avoir une table. Triste oui, car malheureusement pour nous les montréalais, les guides tels que Lonely Planet (ou autres) imposent Schwartz's comme la porte d'entrée " culinaire " de Montréal, alors que bien d'autres restos méritent l'attention des touristes, qu'ils servent du smoke-meat ou non.Je le dirais toujours à nos amis touristes : vous désirez manger un bon sandwich smoke-meat et vivre une vraie belle expérience de resto de quartier à la montréalaise ? Alors quitter cette longue file d'attente et rendez-vous chez Lester sur la rue Bernard. La viande est aussi bonne sinon meilleure et l'ambiance est franchement plus authentique. Vous avez une voiture et vous êtes prêts à sortir de Montréal ? Alors prenez l'autoroute 720 direct Ouest et roulez jusqu'à île Perrot (30 minutes sans embouteillage).  Une fois passé le pont de l'autoroute du souvenir après Ste-Anne de Bellevue, vous verrez un resto au toit rouge nommé Smoke-Meat Pete. Un autre endroit que je conseil fortement.

Review NoirIt was one of those nights when every drinking party ends in a fight.  A desert wind was blowing through the streets that night.  It was a hot wind that pulled insistently at your clothes and made the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  The streets were quieter than a dead cat under the guardrail aside a moonlit mountain road.I was wearing my olive drab shorts and a black "Kill Your Television" t-shirt, I was sober and I didn't care who knew it.  I was everything an after-work regional manager ought to be and I was calling on Best of Italy.  She was exacting, charming and ruthless in the size of her slices.  I was feeling like a kid that likes to pull the legs off of spiders.  No more sense of morals than a downtrodden puppy.She's a grifter, a voice barked from the back of my mind.  Maybe she is, I thought, but what does this five-dollar special want?  Behind the flash, behind the smile, was there nothing but poison under that sauce?  I had to know, even if it meant the big sleep by morning.I tried her slices and they were good.  No, they were more than good and held that inner truth.  You know the truth I'm talkin' about.  The truth that makes you aware of just how aware you are. You know the world belongs to men like you, men who act as if it's a right to great pizza.  Pizza like this.  The truth that tells you the world would be a better place and not too dull to live in if there were more pizza like this around.  Because you're a part of it now, see?  The crust and the sauce and the cheese and the toppings...they're in you now and you can't go back.Apparently there is a burly sasquatch with a gun in the back that forces the owner to stay open past 2am on saturdays, even though the hours are only til 2.  I know this because I was there and that was one cranky owner.If you would like miserable crankiness and horrifyingly bad service, I invite you to go to this place anytime and chat up the charming owner. To their credit, the employees are not the owner. If they were, I would want to punch them too. Pizza: decent. Actually pretty good. Not good enough to weather the one-man storm of discontent. Don't go there.If you want to be yelled at for trying to get a bite to eat late night, come on over to "Best of Italy" where the motto is "Treat the customers like shit and make them suffer for all of our bad life choices"I understand that we popped into your pizza shop (located at the mecca of late night drinking - S Scottsdale) later than you wanted to be there, but you kept the door open, the open sign on and agreed to serve us and the other people in there pizza, so I don't want to hear how you have "been here since 9am."I literally got yelled at by the owner for trying to spend my money at this place, and the $3 I paid for the cold, lifeless pizza was $3 too much because it was awful, had obviously just been hanging around for hours and literally made me feel like I was digesting razor blades.Do yourself a favor and hit up Denny's or Philladelphia Sandwich Company instead... they may not serve pizza but I'm certain that they appreciate your business and won't treat you like crap.

Flying makes me hungry. Actually life makes me hungry, but flying makes me extra hungry.  It's hard work sitting on that plane for 4 hours! So as soon as I landed in Phoenix last night I was ready for some grub. Gabi K picked me up from the airport and took me straight to Julio's Too to meet some of her friends for dinner. When we arrived there was a basket of chips and lots of salsa waiting for us...thanks Julio!  As I filled up on chips I checked out the menu and was torn between the shrimp fajitas and fish tacos.  I decided on the shrimp tacos (as did Gabi) and soon we were greeted with LOTS of food. We probably should have shared, but like I said before...flying makes me hungry.  I've had better fajitas in my life, but they were tasty and VERY filling.Of course I managed to eat much more than one of Gabi's friends who's 4 months pregno, but I'll blame my piggyness on the flying.If you're looking for a great mexican restaurant, then there are other places to go than this one. But if its for something to fill a hungry stomach or just wants to eat in a simple place, then this is the right spot. Food is good and quite affordable too. You can't go wrong with this one. But like I said, if its something great that you are looking for, then you're better off going to some place much better (or expensive) than this.

Restaurant name  The Paiza Club
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
This is an exclusive club where high rollers, primarily aimed at the Chinese clientele, can eat, drink, and gamble.  It is the secret dining/gambling club in Vegas.  You can only get in with large deposit and/or a word from your handler/host with a reservation.  You can only get up there with a special elevator card key as well.  Once you arrive, there's special doors without signs or any indication of the place.  When you finally walk in there's a simple counter with a host waiting to accept your reservations.Once inside, this plush but not overly fancy area features a lounge area, a gambling area, and a few private rooms for dining.  I was told that the dining and kitchen is open 24 hours a day.  You can order anything from the menu at all hours.  The menu is primarily Cantonese cuisine.  The food was some of the best Cantonese Chinese I had ever had.  On top of that, there is a great liquor selection, at no charge - including some fine single malt scotches.  I was told that the Macau equivalent - Paiza Club is 4 or 5 times larger than the Las Vegas one.  I assume that there are more high rollers out there.  I was fortunate enough to have dinner at The Paiza with some friends.The Paiza club in the Palazzo on the 50th floor is as good as it gets. We had a private room for dining and had the option of ordering anything, as long as it was Asian food, on and off the menu. I wanted some eggs and they provided it, done with a 5 star flare. I asked for Vietnamese Pho and they provided that as well, which amazed the hell outta me because I thought Pho stew had to be made 12 hours in advance. We asked for Johnny Walker Blue Label and it was brought to our table. As a matter of fact, we asked for bottles of the stuff and they gladly obliged, leaving it there and asking if they should pour it or if we will. The orange juice was fresh squeezed as it was ordered. Luckily for them, I didn't want apple or watermelon juice. I would quote some prices but I can't remember any. I just recall the Blue Label in the price range of $450-550. Some of the entrees were up in the hundreds. Pros: Everything. The service. The food. The shark fin soup that I thought was noodles. Cons: None. But if we had to pay for it then the con would be the price. Other thoughts: I will be rich one day just so I can enjoy this type of lavish living all the time. But then again, I'd probably die early if I lived like this all the time. Too rich for my blood. Pun intended.

Review Text :
I think I'm going to cry. After over TEN YEARS of suffering through Arizona style sandwiches... Long Island is finally in the house! The first thing I saw when I walked in was the potato salad... and I knew I was home. Long Island delis have a certain way of making potato salad that I've never found anywhere else in the world. So when I saw The Hero Factory's deli case my heart started to race a little. I prayed to God that his would be the real deal. By the power of Huntington please be an authentic LI deli run by real New Yorkers.And it is!!!Ever since I moved here from New York I've been craving a real deli sandwich. That means tons of boarshead meat on a real roll (kaiser or hero) with dressing and shredded lettuce. Chicken parm, turkey and cheese, roast beef with mustard - it doesn't matter just make it taste like home. Thankfully everything I ate at The Hero Factory tasted exactly like home. Even if you are not from NY, you must give this place a try. They make the best heros in the Valley - hands down. You will fall in love.The owners did a really great job of maintaining authenticity. Their accents, personality and friendly, familiar way of talking to the customers is refreshing and so very NY. I actually feel like something good happened to me today because I discovered this place. I'll be back whenever I have a craving for good food or for home.In short, this tiny downtown sub shop serves affordable breakfast and big hero sandwiches. No vegan options though, but they have vegetarian breakfast items.I've only eaten here in the morning and usually order the garden platter which came with potatoes and coffee for under $6.I wish they'd serve tofu scrambles, but they are not that kind of restaurant.The place is clean and breakfast items are inexpensive and decent. I can't really comment about the other items though. Overall rating + 3.5I've heard about the Hero Factory for years but never had the chance to try their sandwiches until today. While waiting in the 4 hour line to redeem our Jimmy Fallon tickets, our friends were kind enough to give my pregnant self a break and let me grab a sandwich while they held our spot in line. The Hero Factory truly lived up to their name because their sandwiches were incredible and they were the closely spot open to the Orpheum. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and my husband had the Eddie Machete. Both sandwiches were amazing but I especially loved my husband's which had chicken, bacon, cheese and this amazing chipotle mayo. I wish I lived closer to the Hero Factory so I could enjoy their sandwiches more. The guys working there were super nice and friendly. If you're in Downtown Phoenix, stop by for a sandwich and you won't be disappointed!!

Restaurant name  Thai House

Review Text :
Damn... Helen Y beat me to the punch and got the FTR for this place!  Oh well, I will say that she did a great job with her review - I think I was Thai in a past life; I swear, I could eat Thai food every night and be happy.  I was having a usual Thai food craving, so I popped into Thai House this evening and ordered the spicy eggplant dish (add extra veggies and tofu) - medium spice + brown rice to go.  (Yes, they have brown rice!)  I was totally blown away by how great  my dinner was!The sauce was just spicy enough, the tofu firm, and the veggies flavorful.  I was impressed that the order was filled with big chunks of luscious eggplant (I really love eggplant), but since I had them add extra veggies, it came with spinach, mushrooms, cabbage, broccoli, carrots, onions, and peppers too.  My total was $11.82, and I had the best dinner I've had in a long while.  I probably could've had enough leftover for lunch tomorrow, but it was so good, i ate it all!I can't wait to go back to Thai House to try some of the other menu items soon!  If you're looking for good Thai food in Scottsdale, give Thai House a shot!This restaurant has been open for about 7 months in my old 'hood in Scottsdale in the Sonora shopping mall off the 101 and FLW between the Best Buy and Staples. The restuarant has a sister location in Mesa.The owners are Thai. The decor is clean, neat, almost quaint, and without a lot of Thai decorative influences. They do play a sort of Ttradional Thai melodies meets New Age Relaxation type CD, and it is relaxing. I came for lunch. They run 10 lunch specials for $6.95, which includes a side salad of romaine and carrot strips with a light soy/sesame dressing. To satisfy the mostly Caucasian Scottsdale neighborhood, the choices are part Chinese (Orange Chicken, Kung Pao), Japanese (Chicken Teriyaki) and Thai (Pad Thai, Panang).I had Panang Chicken curry, which came with your choice of fried or steamed rice (steamed Jasmine). The curry comes in your preferred spice level from 1 to 5. Pick 3, which is about right for most. The curry had a nice flavor, with nice small pieces of chicken with juliened red bell peppers. I added a Thai iced tea to drink for $2. They have the usual colors of curries, all about $10, soups like Tom Yum Koong, Salads like Yum Woon Sen, Larb, and Papaya, and noodles like Pad Thai, Pad Se Ew, and Rad Nar. A bit Americanized, but tasty and very reasonable. There are few choices for Thai in Scottsdale, so if you have craving, try this one.7/26/12If you're looking for atmosphere, you won't find it here.  It's also very loud (I went during lunch hours), and you're most likely going to have to wait, unless you come during the tail-end of lunch.  (There's a sign posted on the wall by the door that stated to the effect that for those customers who did not want to or could not wait, then please visit Narai Thai and Sushi down a few doors.  To some people, it might come off as abrupt, and even slightly rude, but I thought that was generous of Thai House to post...  Both places are good, and Narai Thai has atmosphere.)   What you will find are a great Chicken panang http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JdtJ3jmMukLXU-gDjVTEgg?select=UMYl4OVwixbiNkHhZM1P2Q#x0sI8WU7hgYveO5nGEFk1A and a terrific bowl of Curry noodles!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JdtJ3jmMukLXU-gDjVTEgg?select=UMYl4OVwixbiNkHhZM1P2Q#RDHeNq9Ld9h5-6imL9WDRg  The curries here are rich and very silky-- just how I prefer them!  The Thai iced tea I had was also very, very good (not too sweet).  What I didn't like was that the lunch specials only featured the entree and your choice of soup/salad and steamed white/fried rice.  No egg roll.  Probably a healthier option, but still... :(  I didn't care for the salad dressing, a sweet vinaigrette.  Next time, I'm going to specify dry.  What really sealed the deal here for me was the service!  I cannot wait to go back and try the other menu items!Finally a good Thai joint.  The place is super casual but the dishes are tasty.  Try their signature spicy red curry catfish entree.  Everything else is quite good so come and get your Thai food here.  They have decent portions and prices but I noticed they don't offer much pork options.

Review Text :
Wow, I can't believe how bad the food was here. Tried to come here late night at 2:45 am, but they turned us away cuz they closed at 3 am.Fine. So, we went back a day later to nurse out bangin hangovers. I was so excited to try this place, but what a mother effin letdown.*shakes head*Ordered the steamed pork dumplings (xiao long bao), steamed shrimp dumplings, noodle soup with pork and pickled veggies (Taiwanese staple), and filet mignon pho tai.Har gow- eh, it was decent. 4 pieces. typical dim sum fare.Steamed pork dumplings- omg, what a disgrace to even call this that name. I had 1 piece and was thoroughly offended. He had a piece and made the funniest this-is-gross face. We left the last piece untouched. My noodle soup with pork and picked veggies was so bland and tasteless that I just couldnt eat it after a few bites. Instead I ordered beef noodle soup. Beef noodle soup came to the table 5 min later. Holy shit. It was freakin spicy as hell! I thought I was gonna die. They had added 10 red peppers in there. Not kidding. My mouth, throat, tummy, and ass was on fire. I'm really ticked off that they didn't indicate the spicy factor on the menu. It took me at least 30 min or more to get through half the dish.My DC had the pho tai and said it was awesome. I only had some broth, so I can't comment on it. Anyways, this place is not recommended. The bill was about $81, which included a thai iced tea, vietnamese iced coffee and hot tea. Hells no. Never again.3.5 stars for me.I agree with what many say that the place is overpriced, but we clearly had a better lunch than many.  Don't know if they're inconsistent, or if we just ordered better?  Here's what we had:-Shanghainese Pork Dumpling: A pretty basic dish that is hard to do badly.  The dumplings did take a while to come out (we were told this in advance), suggesting that they are fresh.  They were freshly steamed and pretty good.-Cantonese Roast Duck: This dish was small but very tasty.  The duck was nicely cooked, and the skin was flavorful and crispy.  Enjoyed this.-Satay Ox Tail Noodle Soup: Our waitress was very pleased that we both knew what ox tail was and that we liked it.  Apparently most of the whiteys that go there don't.  Living in LA, we eat everything!  This was super interesting.  Viet-style  Pho, with Thai-style satay base, with Chinese-style ox tail.  It says it's spicy and I'm sure it is for some.  I wanted it hotter, so we doctored it with some of the sauces on the table.  I enjoyed this dish a lot.  Great mix of flavors!-Singapore Style Curry Rice Vermicelli: Again, good flavors and interesting mix.  We enjoyed this too!Overall we enjoyed our meal but, admittedly, it was expensive.  I was also mildly annoyed that I needed to leave the restaurant to use the restroom; for this price, but a restroom in your place like all the other medium-upscale places!  Service was good and we were stuffed full of bold flavors.Since I come here fairly often, I figured a running list of dishes would be the most help I can give. This place is consistent with food, but I understand the price has really scared off people. That's the thing with Chinese food is that often times even if it's cooked well done, we have a mentality it is "cheap food" and again, this is a expensive casino and is a nice dining place and it's not like their prices aren't posted on online menus. Some dishes are not worth getting at the price they need to charge to be inside a expensive casino property but some are fantastic. If the basics or Americanized favorites are what you want or you are rather frugal of a traveler then do yourself a favor and go up Spring Mtn for half the price. Otherwise, if you like a nice ambiance and nice quality over thrift then read on. I guess this review is gonna be the most useful for tourists than locals. Granted I get special hookups of sorts now which makes it more affordable for me but even so I would pay for my favorite sea bass fish dish at full price. One way to get savings is they actually have a Happy Hour! It's half off all the appetizers (you can see menu online)  and beers! It's 3pm-6pm Mon-Fri, and 10pm-1am Sun- Thurs. They also do lunch specials Mon-Fri until 3pm for $15 which is a soup, entree, and mochi ice cream. Best dish - baked Chilean Sea Bass. It's a rather good portion for the $32 that is shareable, 2-3 filets of fish. It's baked in a sweetish glaze and on a bed of zucchini, tofu, whole roasted garlic, mushrooms in a light sweet and tangy sauce. Its one of my favorite fish dishes ever.Best surprise- the pho. It actually is some of the best pho I've had as the ingredients are top notch fresh but the broth balance is lovely. It is double the price, but if you're going to pick having pho here or at that place in TI and don't want to go up to Spring Mtn to get off strip prices, just come here instead as this one is rather good. Other stuff I've tried: Crispy pan fried noodles - Had it with various toppings but my favorite was the seafood one. Really good, fresh and plentiful with seafood. Other meats are good too, but it's standard. E-fu w/ crab - one of my favorites. E-fu is a soft braised noodle and is every bit my comfort food Chinese dish. I loved e-fu as a child and still do. The crab in this is fresh and the portion is hard to finish. I order this very often.Rice vermicelli noodle with shredded duck and pickled cabbage - I like this as well, better if you ask for some hot mustard to mix into as it adds the right amount of omph to it. It is a subtle dish and normally not a fan of vermicelli (except pho) but I love the sauce that is in this and the combo of pickled cabbage in it. This is also something we order a lot. Curry Crab- really messy, but a awesome tangy and fragrant curry. It probably takes away from the dish a bit to do the curry on the side, but seriously was hard to crack shells covered in sauce no matter how delicious it was. Seared Scallop with Schzuan Pepper Sauce- the sauce is good and they do give you plentiful big scallops but they were cut in half thinner and well cooked which I don't prefer so I haven't ordered again. I may ask whole piece and not well done. Shredded Pork and Thousand Year Congee- pretty good congee. I know thats a very plain and subtle thing, but a sign is it didn't really need soy in it. It was well seasoned on its own. Yang Chow Fried Rice - it's bb pork and shrimp fried rice. Pretty good and flavorful, no need for any seasoning, except I do love hot sauce on my rice. Cha Gio- they were decent viet style egg rolls, but not my favorite. Also I was missing the plentiful herbs, It just came with lettuce and nuoc nam. Macau style pork belly- the portion isn't very huge, but it's perfectly cooked. Crispy skin, melty fat and juicy meat. Spicy Chili Wonton - nice fresh made wontons in spicy oil and sauce. Pretty good as far as dim sum go. Spring Onion Pancake- theirs is good, crisp and comes piping hot fresh. Black bean sauce pork ribs - one of my favorite dimsum and theirs here is really tender. Shrimp har gao- good, but standard. Same goes for the Shumai. Red bean pastry with vanilla ice cream - it's basically like spring onion pancakes except with red bean instead. A pretty good dessert with a bit of vanilla and chocolate sauce. Service here has never been bad, it's always in a acceptable range of good to really good depending on who we get. There's a few people we prefer having, that has been here a while and are ninja intuitive with diners needs. I'll keep adding to this list as I dine here.The Service: Okay... took the order fast. Serve the food fast. But our server never checked on us after that.... Not attentive. The Food: SUPER OVERPRICED Chinese food. Since it is at the Palazo Hotel so it is expected.Fish porridge - Lots of rice..... only a few pieces of fish for $19!!!! So not worth it. Not much flavor too. Very disappointed.

Review Text :
It's a buffet so honestly I don't think I could ever give it 5 stars.   They had a very good variety, about 6-8 entrees, about 4 sides, a small salad bar and a small desert bar. The flavors were pretty solid. The biggest problem was that most of the entree items had dried out, and it was only 12 noon.   If they had plastic covers or covered the meat items with sauces it would have been much, much better.The starter item of plantains were good, but a little sweet for me.  I didn't finish them.Not bad and I might go back but if I'm going to a buffet I'd rather stick to my Indian buffets.I went to April Office hours at Drip on Thursday and really enjoyed getting to know some of the people that populate the Yelp community. One of the things I like about Yelp is that people actually get together to talk about food, culture, art, etc. I spend way too much of my life with my head buried in a monitor, dealing with electro-mail and what not:)So, given the crowd at Office Hours, it probably isn't incredibly surprising that after Office Hours, we decided that we had better get something to eat...I need my 7 square meals a day or I get cranky...low blood sugar:)I set out for Sabor Cubano, with Mr. K and Brian S. (as agreeable a pair of lunch companions as there are:).I had never been to Cuban Flavor, although I am big fan of Cuban food (and cuban cigars, but no,no,no,no, I don't smoke them no more...I've been following Jim W's song title thread:). I like Havana Café (a review for another day), but I had not had some of the "down home" or "en casa" Cuban food that we got at Sabor Cubano.I can take or leave buffets, as general rule (I think "sneeze guard" is just a suggestion, in the buffet line, frankly...I have seen far too many people with their head under the Plexiglas, trying to get that last pickle or radish to be comfortable that it keeps much in the way of disease out of the food:). For you non-buffet types, Sabor Cubano has table service, Cuban specials (sandwiches, beef dishes, etc.).But "danger" is my middle name and the lunch buffet was truly delightful. I got to sample so many cubano dishes that I hadn't tried before. They had navy beans and ham, with giant ham hocks sitting in the beans in the hot table...delightful:) ; they had 3 different types of chicken on the bone, all seasoned and prepared differently and all delicious. There were spicy black beans and red beans, several different kinds of rice, potatoes that really complemented one of the chicken dishes.Chicken Croquettes, Beef, fish, and vegetables and soup, all cooked in a Cuban style completed the hot offerings. Everything was well prepared, and nothing was dried out and tired (something you see in buffets on a pretty constant basis).The salad bar was clean and the vegetables fresh, and the desert bar had custard and a rice pudding that looked great and authentic (I didn't have desert...I am trying to watch my figure:)A very solid offering for under $10, including drinks. It didn't hurt that we had some great conversation and few laughs during lunch, too! Sabor Cubano stays in the rotation:)Brian and Mr. K, thanks again for pointing me south to Cuba! (or was it northwest?).

Possibly my favorite dish ever...I would never do this dish justice by attempting to describe it but all I can say is that I've never had anything like it before and whenever friends ask me where to eat I can't help but to bring this place up just for this dish alone! You can pick any fish you'd like & it's cooked in a banana leaf with coconut milk, potatoes and bananas. The aroma alone might cause you to make a sound that isn't appropriate at any restaurant :) Amazingness doesn't begin to describe the dish. I could eat it every day, all day for the rest of my life. For this dish alone I have to give this place 5 stars. As for everything else, it's ok, nothing spectacular. The restaurant itself is very dated and desperately needs a facelift. It overlooks the lake which is probably beautiful during the day but at night you can't see any of it. All the other dishes including the sushi are overpriced & good but again nothing amazing. I drive from Summerlin for this one fish dish cooked in a banana leaf which is crazy but every bite of it is so worth it! I will be back just to order my favorite thing ever over & over again.

Restaurant name  Asia

Review Text :
Listed by Get Out Mag as a hip noodle house (formally called sN Asian Kitchen), Asia is said to have a cool black/white/red decor motif with a sushi bar. The restaurant - described as cozy - features noodle dishes from Japan, China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. Also, there's live jazz music Friday and Saturday nights. So, ask yourself: Would that tempt you? It certainly did me, and at 7 p.m. on a Saturday, my sushi-lovin' friend and I met here. We were immediately shown to a corner booth and given menus. Our server was friendly, albeit a tad eccentric, which we didn't mind. Her quick, matter-of-fact manner was something we couldn't decide if we liked. But, that's okay. Our first challenge was to pick out our drinks. The wine list is HUGE. There's also specials they write on a big chalk board. Narrowing it down to a few selections took a few minutes... and my friend was disappointed to be told twice that they were out of the drink of her choice (including one of the sakes on the menu). Bummer. I went with the J Lohr Wildflower red blend. And I didn't like it. I told our server that I should have taken her suggestion and gotten the Writer's Block Zin and I was hoping I could send back the Wildflower. "You don't like it?""No, sorry. I don't.""That's okay. I hate it. It's so popular, though. I don't understand why."Uhm, good to know. For being honest about other wines, she certainly held her tongue when I placed my order. My friend and I split the Salmon Salad app, with fresh spinach and pine nuts. It was very tasty. The Salmon was tempura, but I didn't find it too fried to enjoy. We then shared the Best of Asia - 3 pieces each of yellow tail, tuna and salmon, lightly seared and flavored with garlic, paprika, ponzu and a jalapeno on top. HOT! I had two pieces and left the rest for my friend. The Big Buddha Roll, which we shared, was very, very tasty. It was a little spicy, but in that good way I enjoy. This roll was double wrapped with soy paper on the outside and had crab meat, avocado, cream cheese and salmon inside. YUM! About 3/4 of our way through dinner, the server brought out my new glass of wine. Uhm, ok. "Sorry, I totally forget.""But at least you remember," my friend remarked. As for the atmosphere, it can only be summed up this way: Airport. I got the feeling that if I walked out the front doors, I'd be inside an airport terminal, headed to whatever gate I needed to be at to make my flight. The interior of the place, like my friend pointed out, seemed to be the type of place that "you cram things inside a space that don't really fit or belong." Bingo! The sushi bar/kitchen takes up the bulk of the space, with a short sushi bar area to its immediate side. There's a few tables scattered about, as well as a few booths. The decor is red, black and white - Get Out was right about that. I just would never call this place cozy. They did turn down the lighting around 7:30 which helped immensely. As for the music, it was nice jazz. The trio set up in a corner and played a few songs. Sax, drums, guitar - what else do you need? On our way out, while the band was on break, we learned they weren't even a band... and that they just kind of set up and played in an impromptu style. Regardless, they were enjoyable. They didn't really fit the motif of the restaurant, tho. It was more of the "airport restaurant trying to be a cool lounge with live music."When the bill came, I was pleased to see our server did not charge me for the glass of wine I sent back. I appreciated that. Yet, the bill was a bit too high for the type of service/experience my friend and I had here at Asia. $46 for 2 people? Ouch. Both the Buddha Roll and Best of Asia were $12 a piece (the former totally worth it; the latter not). The appetizer salad was $8. My friend's sake was $2 (bargain) and my glass of really great Zin (a new fave) was $9. All in all, it added up. But I definitely would not go back to throw down that kind of money at a place that reminded me of an airport restaurant. Also, while we were waiting for the server to run my card, I flicked with my forefinger what I thought was a piece of paper, though in my mind it looked like a tiny, tiny fly. Turns out the "piece of paper" sprouted legs and started to crawl across the table. IT WAS A BUG! Ew. Gross. This place has potential, but it'll need a real overhaul to entice me to come back. Redeeming traits:*HUGE wine list (almost too big; it's hard to decide)*Full bar with beer selections, including a couple Asian favorites*Sake choices for cheap*Big Buddha Roll that's one of the best rolls I've had - anywhere*Live music - sure beats pop music blasting overhead*Clean bathroom with a vibrant green scheme - with several men's magazines to flip through (Weird, eh?) and a pic of Audrey Hepburn on the wall

Review Text :
I had one of the best St. Patties Days of my life here. The place was completely packed and full of fun friendly folks. Do yourself a favor and try Temple real soon (I prefer Friday, Saturday or Sunday night).Two stars for Temple should be extreme flattery.I just want to remind everyone that as of Tuesday night, we are still in a recession. People are looking for work, companies are going out of business left and right, middle class families are living on the street. What does this mean, you ask?Well, it means if I come into your eating and drinking establishment with fifteen others, you should be excited that your damn bar is getting business and that you will walk out with some cash in your pocket.Is that what happened? NoWe got terrible service. Our waitress was really snappy and rude, complaining before we even sat down about splitting checks. She took a few orders first and then came back later to take the rest while informing us that they were no longer serving food. If she would have said that in the beginning, maybe everyone would have had a chance to order before the kitchen closed.The "smothered" tater tots were basically just sprinkled with cheese.  This was a huge disappointment because I love cheese.The only redeeming thing about this place was the fact that they had good reverse happy hour specials.Temple - if you want repeat customers, treat them a little better. Especially since you are in WAY northeast Scottsdale and people are not just going to accidentally run into you.I lived down the street from this place for almost two years before I even heard about it. I shouldn't have admitted that to you because now my credibility when it comes to knowing the "it" places in Scottsdale just went down the tubes. FAIL. But hey, if you are reading this review you probably haven't been there yet either so just shut up and read, ok? Here is the dilly. I came here NYE. They had a $65 all you can drink special from 9p-2a that night. Nydia A. and I waited until the last minute to make plans and this seemed easy and pretty damn affordable, not to mention close to home. As a NYE venue I wasn't a big fan...but I do know a good (or even great) sports bar when I see one. What it isn't: Hoppin with booty shakin music (we had to beg the DJ to play what we deemed "dance worthy" music), filled with beautiful people, packed to the brim with a thirty minute wait to get in, pretentious, where you should go if you are a Scottsdale DB looking to get laid. What it is: A place to get good (strong) drinks for a reasonable price, convenient if you live within a five mile radius (they have a paddywagon free of charge), chill, and very conducive to the needs of sports enthusiasts. Oh and somewhere I can go without having to primp and wear six inch ankle breaking heels. (totally wish I got that memo BEFORE I dressed for NYE) The bottom line: You'll probably see me there during football season proudly sporting a Tebow jersey, yelling at the flat screens, beer in one hand and hot wing in the other.This is my kind of sport's bar! Good food, good atmosphere, good pricing and plenty of TVs for the sport's fan. There is plenty of seating both inside and outside and it appeared to be much smaller on the outside then it actually is on the inside. During a recent visit, we started with the hangover hummus which is spicy hummus and then I had the Sonoran burger with avocado. I would say that the food is a couple steps above normal bar food and this is very similar to a Zipps. It's the perfect spot to bring a group and have a casual but entertaining night out. It's also the perfect place to watch a game if you're near the McDowell Mountain Ranch area.

Restaurant name  Chick-fil-A

Review Text :
Chick-fil-a is comfort fast food for me. I love the original chicken sandwich; I add 1 pack of honey mustard. I grab a second honey mustard packet for dipping my delicious waffle fries - which, unfortunately, they sometimes skimp on, in my opinion. I have to tell you, though, I witnessed the talent of the best balloon artist I've ever seen at this location! (He's not there every week, but you'll find him there on some Wednesday afternoons for the whole "kids eat free" thing.) I was so mesmerized, as I waited in line to order and then for my food,  that I hardly noticed the wait and the fact that the place was overrun with little ones didn't detract from my experience! Chick-fil-a actually caters to the whole family thing really well. (And, their kids' meals have educational toys, often promoting literacy).

Restaurant name  Sugarbakers Cafe & Bakery
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
A nice little find tucked away in the overly pretentious Borgata shops, Sugarbakers is a new entry (only opened last month, I believe) into the competitive lunch market.  However, like Transformers, it's more than meets the eye.  In addition to traditional lunch fare (sandwiches & salads), they also serve breakfast and have a full working bakery that churns out cookies, brownies, pies & made to order cakes.At first I kinda thought this place was typically, Scottsdalianly overpriced.  However, look who they're competing against for your lunch dollar.  For $9 at Sugarbakers, you get a half-sandwich with REAL carved turkey they roasted that day, a bowl of homemade soup, a mound of kettle chips, a homemade mini-muffin, a couple pieces of carrot, a slice of pickle and an olive.  (I was a little like, "uhhhhh, why do I have an olive?" at first).  Compare that to $6 for Subway or $8 for something like Paradise Bakery.  The freshness and quality here are so far superior that you'd be a dumbass not to pick Sugarbakers.Also, I had a bit of an "OHMYGOD" moment.  I'm not sure if it's because I'd pretty much cut sweets out of my diet for the last month or so or what, but their chocolate chip cookie is effing ridiculously good.   They also had something called a "Cowboy Cookie" that had pecans & rice krispies in it.   It was novel, but not holycrapworthy like the chocolate chip.  Most of their lunch items are in the $7-11 range.  Next time I go, I have my eye on the "Sedona Special Salad", which has greens, turkey, cranberries & pecans.with a citrus vinaigrette or the "Sugarbakers Chopped Salad" that has greens, avocado, blueberries & walnuts.  Their breakfast stuff seems pretty fairly priced- Stack of pancakes for $5, Apple Praline or Bananas Foster French Toast (whoa, sounds good) for $8, Bacon & Eggs for $7.   I'll have to check it out and throw on a homemade cinnamon roll just for good measure.Also, like I mentioned, you can get cakes & pies to order.  When I was there, one lady was picking up 30 cakes for an event.  Sugarbakers also makes mention that they use organic & natural foods whenever possible.  The quality shows.

SPECIAL 3 item combos $8.99 + $3 Margaritas!! plus Chips & salsa plus bean dip for FREE-At all @stationcasinosWe visited Palace Station around 10pm Friday Evening and there was no wait to be seated during the #UNLVmbb game. Service was fast & friendly bringing drinks & chips/salsa out almost immediately. I ordered my regular the carne asada fajitas and the wife got a 3 item combo of beef enchilada,beef taco and something mexican.As you can see from whats pictured NOT what you think when you think fajitas, right? I'm thinking slightly sauteed peppers & onions , medium rare finely sliced carne asada with tortillas, pico and sour cream,guac on the side maybe even some cilantro and HOT sauce.Really cheap and cheesy. meat was tough and NOT marinated like you'd expect. Didn't even touch the rice & beans just didn't pass the look test. sidenote:  The sides pico/sour cream/guac were in the same small bowl and watered together-not very cool either.How this place has failed to find someone to cook good mexican food in Las #Vegas boggles the mind.After the last 2 visits, I feel differently about this Cabo location. Not all of the Cabo's are consistent and now this one isn't either. Major bummer! There was no line when hubby and I arrived, but we still stood there waiting for about 10 minutes before someone noticed us. I would have wondered if they were even open, but I called prior to see if they had a wait and any specials going and the girl who answered the phone said to come on down. Then once we were seated it took another 10 minutes to have chips, salsa, bean dip and drinks brought to out table. It would have been nice if we were acknowledged sooner.We ordered "Chili Con Queso" priced at $5.99 to start. This is the one thing here that is still consistently good. It has a blend of cheeses with onions, tomatoes, serrano chilies and comes with tortilla chips. For the price it is a great deal and goes a long way. I had the AYCE "Crispy Tacos" for my meal priced at $8.99 that included beans and rice. The beans were cracked on top and hard. The rice was so dry and flavorless. My tacos (chicken and ground beef) had a terrible flavor and the bottoms of the taco shells were so greasy and soggy that when I picked up my first taco the bottom fell out. I would have asked for new tacos, but the place was packed and I only saw 2 servers and one person clearing tables, so flagging someone down wasn't easy. I had honesty gotten my fill with the chips, salsa, bean dip (it wasn't cracked and hard like the beans on my plate) and chili con queso anyway and didn't want to wait any longer than we had been waiting during our experience already.Our server was nice (what I saw of him) and I could tell he was really trying, but with very little staff on hand he could only do so much. Maybe if they had the proper amount of help they could have put out better dishes like I have had in the past and service would have been more timely and just all around better.

I have really been craving Greek food and I was in the area so I thought I'd give this new place a try.I decided on getting their variety platter which consisted of Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Dolmades, Spanakopita and Falafel served with pita bread.(see pics)Oh how disappointing!*Strike 1~The baba ganoush was over pureed into a thin slimy goo, it didn't taste very good either. All the baba ganoush I have ever eaten has been thick and had some texture left to it with a very distinct flavoring. This was the worst I've ever had.*Strike 2~The Hummus was gritty and bland. I was really looking forward to the strong garlicky lemon taste, none of that here though. Again another worst ever.*Strike 3~The Dolmades(grape leaves) smothered in a thick tomato and lemon slime, had the mushiest, yet sticky and pasty rice inside, it was awful.I grew up on these and actually make them quite often(grandmas secret recipe), so I think I know what I'm talking about.  I've had bad grape leaves but these take the cake.*Your OUT!~The Falafel, well you can see from the picture they look more like cookies, but nowhere near as good. They were more like fried wet sand , dry with no flavor at all. I wouldn't feed these to my dog.The Spanakopita might have been the most edible part of this platter but by then it was too late, They had already been way past striking out in my book.I tell the waitress and she sends over the manager, to whom I explained why I was unhappy with my meal.She apologizes but the has the nerve to ask me:"WELL, ARE YOU GREEK?!!!"As a matter of fact YES I AM, I should be asking her that!I know good Greek when I eat it and especially when I make it myself with recipes taught to me by own Grandmother, and sorry honey but that wasn't it!I gave 2 stars only because she took it off my bill. OPA!

Came here for a sub and left with a big ole smile on my face!  Firehouse subs totally hit the spot.  They serve hot subs, and was amazed at how good they tasted.  I had the #3 which was roast beef and pastrami with all the fixings.They do have a great selection of hot sauces here, but I didn't try any of them.  The subs here come in 2 sizes, 8 inch and 12 inch.  Prices are actually quite reasonable, and I feel like I got a lot more then I paid for.  Tasty bread, a filling meal, and enough sub to make me happy.  They even sell their pickle buckets here.  Their those big drum looking things that are probably hold at least 5 gallons of goods for $2.  I guess the $2 goes towards a fireman's charity or something, but either way, its for a good cause.  Anyways, this place is worth checking out.  :-)

MMMMM... I just had another mouth orgasm today... We ate at the Pizzeria Circus Circus for dinner and they did not disappoint! Simple, 16' pepperoni fresh baked and piping hot! Plenty of cheese and topping. The crust was light and flaky. Delicious! Will definitely do a repeat the next time we stop by Circus Circus. All you can drink fountain soda and iced tea. Love that!

Review Text :
Hold up, hold your horses, not another Del Friscos review! This one isn't all rainbows and smiley faces though. Well, all things considered, they're still receiving 4 stars and I can honestly say at the end of the day, the Del doesn't disappoint. The stage is set once you browse the menu. It describes how to eat the bread, 'with your hands' and clear as day lets you know that YOU, "you mean me?", yes YOU control the pace of the meal. Maybe that's the reason for such limited reservations spots? Most definitely not a detrimental way of doing business. Del Friscos truly is a "can't miss" for restaurant week. Their version of turtle soup was yummay. Perfectly seasoned and quite filling. The steak - even hooked on phonics couldn't educate me enough come up with adequate adjectives to describe it. Unlike Del's adopted stepbrother Sully, the steak here is seasoned just right. The potatoes were good but nothing to call home to momma about. But that strawberry cheesecake...oh man. Do you like Strawberry Shortcake ice cream? This guy right here sure does and that's what that cheesecake tasted like. Now that's how you finish off a meal. As stated, it isn't all praise and worship though. Upon our arrival, we didn't even get greeted. Wait, are we at the right place? Is this the Westin or Del Friscos? Can I get a hello, bienvenidos, aloha, anything? Nope. We had to approach the hostess and introduce ourselves and reservation. Our first cocktail waitress wasn't all that nice either. Normally I wouldn't even give a rat's arse or give it a second thought but these two were almost, almost rude - at least by Del Frisco's standards. If it was any other place, I'd pay it no mind. But it's Del and let's face it, we all expect perfection. See what you guys have done Del Friscos? You're too damn good for your own good.

I love that I have this Korean mart down the street from me. And here I was thinking I'd be stranded in NC without kimchi for x number of years. This little market has been a saving grace for me. I can get my jars of kimchi, packets of soontofu mix, asian vegetables, snacks, seafood, or anything else I need from this one market. The restaurant in the back is tiny, but it does the job. The soontofu and bibimbap are good enough and there are plenty of little dishes provided. The people that work here are sweet and the prices are comparable to what I usually expect from a Korean restaurant.Come here for Korean food!I was in such a long withdrawal of authentic Asian food that eating at PePeRo deserved 5 stars! I would give it 10 even for being so close to where I live!Moving from LA to Charlotte is quite an adjustment, especially when it comes to the food scene. And PePeRo is now my saving grace.I ordered the Bibimbap and cleaned every speck of the bowl, the miso soup, and ALL the sides. Mind you, I'm a little 5 feet Asian girl.In summary, it's good ol' Korean home cooking and as a bonus, there's a small grocery store attached where I can conveniently do my Asian shopping!THIS is the place to go for Korean food!! When you first get there, the enterance is to the side where you might see some shopping carts. It's a bit awkward and a little more awkward once you get in because you don't know what to do. LOL! Half of it is a shop and the other half is the restaurant. But you'll be greeted with smiling faces and they'll ask if you're dining and sit you down. Once you've got a seat, it's smooth from there on. Pricing is very good, compared to other Korean restaurants I've been to. My dish cost around $9-$11 while at other places it runs to $15.It feels like eating at home, but with someone serving, cooking, and cleaning for you. The decorations on the wall are beautiful and sometimes they have cute decorations on the table too. All the food is always served with fresh yummy sides. Our favorite sides are the bean sprouts, spinach, and the fishcake (I believe it's fish cake). I always get the same thing each time because I just love it so much: Yuk Gae Jang. You MUST try their fried rice. I don't know why it's so good! It leaves you wanting more after one bite. I love how they serve their water. It's definitely not from the sink.If it's your first time eating Korean, it's always safe to go with a Kalbi or Bulgogi dish. You can venture out when you're brave enough. And like I said in my other reviews, go with a group, so you can try their dishes lol.  My niece loves going here because they have a "bell" service where you press a button and a bell goes off in the backroom to let them know if we need anything. They come and check up on you too, so it's not like they're sitting around for the bell.(Note: This review is about the restaurant portion of the grocery store.) Pepero, thank you for being in Charlotte! Besides the items I've tried in my previous review, I've since tried their kimchi jigae and yukae jang. I would try other items on the menu, but the latter two have recently won my heart.Don't expect anything fancy, but you will be served efficiently and attentively. Pepero can get pretty busy depending on the time you come, but I really think the servers try their best to make sure you have a fine dining experience. I appreciate that.I'm fan because PePeRo it's a spot where I can get eat an authentic Korean meal and shop for Asian food! I'm not going to lie - it can be a bit intimidating, especially if you've never been. Let me lay it out for you - PePeRo is located in Matthews, near the intersection of John St/Monroe Rd and Hwy 51.  The entrance is located on the side of the building - there aren't a ton of parking spots but it's adequate.  When you enter, you'll be entering the market portion of PePeRo and off to the right of the entrance is the restaurant. The dining room is split into a couple different sections, I suspect from the effort to add on more dining tables. Usually, someone is there to greet you and show you to a table. It can get rather busy during peak dinner hours.The menu is fairly straight forward - yaki mandoo, kimchi pancakes, bulgogi, etc - and it comes with the traditional banchan (side dishes).  My faves are the yaki mandoo and the kimchi pancakes.  The bulgogi portion is generous and comes with white rice. My husband usually gets the kimchi tofu soup. I've also had the cold buckwheat noodles which is yummy on a hot day!I have to admit my favorite part about visiting PePeRo is the market - I can pick up a lot of my Asian favorites, not just Korean! I can pick up Japanese curry cubes, roasted seaweed packs, miso paste, Filipino sardines, sauces galore, as well as green tea, barley tea, and rice!   So my two cents? Don't be intimidated to visit, there's usually someone who can help you out and direct you to what you're looking for.Disclaimer: this was my first exposure to Korean food. If I could recommend some more expert reviews to read on this, i would say check out Dan C, Ellen O, Peggy C and Christi K's posts. I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now. Dan C. took myself and some friends here on Monday night. We put him in charge of recommendations and ordering. We got a round of appetizers for our group of five and all different entrees. I don't know what anything is called... so bear with me. App wise kimchi pancake, steamed bun and the wonton-potsticker like goodness. I went with the bbq pork with steamed rice. Bottom line: it was all good. The seafood noodle type soup was LOADED with seafood. And best part... it's all a ton of food. We all had leftovers for the next day. Split 5 ways we each spent only $16. What a deal.Some things to know (for those not familiar with PePeRo or Korean cuisine)-There's a bell at your table for service.-Try all the sides that come out with your food.-If you're coming from Charlotte on Monroe Rd, turn before the restaurant. I drove past it and turned into the driveway on the other side which is actually for another business.-Go explore the grocery store. -Both the store and the restaurant take credit cards. However, please note the grocery store does have a $20 minimum.-They do have plastic forks for the chopstick-challenged. And by chopstick challenged, I am talking about myself. This is the girl who eats sushi with her hands.-Don't be afraid to ask questions. Someone can point you in the right direction.I will definitely be back. I loved the vibe here. It was comforting and kind of felt like getting a homecooked meal at a relative's house.Loved it!  This place screams authentic.  Now, I don't think I am the foremost expert on Korean food and judging its authenticity but I can easily say that this was exactly what I was looking for.  A little hole in the wall Korean Grocery store with a quaint restaurant in the back.  It had one section for booths and one section for tables.  Each table had a service bell on the table when you are ready.  Otherwise, the staff will leave you the F alone (which can be nice sometimes rather than being bugged ever two seconds).  On to the food....  I ordered the Pork Bo go bi (something like that, hahaha).  It was.... BANGING!  It came over some white rice and was cooked in a full-flavored kimchi type sauce.  The spice was perfect for me (not a huge fan of really spicy) and it didn't take over the taste at all.  Just right!  Also, the sides were a perfect compliment.  They were free and they were basically little sample dishes:  seaweed salad, kimchi, sautéed veggies.  Enjoy!-Ian M.

Restaurant name  Queen Creek Olive Mill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The Queen Creek Olive Mill is the perfect outing if you're looking for something new to do or if you're hosting out of town guests. It's located approximately 45 miles from downtown Phoenix on the edge of Queen Creek. Allow for at least 2 hours to spend at the QCOM, which can be filled with the 30-minute tour, sampling, lunch, shopping, or just hanging out with a bottle of wine at one of thee seating areas available. One inside the store/café, an umbrella covered patio, or the picnic benches shaded by the olive trees. The Café offers breakfast specials, sandwiches, paninis, soups, salads, bruschetta, gelato, and special wines. The store sells a variety of olive oils, stuffed olives, cremas, and tapenades made from olives grown/harvested from the local grove.    Recommended items.-Burnt Mozzarella Bruschetta (3); melted mozarella, roasted garlic, and a tasty oregano pesto- burnt to perfection!    -Mushroom Bruschetta (3); wild mushrooms, herbs, and caramelized onions-  A generous mix of shrooms and onions. -Mansi Panini; Tequila lime roasted chicken, fontina , sun dried tomato, parmesan tapenade and tomato parmesan crema: comes with a side of olives and chips. The tour:An educational guide on how the olives are grown, harvested, and processed. The complimentary sampling bar includes a variety of:Olive Oils: about 10 to taste from- surprising twist were the vanilla bean, blood orange, and lemon infused olive oils. Tapenades: 7 to taste from - My fav was the caramelized onion and fig Stuffed Olives: About a dozen to taste from - All were great but my top two were the Oregano feta and Vermouth garlic stuffed olives.The olives, olive oils, and tapenades sold on site are great gift ideas for folks looking for Arizona made products. Will be adding a few to my x-mas list. Our trip to the Olive Mill was very enjoyable and we'll be adding it to our must see AZ places for our visiting friends and family.Sure it is out there....way out there.  But the support and patronage of unique cultural spots requires a little bit of sacrifice.  Make a day off it.  Visit the Schnepf Farms in the morning and have a nice casual lunch at the Mills.  I guarantee it is a better Saturday then whatever is on TV.The location itself is rather lacking. If they were to develop the area and landscape more they could turn it into a real destination.  As it currently stands, it is still a great place to enjoy a splendid meal and casually talk away an hour or two.  The Del Piero is spacious and has several incredible options that will ensure multiple visits.  The Cerignola panini is substantial without weighing you down.  It has several great flavors in just the right portions so that you can enjoy each one.  They have a variety of great breakfast dishes as well.  Also, you can't leave without buying some of the product.  Who knew the Olive was this versatile. The prices are on the high side but that is to be expected for boutique items such as these.  Don't forget to get some vanilla, olive oil cupcakes.  These things make Sprinkles seem so "Betty Crocker" in comparison.Since I've always been a huge fan of Popeye and Olive Oil, it's no wonder I was drawn to this place... :)Thanks to Robert M's review, I checked out QCOM's website and ordered a holiday gift for an out-of-state friend... the process was simple as can be and I felt safe using my credit card on their secure site.  I received confirmation via email a few seconds after the transaction went through... I hope my friend enjoys her Arizona made gift and I look forward to visiting Queen Creek Olive Mill sometime in person.  I'm sure it will be a fun little field trip!Olive oil has a ubiquitous influence in the foodie world, but how much do we know about what goes into producing a fine extra virgin?The Queen Creek Olive Mill is where all of your questions will be answered.  Begin your visit with a $5 tour, which "walks" you through the growing process, and what makes Queen Creek an excellent location for Olive groves.  Why, although not organically certified, these olives are not treated with chemicals or pesticides.  Find out about the olive harvest, why there is no such thing as a black olive, and why The Mill's Master Blender carefully and meticulously supervises each harvest from begin to end.The tour takes you into the heart of the operation, the presses.  All olive oil is extracted by mechanical means, keeping its integrity.  In the pressing room, you can sample varieties of olive oils as well as olives.After experimenting for over a decade with different olives, the result is a grove of over a dozen varieties of olives.  Their extra virgin has a distinct flavor due to a few practices inherent in their harvesting.  Olives are harvested by hand (no fallen olives) and cold pressed within 24 hours.  Due to late harvests between the months of September and December, their olive oil has a fruity yet buttery taste.  And you can sample all of their infused oil at the Olive Oil bar. I highly recommend the Meyer Lemon for dipping and cooking, as well as the White Truffle oil.  For baking their Chocolate olive oil and vanilla bean are amazing, and can replace the need for regular vegetable or cooking oils.  The differences in moisture and flavor are astounding!~  There is a reason why they claim that "you are literally buying one of the best olive oils in the world."Along with a plethora of cooking oils, there are body care products made with their EVOO.  The body creams leave my skin moist and fresh for nearly a day, the lip balms are also exceptional.The cafe has a fresh assortment of sandwiches and salads.  Although the bruschettas look great, they are tiny pieces of extremely dry and crusty bread, the various toppings lacking in freshness and flavor - unfortunately.  But the most important thing to try on your sojourn here is the Olive Oil cake  You will never have cake that is more filled with flavor, more buttery, and for lack of a better word - more luscious.Wines from around the world can also be purchased by the bottle in their wine section.A fantastic place for a date, a relaxing lunch, an education...We like to support locally owned businesses, but some local establishments make it so difficult for us to do so.My wife and I went for lunch and ordered a sandwich (Lucca: Herb roasted turkey) and a bruschetta plate (Burnt Mozzarella & Pesto: Wild Mushroom: & Caramelized Red Onion & Fig Tapenade). FYI, there is no table service so you have to order at the counter.  I will say that the staff was friendly, so that's the positive, though there should have been more staff working the counter because it got backed up. The sandwich tasted OK, but the presentation was unimaginative, the bread not fresh (so dry it was falling apart) and the portions smaller than similarly priced fare fare from other establishments we frequent.  Frankly, the best thing on our sandwich plate was the potato chips!The bruschetta was laughable! For 6.99 we received 3 SMALL slices of bread that were only partially covered with a visually unappetizing mix of toppings. The bread was not adequately toasted so each piece was somewhat soggy. In addition, none of the toppings were warm, even though the cheese on two pieces was melted and the third topped with what we would describe as a chunky mushroom paste (that was claimed as served hot)... which led us to believe these items are prepared in advance and not to order, hence the cool temp and soggy bread.Seriously! $6.99 for 3 small slices? Haven't the owners ever been to Postino to see what presentation, flavor and value are all about. Check the photo link in my profile and you'll find the one I posted of QCOM's sorry excuse for a bruschetta plate. And to all of you who will argue "but the Postino Bruschetta is 13.50"! Yes, it's nearly double the price, but at Postino you receive: A) 4 LARGE pieces of bruschetta, cut into thirds for 12 slices total, each slice about the size of one QCOM bruschetta; B) Easily triple the amount of toppings on each piece: C) something flavorful that you'll actually enjoy eating; D) A beautiful presentation; E) Table service from friendly, knowledgeable staff.Don't get me wrong. I think it's great that the Rea Family has brought a fine range of olive oils and related products to Arizona and we have used their oils in our home kitchen.Unfortunately, the del Piero eatery is operated more like a tourist destination where they figure it's a "one shot" opportunity to get maximum return for minimum investment from customers who probably won't be returning. Our suggestion, take the tour, buy some olive oil... then go somewhere else for lunch where they have taken the care to give you superior ingredients, prepared with skill, in sufficient quantity to justify the price and with friendly efficient service to boot.Oh yeah... as for the Gelato. Don't bother. Go to Frost at San Tan if you want a real, authentic, phenomenal Gelato experienceThis comment for the owners: While we were waiting for our lunch we went over to the wine tasting area. The young lady hosting the tasting was very pleasant and outgoing, but when we heard her say the Pinot Gris was made from white Pinot Noir grapes we, and the other couple tasting at the time, realized we wouldn't get an education with our tasting. To QCOM and all other establishments doing tastings... please, please, please don't have a wine novice doing the pouring.When I was invited to join friends on their visit to Queen Creek Olive Mill during the Harvest Festival, I jumped at the chance to play 'tourist' in my home state.There are a lot of things to like here, and we saw all of them: - Lunch in the Eatery at the Mill - while I thought the food was just OK, the cupcakes I tried later (Meyer Lemon and Vanilla Bean) were amazing!- Olive Oil 101 class ($5 per person) - lots of good information on how olive oil is made.  I learned why I cannot stand the taste of black olives from a can, but loved the green olives at the Mill - it is all in the preparation!- Marketplace - I cannot pass up an opportunity to shop!  The Marketplace had a nice assortment of olive oils, balsamic vinegars, olive-oil based bath & body products as well as a selection of gift items and wines.  I managed to hold back just a little, but still walked out with some great things including a super tasty Asiago Parmesan tapenade, Meyer Lemon olive oil and strawberry balsamic vinegar.  I told myself they would make great gifts, but let's face it, I will keep them all for myself.Make an afternoon of your visit!  Enjoy the gorgeous weather while listening to the live music outside and savoring some wines from the Marketplace.  Cheers!Free Olive Oil 101 class with check-in! This place is crazy. Part breakfast spot, part olive oil mill, part tourist trap... the freaking hat trick of out-of-town experiences. I came here with a large group not fully knowing what to expect, I mean Queen Creek Olive Mill? Is this some kind locally based Marie Calendar's? Not really, but sorta?Lets start with breakfast. This is not the type of place where you sit down and a server takes your order. You first walk-in and grab a menu, slowly making your way to the counter where order your breakfast or lunch. You'll then get a food beeper and either sit inside or outside. I'll suggest inside for you, unless you like flies trying to steal a bite of your food. We sat outside and the view was nice, but like I mentioned before, flies bruh. Also if you come here with a big party, try to order all at the same time. Ordering separately will most likely result in someone finishing his or her meal while the others have been summoned by the food beeper. This happened to us and I felt rushed being once of the last ones to get food, but whatever you live and learn. I ordered Olive Farmers Breakfast: Two eggs, herb roasted smashed potatoes, maple sausage, and toasted farm bread (sourdough). I went against my breakfast instinct and played it safe with this traditional plate and it was pretty lackluster. This was something I could have easily made at home, basic eggs, potatoes, and very dry sausage. My GF ordered the Olive Mill Benedict and with one bite, I had breakfast envy. I also ordered a "Bloody Caesar". This was pretty much V8 with vodka wine. No flavor or spice, I had to add everything else myself. The store inside the Queen Creek Olive Mill was a nice touch. Everything from olive oil based soaps, olive tapenades, multiple stuffed olive concoctions, even chocolate covered almonds made to look like olives. And yes, of course, olive oil as far as the eye could see. Great spot to pick up a few gifts for friends and family. This place is a little pricey and far off the beaten path, but if you live near by and have yet to come, it's worth a Saturday afternoon stroll.

Commonly known as the best Pekin duck in mtl (according to my chinese friends)This restaurant used to be on Clark second floor, across from maison VIP, but now it's moved to la gauchetiere and st-dominique, first floor.If you come here you have to get the Pekin duck, it's their best dish bar none. My only complaint is you never seem to get enough pancakes, and when you order more it takes a long time to come... Pekin duck is a 3 dish affair, they use the whole duck. Comes with soup first from the bones, then it's the Pekin duck with pancakes sauce and pickled carrots and dicon radish. Lastly chop suey with duck meat, you can ask them to turn this dish into a noodle dish for an extra charge.The salt baked squid is quite good, good saltiness and mildly crispy and soft inside. The mongolian beef here is decent except it's just too sweet...sweet and sour pork here is just average, nothing to crow about. It's one of my favorite dishes eventhough according to my chinese friends it's not authentic chinese but more north american chinese...Whatever one of them told me general tao's was not a real sichuan dish... low and behold i went to China no less and found it on their menu... turns out it's a real sichuan dish except they use sichuan peppercorn in china but not here, something to do with customs and peppercorn pest infestation... so there's variations in north american and chinese versions of dishes...All in all, it's just like all the chinese restaurants in chinatown MTL, they're all about same same, except they make one dish better that anyone else, and this one has the best Pekin duck.

-Friendly service, very attentive, slow to bring bill.-Food was average, a bit on the extreme salty side.-Prices were a bit high, but they offer evening dinner specials for $6.99.-Server talked us into ordering the Wonton soup-Large was $7.95 with skimpy portions (a few wontons, sliced chicken, tough beef, 2-3 shrimp, half cup of cabbage) and lots of bland broth. Not worth the price.-Restroom clean, but no soap in Women's restroom.-Decor was very nice.-Parking is very convenient.-Next door to a Barber shop.

Review Text :
What a lovely surprise located in...well...Surprise! Mr. Hottie and I decided to have dinner somewhere different. The plan was left to me so I decided to head out to Surprise. I have heard some rumblings of a new bistro out there so I hopped on Yelp to look it up. I made a reservation for 8pm and headed out the door. When we arrived we were immediately struck by the nice decor and cool music. We were greeted warmly and had to wait only a few moments to be seated. We got a nice dimly lit corner table, perfect. We surveyed the patrons, while the website does say the attire is casual, I wouldn't suggest coming in shorts and a t-shirt. Those who did, didn't look like they belonged. Maybe shorts and a polo? Maybe. Anyway, onto our visit. Our hostess seated us and asked us if we had been there before. We responded no and she went on to thank us for our visit and welcome us to the bistro. What was cool about her greeting was that it wasn't like she was running through a script in her mind, it was actually a genuine welcome! No dead behind the eyes Scottsdale hostess here! Our waitress, Jessica was friendly and bubbly. She usually worked the lunch shift so she was a tad shaky on dinner service but we were forgiving. She was doing a great job and trying really hard to make sure we were happy. We started out with a martini. Mr. Hottie had a "Stuffed Goose" which is Grey Goose with stuffed blue cheese olives. I had the Valentino, a pomegranate martini. We both enjoyed our cocktails. We also ordered a 2004 petit syrah to go with our dinner. Ahh.. dinner. Let's start with the appetizer. (Tree hugger/PETA member beware) We ordered the foie gras. The plate was very unceremoniously dropped onto our table by a food runner. She didn't even announce what the food was, just sort of plopped it in front of us and said "There ya go!". Not kidding. Oh well, a minor hiccup. While I was expecting a nice seared piece of duck liver, we got something more in the line of pate. It came with hunks of toast and a compote of apple and figs. It was still VERY delicious. Not as savory as a seared piece of liver, it was still very yummy and I will get it again. We also shared a beet and goat cheese salad. I grew up thinking that I detested beets. They came out of a can, and they tasted like pennies. WRONG. I actually got coaxed into trying beets again and they were so yummy! The goat cheese with the beets were great! The bed of arugula was a little much for me, but that's a personal choice.  Mmm Dinner...We both ordered something from the Chef's entrees of the day. Don't be sad when you see the small dinner menu. The chef adds about 3-4 entrees onto that. Mr. Hottie ordered the thick cut pork chop topped with an apple and bacon mixture, and on the side was broccolini and curried cauliflower, talk about savory and spicy (not HOT but just full of flavor). The pork chop was perfectly cooked, if you like your pork chop well done. It wasn't too dry and the meat was moist and tender. The curried cauliflower was crisp and fresh, not at all mushy.  I had the duck breast with sticky rice, cabbage rolls and a slice of roasted pineapple on the bottom. It was DIVINE. The duck breast was juicy and delicious. All the flavors ran together in harmony. The cabbage rolls were just that, a small egg roll filled with cabbage. Sounds simple right? Wrong, the cabbage was so good. It was very well seasoned and the roll wasn't greasy at all. The ONLY thing I would have changed is that the ball of sticky rice was CRUNCHY on the outside. I don't know if that was the intention of the chef, but being a sticky rice/ any rice eater, it came off as though the rice had been left out to dry. Other than that, heaven. We took our time with our dinner, sat, drank wine, and surveyed the area again. The chef had made an appearance at the table next to us. I understand that one of the gentlemen at at the table was from France and that is where the Chef is from. So she made a very friendly visit. As our dinner lulled and the restaurant emptied a bit, we were hoping the chef would stop by to say hello as she was blowing out candles around us, but she left us alone with our wine. Oh well, maybe next time I'll grab her. After all there was a lot of hand holding and goo goo eyes going on at our table. Maybe she didn't want to interrupt. We did get visits from the Chefs Hunky Husband who was very courteous, and the Hostess came by again to make sure our visit was going well. Talk about great service! Vogue Bistro is a breath of fresh air in an area riddled with chain establishments. I suggest restaurant owners take notice and maybe form a restaurant row or something. Wouldn't that be cool!I have a feeling that Vogue Bistro will be on my list of places to go whenever I'm way out west. This place was fantastic and a must try!Nice place.  The outdoor patio is enclosed and has a fireplace with a bunch of nice tables.We were there on a Saturday night between 5-7pm and it was EMPTY.   The head chef is really nice and she asks for feedback on her food.The food is AWESOME.  I had the scallop special... they were EXCELLENT.  No rubbery mess... it was soft and cooked.  The sweet potatoes were great.  I tried a friend's steak... awesome... and I tried the duck.  Even more awesome.I truly was surprised.Then comes the alcohol, my favorite part. heheI had two martinis... the De La Renta and the... oh man. I can't remember the second one.  The waitress suggested it so I never asked for it by name.   The martinis were great.  Some martinis taste way too much like vodka... these were great and fruity.The service was awesome... very friendly.The music... I know it's meant to be classy with the opera... it was like "Pavaratti and Friends" or something like that... it was way too loud and overwhelmed everything inside. We kept asking them to turn it down.But otherwise, it was great.My 6 best girl-friends and I decided to give Vogue Bistro a try after hearing a rave review from a family member. We eagerly arrived on a Friday evening and found the house was packed! We did have a reservation and were seated promptly outside on the patio. Walking through the restaurant showed us a lovely sophisticated dining room with just the right volume of music. The restaurant was brimming with patrons. And then there's the patio.....Vogue Bistro is located at the far end of a strip mall and it backs up to a residential neighborhood. I suppose that explains the cats who were milling around outside on the patio looking for scraps of anything delectable that might come their way. I am hoping that it wasn't a sign that perhaps there were rodents in the area as well, but given that there is so much seafood on the menu, I am hopeful that this is what drew the cats to the patio. Not that we minded the feline visitors....but it's just not something you typically expect. The patio is ok. They do have heaters in case it is a cool evening, but, overall, the dining experience is a bit lacking if you have to dine on the patio...if not for the cats but for the lack of ambiance. The cuisine at Vogue is refreshingly upscale without the upscale price. The chef is pleasant and friendly and works her ass off in the kitchen. There are so many chefs in the Valley who don't actually cook anymore, rather they stand in the kitchen yelling. Oh wait..and they are usually men. hahaha. We enjoyed the flat bread as well as a recommended appetizer of the day which was slow to arrive, but worth the wait. My dining companions enjoyed a variety of dishes from the skewers to the meatloaf to the delicious hamburgers. Again, the meals were very slow to arrive, but once they did, they were delicious. Our server was pleasant, but seemed put out by our large table. This did reflect on her tip overall, I regret to say since our bill was well over $100. One surprise at Vogue was the treat of the most delicious margarita that we've ever tasted. The agave nectar was house made and I truly think that was the key. Overall, I would say that Vogue Bistro is a very nice change in the typical chain restaurant laden experiences you find in Surprise, but be prepared to be there for a while. This is an experience you want to savor.Talk about a FEZ knock-off.  Here I was, all excited to see something interesting pop up in the boondocks of the valley and this is what I get?  What a waste!To start, this place is small.  Not that small is a knock on a place (I love Matt's) but this is just inefficient use of space.  They've added some sun-shade and a patio to create more tables but it just looks tacky.  The bar takes up almost half of the interior space and does not appear to do the business that the tables do.  Poor execution of use of space.Then, the waiter we had was a pretentious ass.  He was pushy, insistent, and not helpful.  It is amazing he even asked for our orders and didn't just bring us what he thought we should be eating.We had some sweet potato fries and calamari for appetizers.  The fries were good but no where near as good as FEZ.  The calamari was more fried carrots and lemon than meat.  The fried carrots were fine but the whole thing was pretty cheaply put together.What they don't tell you online is that almost all of their sandwiches are not served after 4.  Since that eliminated everything that looked good on the menu, the wife and I ordered a bunch of sides and split them.  The mac & cheese was pretty good.  The cornbread was fine.  The garlic mash was missing the garlic.  Really disappointing.  This is not a place would would recommend, even if I lived out there.  If I were stuck out in Surprise, I would go to the BabbO on Bell before I wasted my time at Vogue.This is my response to Roman Y's very rude comment on my original review: Trust me Roman, you can't make this stuff up. I assure you, I am not a competitor. I'm a mom, and a foodie. I do know a lot about customer service though. I have worked in the service industry for years, and both of my experiences at Vogue were textbook examples of what NOT to do. Exactly what would be my motivation for making up a review? Isn't the point of Yelp to learn reviews from the customers? In a way, it's kind of like having secret shoppers. Furthermore, if you don't want to hear reviews about your restaurant, don't put yourself out there. A smart business owner uses criticism to improve their business. This is just another example of making excuses instead of just fixing the problems. No restaurant can be perfect all the time, but when those problems are brought to your attention, you, as the owner should go out of your way to make it right, not give me a long story about how it's not your fault, and there's nothing you can do about it. I'm willing to forgive a lot when a manager or owner makes a sincere effort to correct, and then go the extra mile to retain my business. The bottom line is, I WANTED to like this place. I was excited for the opening. Our first visit was the week of the opening so I figured that was why we had such a crazy bad experience (it's still no excuse). But when we decided to give it a second chance several months later, and it was still terrible, I was very disappointed. You can get on here and call me a liar if you like, Roman. But, it will not make your restaurant better, and it will not change the fact that I had two memorably bad experiences which I have told to everyone I know.I can back up Kendra's statement about the menus as well. We had to wait ten minutes for a menu because there were non available.Finally made it here for dinner service.  Made a reservation for 4 at 8pm and was seated immediately at 750pm when we got there.  The hostess asked if we care for outdoor dinning, which is not my normal option, but I felt like trying something different.  So we ended up in the great outdoors on the patio.The outdoor patio is nice with a roaring fire, overhead heaters, and plenty of seating.  It is only open on one side, which faces a back alley.  Not really a star gazing setting and every so often you are a few feet away from a speeding car using the alley.  I think I will eat inside next time, wish the patio had more views, but not much to look at here.  I can also note that being outside, at least in our case reduced attention by the staff.  I almost felt forgotten at times as my soda sat empty waiting for a refill.  I would have to speak up if I wanted a refill.  I would not of noticed, but we did not receive dinner till 830pm.  So be prepared for a 30 minute wait for dinner.  I decided to go with the one of the dinner specials which was the pork tenderloin.  The polenta had an excellent taste, but was on the dry side.  Almost like it sat for awhile.  Like a film on top of it had formed on it.  The balsamic reduction was good and almost saved the dish.  With the balsamic reduction the pork tenderloin was edible.  I used the balsamic reduction t add moisture to the pork.  The pork was so over cooked that I could not eat the dry meat without dipping it into the sauce.  I could not even finish 1 tenderloin on my plate.  I usually do not send dishes back and I was trying to eat it without complaint.  Luckily Aura C. waved down a waitress and they took it away.  They did inform me that I could have something else, but at the cost of another 30 minutes of our time.  I think I lost my appetite at that point.Another dinner guest of ours noted lipstick staining on her water glass.  She ending up drinking a soda and let her water glass sit.  So after a long hour for dinner I noted our waitress came to our table a total of 4 times, that included taking the order, taking my dish away, asking if we care for desert, and taking the bill.  Of the 4 times we had to wave her down to note the pork was dry.  I can recommend lunch service, I have had great service then and good food.  I cannot recommend dinner service however.  With such inconsistent service, food, and staff I am sure I would not bring my out of town friends here to enjoy food and the city.  I can say it is a great lunch stop, but dinner still seems to need some work.  I am still trying to put this restaurant on a must eat list since it is only minutes from my house.  Looks like I need to travel still to get good service and food.There were so many things wrong with this place. Even though we had a reservation, we had to wait 15 minutes to get seated after our scheduled time. First off, let me say that I have lived in Paris and other parts of France but it has been many years.AMBIANCE: Eclectic decor, imagine black, white, and pink. Unfortunately, my view was of a huge flat screen TV in a gilded frame over the bar with a basketball game playing. If this "embodies Aurore's vision of an original authentic restaurant" I'd like to know what bistro in France she had in mind. I'll be going back to Paris soon, so I'll update my review if I am wrong. Also, not so classy to walk by an open tray of silverware (health code violation?) on the way to being seated, of which our hostess later was wrapping in cloth napkins ON the hostess station at the entrance as her side work. Upon being seated, table was bare: NOTHING, no place setting, no candles, nada. What were we waiting for?FOOD: I was a little surprised (no pun in intended!) to see Italian and other non-French items on the menu such as lasagna and eggplant parmesan. I guess this is what they mean by "classic French techniques with traditional American influences," but again, I'll let you know when I see meatloaf on a Paris bistro menu and eat my words. Forget about the mushroom appetizer; READ: VERY SMALL, as there are only 2 stuffed mushroom caps on the plate. Beforehand, I had asked the waiter if they were portobello, which at first he agreed but then retracted. I can see why. The foie gras was okay, but I would have preferred a seared version of this dish.We waited OVER AN HOUR for our entrees to arrive. And even then, my filet, compared to the other diners at the table who ordered the same, was smaller and overcooked. The sauce was very nice and I can see how this was part of the chef's training. I also liked the potatoes au gratin. Unfortunately, this dish is very small for the price: I've had airplane meals in coach bigger than this. Overall, this place is OVERPRICED.SERVICE: Our waiter had a little bit of an attitude, so this was in line with an authentic French bistro; however, his lack of efficiency and attention to our table was not. He never poured our wine even once after serving it and we never saw him during our long sojourn waiting for our entrees. After he dropped off the entrees, he NEVER came back to even ask how everything was. Actually, he never once asked how anything was. And at the end he only made excuses for why the kitchen could not handle such a busy night. So what's your excuse for poor service?Gordon Ramsay would have a FIELD DAY with this place. Think Amy's Baking Company....everyone here must be in denial of how bad things are. And Ramsay would tear another one on the chef for arrogantly referring to this place as an authentic French bistro "with reasonably priced food of very high quality served by knowledgeable and attentive staff." Maybe people in Surprise who have never traveled internationally or even eaten in an excellent restaurant may think this place is the balls, but she's not fooling me.

"Welcome to the Best part of your Day."That's what the cashier said to me when I walked in. I gave him a half smile as I really thought about what he said and then placed my order. Ordered a #9 and #10 combos, a good solid Italian and roast beef sandwich respectively.Service speed hasn't changed much. It is still as fast and speedy as ever. My sandwich's are always done before I can even fill up both of my drinks. I bag up the sandwiches, chips and put my drinks in the carrier and walk out. As I started to open the door, the same cashier told me to "Have a great day" and gave me a smile. I really started to think about what he said when I first walked in there. "Welcome to the best part of your day."He didn't know I was having a crappy day. That I was at work since 4:30 in the morning, finally getting a break from work at 1 pm even if it was just to drive a pick my president up a sandwich. He didn't know that I was stuck in a 4 hour meeting today. Nor did he know the handful of new policies I had to write and implement once I got back to work.I drove back to work thinking, that man was ALMOST right. The best part of my day is always coming home to my hunny and son but other than that, it was a good part of my day. I am not trying to be too personal but I just need to relate a little and make you feel how important customer service truly is (at least to me). As stated in my previous review about Jimmy Johns, they have a good solid sub. Love their pickles and cookies even more. You can't go wrong with their food. However, this location had lacked in the customer service department. And in a business where customer service is YOUR business, it is a very important detail. And during my last couple of visits, the service has been better but not great but after today, I just had to do an update and upgrade them to a 4.Thank you Jimmy Johns for giving me one part of the best part of my day!

I volunteered myself to help the new boss from Dallas move his mattresses from storage to his new home by buying a truck 4 years ago. FNG.I had put in a few hours at work, and started to get that grumpiness that can only mean that it is time for a bite. You see without food the grumpiness evolves into rash hostility and I decided it was far too soon to pummel my new boss with his own queen sized pillow top mattress.I decided to finally try Z-Pizza as it is right down the street. I ordered a slice, a salad and a soda, while chuckling at the aliteration.The girl working the counter had that first job perkiness to her which was enjoyable. She really seemed to hope that I enjoyed my first trip.The pizza was tasty, thin crust healthyish style. I was a little sad that I had to wait for my salad while I had my pizza, because I planned to eat the salad first making sure the last taste I left with was delicious pizza, but as it turned out the pear and garganzola salad was the highlight of the meal. The walnuts were not over candied, the pears were fresh and ripe, it was perfect for taking away the grumps.I did not throw mattresses.

Review Text :
A place called "Honey Pig," how can you not like it?!  We've been on a mission to try out this Korean restaurant after passing by and seeing heaping piles of food being grilled in the center of the tables.Last night, with a party of five, we finally had a chance.  We knew right away it was best to get a combo - so #2 Honey Pig Combo for $59.99 it was.  It's meant for about three to four people, so we figured we could add more later on.  It comes with Korean Pork, Beef Prime, Neck Flesh of Pork, Hot Baby Octopus, Seafood Bean Paste Soup, Fried Rice, and either 1 bottle of Soju or Korean Beer.After putting in our order, the waiter came back with iced Korean tea.  This was actually the first time I have ever seen the tea served on ice and it was very refreshing.  Something so nice needs to be served in tall glasses instead of small regular tea cups.About nine different banchan was brought over, which included cabbage kim chee, bean sprouts, cucumber kim chee, green onion salad, fish cake, tiny fish, raw garlic, sliced jalapenos, pickled daikon, a bean dipping paste, and my favorite - sesame oil with Korean salt.  He only brought over one dish of each, so we were soon requesting refills on just about everything.The raw foods were soon to arrive and the waiter laid out the beef and pork onto the hot wok-like grill in the center.  He also added some bean sprouts and cabbage to the middle.  As we waited for our meat to cook, we dove into the banchan.  We also asked about the rice, which he then brought over five bowls of steamed white rice ($2/each).As we devoured our meat and our grill became empty, we sat around wondering about our octopus.  It was sitting in a bowl on the next table, but we weren't sure what to do next since they had shut our fire off.  When we finally got their attention, they asked if we wanted our bill.  We asked about the octopus, and only then did he realize that it was still sitting raw on the next table.  So, he turned on the grill and cooked the octopus.  The BF asked about the soup, and only then did the waiter ask if we wanted our fried rice.  (Uh...yeah!)  We were quite bothered by this since they were already asking us if we wanted to pay and we hadn't received half of our meal still!  The fried rice was also added to the grill and we got two bowls of the soup to share amongst us.We really enjoyed the food - it was tasty, great flavor, and just a good meal overall.  4 stars for food.The service on the other hand is what makes me frustrated.  We were forgotten about, and I'm not sure if it's because we were in the corner or what.  We always had to ask about getting our tea refilled, and when we asked if we could just have the pitcher, they said no. (They only had one pitcher!)  I asked for more napkins, which never arrived until I asked again.  The different waiters would come by and shut the heat off before our food was cooked and it was just so hard to get their attention.  (One waiter finally mentioned that they were understaffed with only three waiters that night.  They just looked unorganized.)  We finally said we were ready for the check, which also took forever to come!  (Did they want us to pay or not?)  2 stars for the service.I'm used to getting shikhye at the end of the meal, but they didn't have it here either!  Argh!I definitely want to go back, but I can only hope the service will be a lot better the next time!  (And I'm sure we're going to bring a larger party the next time we come too!)Sidenote: They offer a 20% from 10 pm to 8 am.  Are they open 24 hours then?  I'm not sure! (You can find pics of our dinner in the business profile!)All You Can Eat awesomeness for only $20 a head.  I'm from San Jose, CA and it gets pretty damn pricey for All You Can Eat Korean BBQ.  Being in Vegas, don't come here right before a night out or you'll smell like food the whole night.  Come here strictly for eating.  All you can eat is now for a limited time during the evening so make sure you check first.  But this place is still good to order off the menu.  But if you're hungry....go during All You Can Eat hours....SUPER worth it.My boyfriend and my homies came here this past weekend and I treated for Mother's Day.  It was definitely worth it at $20 per person because we ate A LOT.  We ordered like 5 orders of beef tongue, 2 orders of pork belly, 1 order of roast beef, 1 order of BBQ ribs, 2 order thinly sliced beef, and we even got the small calf intestines.    Everything tasted good.  All the meat was flavorful, was well marinated, and easy to cook.  They help you out in the beginning, but while you're sitting there, you get to finish off the cooking yourself. I don't recommend the roast beef though because its cubed.  I like thin sliced.  Faster to cook and tastes way better.The salad, kim chi, sprouts, and other side dishes were all good too.  Be careful though, they can make you full.  But the salad is yummy...no need for rice!Come here in a group.  It is a fun and interacitve  dining experience that should be shared among good people on a good night for good vibes!3.5 stars.  I prefer going here over Kaya or Woo-che for sure though if I'm doing AYCE on Spring Mountain.  My wife and I just get continuous doses of the beef tongue, pork belly (my fav) and the marinated beef.  I also love the grilled kimchi and bean sprouts. Wash that all down w/ Hite beer and there's a great Korean party going on in my stomach.I'm taking a half star off for the service but it wasn't that big of a detterant.  It just could've been better.Wow the service here sucks. I really need to be Korean to get anything around here. I had to ask for my banchan to be brought......... really?  I thought it's gratuitously given without question.  Other than that, service was nonexistent for the rest of the night.  You are forewarned.  Don't come here if you don't speak Korean.Updated: Angry and confused, I left $0 tip for the sub-sub-par service with a note saying "Thank you for your service".  As I was leaving the restaurant, the waiter came running out screaming "Sir, you didn't leave tip".  I kindly asked him rhetorically "Well....how much do you think the tip should be?"  In a swift motion, while running back into the store he said "You can just keep it".  And so I did.The bbq is very good, but the service is horrible. They won't tend to you if you're not Korean. I thought it was a figure of my imagination when it happen the first 2 times I went, but nope. The third and last time I ate there was for my dad's birthday. We walked in and was waiting 10 mins because the restaurant looked busy. Another group walked in after that (who were Korean), and the server finally looks over and I told her party of 4. She ignores me and takes the group of 8 behind me. I looked at her in disbelief confronted her that we were waiting first. She finally seats us next to the door. Then they made us wait 20 minutes before giving us a menu and asking what we would like to drink. I will never go back. JIN MEE's restaurant is way better!!!I left cold, hungry and penniless.My friends and I were in the mood for AYCE Koren BBQ and this place was on my must try list.  Upon walking through the door, we were promptly greeted, seated toward the front of the restaurant, received a pitcher of water and a couple menus.  Within minutes we ordered the pork belly, spicy pork belly, kalbi and the boneless sirloin (I forget what it's called) all off the AYCE menu.The waitress came back with our four different banchan, the sirloin and put kim chee, sprouts and pork belly on the grill.  From there it all went downhill...slowly.  We devoured the pork belly, but the lady had turned the fire off so we kind of just sat there wondering what we should do.  Meanwhile, every time people came through the front door, it wouldn't close.  Which meant the frigid night air was blowing right on us and other tables seated near the front.  Without complaining, we kept standing up to close it.  You'd think that after about 20 times of doing this (along with the other table near us) some employee would have seen us and offered to fix it.  But you'd be wrong.  Finally, a nice waitress [the only nice one?] came by and we immediately bombarded her with requests: if she could somehow fix the door; please start the fire again; could we get more food, water and banchan; and we asked for steamed rice.  It took about 15 minutes before ANYONE came within earshot of our table.  Why on earth would it take 15 minutes to get water refilled, let alone more food?  This is a restaurant, right?  They serve food here, right?  Regardless, we were finally able to defrost and we finally had some food and water!  Woo hoo!  Warning: buzz kill coming.  About halfway through the sirloin, we started wondering when the rest of our food was coming.  And we kept wondering until one of my friends stood up, walked to the counter and ASKED for food: kalbi, spicy pork belly and more rice.  Shortly thereafter, the spicy pork arrived...but no rice.  Not so shortly thereafter, my friend had to STAND UP AGAIN AND ASK for the kalbi.  This time we tried to be smart about it and order three orders.  Nope, they said.  We could only have ONE order per table.  Um, hello, the menu does say one order, but it's one per person.  Regardless, we were hungry and tired of waiting so we took what we could get...but no rice.After finishing the one order of kalbi, we still wanted more.  However, having sat there for more than 2 hours and having only four small orders delivered, we were fed up of not being fed.  We were tired, frustrated, cold (they turned off the heat again) and the servers were avoiding eye contact with us.  In fact, they didn't even drop the bill.  We had to walk up to the counter and ASK FOR OUR BILL!!!  Talk about insult to injury!  Having been near the door, we could have just walked out without paying and no one would have noticed us gone.    However, being people of principle, we paid our $60+ dollars for the "food."  Then we left...to go eat somewhere else.  Despite having AYCE, we were STILL HUNGRY!!!We were so excited to come here because the one in LA is really good and had pretty good reviews on here. But we were sorely disappointed in the customer service and AYCE policy.  The food tasted okay for the most part though. It is located in a plaza in Chinatown, not on the LV Strip.  We got here about 8 pm and there was no wait.  When we got to our table, we noticed this huge domed grill, it looked like a lid or an overturned wok.  It was cool.  We ended up with AYCE for our group of 6 at $19.99 each.  When we proceeded to order our favorites, we were told we can only order 2 items at a time.  We are used to limited items, but usually 4-5, which was fine.  After we cooked the first batch, they told us we had to finish everything before they would take our order for the next round.  Our grill was sitting there empty while we were starving & waiting for our food to be brought out by the wait staff.  Other tables had full grills most of the time, while we sat there with nothing on ours.  We ordered different items on the menu including:beef tongue - good, thin sliced meatspicy octopus - quarter sized when cooked, was okaykalbi (short ribs) - marinated fatty meat, not great :(sides - not so fresh, marinated cucumbers had a weird flavordipping sauces - did not look appetizing eitherspicy "bulgogi" (brisket) - kinda weird looking...  this did not look like our usual bulgogi, so we asked about it.  Us:  What is that? (as we pointed to it cooking on the grill)Waiter:  It's spicy bulgogiUs:  It doesn't look like bulgogiWaiter:  It's brisket with other meats all clumped togetherUs:  Huh?Waiter:  It has other meats and brisket mixed togetherUs:  (We still had quote bubbles with question marks)  I just looks like pork, didn't we order brisket?We would have tried other meats, but we were only "allowed" to eat so much due to being micro-managed by the waiter/waitress not giving us our food.After we got on our car and started pulling away, the 2 servers ran up to our car saying they charged the wrong amount.  Even though they charged the wrong amount, we totaled it correctly and made sure to tip.  I asked, did you even look at what we gave total?  He didn't and said, "oh, you paid the correct amount and tipped too?"  It made is feel like we were trying to not pay. Then complained we only gave $20 tip.I will give 3 stars for the flavors of the meats & sides, but need to take 2 stars off for service.I would suggest to order from the menu a la carte instead of AYCE, you'll probably be more satisfied.  We probably would have been charged half the price considering how much we ate, actually it was more like how much they wanted to give us.If you want to be micromanaged when eating, having someone tell you how much to eat at an AYCE place and getting a smirk for "only" giving $20 tip, then come here.  Otherwise, there are so many other buffets in Vegas that are so much more worth it.  The AYCE Korean BBQs in Los Angeles are SO MUCH BETTER, food-wise and service wise.  The waitstaff need to go to Customer Service 101 classes.Note:  This is my 1st less than 3 star review out of 80 that I've written.  Definitely not worth it for the service as others have said.  Disappointed!  :(As many of my yelp friends know, I am still an activist for anti-discrimination of Asian-Americans. Many of the top Asian-American elitists who are members of our organization meet together once a month. 99% of the the time we meet at either Sushi on Rainbow or HONEY PIG. It's just become our spot to discuss business. Also, we consider the honorable Mr. Jake Lee to be quite a respected figure in the LV Asian-American community, so we eat here to show our respects to him. Mr. Lee is so respected that even the Japanese members of our agency see him as a great role model for their community.I'm a Yakiniku guy. But, HONEY PIG is the only Korean BBQ that I would prefer over Yakiniku(for those of you who do not know, Yakiniku is the Japanese variation of Korean BBQ). Yakiniku restaurants are known for using very high quality meats, but the beef at HONEY PIG is much more tender and higher in quality than even the most expensive Yakiniku joints in San Diego or LA.There are lots of really good choices here in LV for AYCE Korean BBQ, but they just can't compare to HONEY PIG. Sura is also a great choice, but it can't touch THE PIG.  Don't get me wrong, I love Sura and the service is really good but HONEY PIG just has much more superior quality meats and it's  always perfectly marinaded. I hate how at the other Korean BBQ joints in town, they rush the preparations and the meat does not have that full flavor of the marinade. You won't get that problem here at THE PIG.   Just to let you yelpers know, you can't satisfy Korean customers. You can bring your Korean friends to the best Korean restaurant in the world and they will still give it 1-star.  Korean's always compare restaurants to their mother's cooking and if it doesn't taste like Mom's kalbi then it officially "sucks" to them. So if you are Korean, then maybe don't come here. If you are Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, etc then come on over.  Some yelpers are claiming that the staff won't treat you well unless you are Korean. That's just not true. Most of us are very visibly Japanese, and we get VIP treatment.  I don't know, maybe they just treat us good because we spend so much money.  I mean, if you are Asian-American and your household doesn't have investments and assets worth at least over 1.5 million, you probably should be pretty embarrassed to call yourself Asian.Mr. Lee does a very good job with his restaurants. I see some people wondering if the HONEY PIG in Los Angeles is related to this location, and the answer is that his brother owns that one. All I can say is that I got nothing but respect for Mr. Lee and his HONEY PIG. What a great restaurant to have here in LV.So I've been meaning to write an update for Honey Pig. A few months ago I decided to give Honey Pig another chance, and I've been completely happy with the service since then! It has become my "regular" Korean bbq spot. Since I've been going there so much, they know me by now and are very much attentive whenever my boyfriend and I walk in. They immediately bring over the AYCE menu and the brisket dipping sauce that we love so much! (if you haven't tried it, be sure to ask for it, it tastes good with everything!) I honestly couldn't ask for better service. Also, their pork belly has defeated all other pork bellies in any other Korean bbq restaurant (for me at least). Last time I ordered pork belly at a Korean bbq restaurant in California, it tasted so bland and flavorless. Honey Pig's pork belly is so full of flavor that you almost feel like you just can't stop eating it. My boyfriend has even grown to love it, and he's not a big fan of pork belly.If you are in Vegas and looking for a great AYCE Korean bbq  restaurant, this is your place. AYCE is served until 10 pm, but as long as you get there before 10, they'll serve you past that time.This place jumps all over with me. Hit or miss. Was victim of some bamboozlement a few visits ago, but I think the last visit made up for it. If you've been here before and the menu seems a little fishy, demand for the LOCAL MENU!!! I'll leave it at that...Had some visitors from Minnesota during our cold front. Two were noobs and the other two were well experienced Korean BBQ specialists. We all jump on the AYCE menu. Banchan sides were set with a bunch of garlic and jalapeno peppers.                     (please forgive me if I spelled the food incorrectly)Round 1:Beef brisket (Chadol Baegi) and beef tongue (Gyutan). It's what's for dinner. Noobies weren't big fans of the beef tongue. Both tasted good, although I prefer the brisket over anything that can taste me back.Round 2, 3, & 4:Pork Belly (Samgyeopsal). This was THE BUSINESS!!! These cuts were GIANORMOUS!!! Even the noobies were in awe by the majestic slabs of pork belly staring them in their eyes. PORK BELLY GET IN MY BELLY!!! Round 5: Marinated beef short ribs (Galbi). We finished off the feeding with something marinated. Not that big of a fan, but it was good. I'll pho'ks with it. Honey Pig's brisket and pork belly got me hooked again. Only time will tell if they can stay consistent. We've been lucky to keep getting the same waitress which is on top of her game. I'll be watching for anymore bamboozlement. YAY! I'M A FAN!!!I am conflicted on how to rate Honey Pig. I liked the quality of the meat and the fact that they basically cook everything for you. What I am not a huge fan of is how understaffed they are, the upcharge on items without notice, the lack of kalbi during lunch, and the limitation of it on dinner. We rolled in as a large party of 10 and sat in the back. It took some time for the lady to get to us and start the grill. Half our party was eating while the rest of us were waiting to start. When we began, we were happy with the food for the most part. The meat could have used some seasoning if the sesame oil dipping sauce was not to come with salt. The marinated meat just tasted too sweet.Once we got started, the attendant started to loosen up. We didn't eat that much and asked for the bill halfway through. It threw her off and she kept offering to bring out more food if we needed. Overall, she was rather nice, but we all had to get to work or do errands. Honey Pig was decent, but I have other places I would go first if the need for Korean BBQ hits.I went here for lunch and didn't want to go for AYCE. I was just in the mood for some kimchi and Korean BBQ and Yelp kept telling me I needed to go here. So here I went.I walked in and the place was empty. Just two waitresses and they looked at me like I was crazy when I said it was only a party of one. My waitress sat me and gave me a menu but didn't ask me if I wanted anything to drink. When she took my order, she still didn't ask me if I wanted anything to drink. My food came out and she still didn't ask me if I wanted anything. I had to finally ask her. After that I never saw her again, until it was time for me to pay. So I think I can also confirm that the service here is spotty. Maybe they just don't care to be nice. However, my food made up for the experience. It was about $12 before tax and tip. I ordered a lunch plate with meat and noodles and it was good. I really did enjoy my lunch. I left satisfied and full but with the crappy service, I just don't know if I would return.This used to be my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ spot but unfortunately they've raised their prices and shrunk the menu :( You can't do both and expect people to still love you the same!! They have also cut down on the Banchan dishes that they give out as well as the salad. There used to be a variety of greens but now it is just lettuce. BOOTheir service is not to be praised or frowned upon. They will get to you in a timely manner and your initial order of meat will arrive shortly BUT you will not see them much afterwards. It does not matter if they are busy or slow. Their food makes up for everything else. Their pork belly is very good! Probably my favorite out of all the spots I've tried in town. After seeing that their prices have gone up and their menu has shrunk but service has not improved to make up for these factors...I will probably choose to go elsewhere if I am craving Korean BBQFirst problem....they wouldn't up charge us for the honey pig, instead of the Korean pork belly! This is odd because I was happy to pay whatever the difference was between the two! Next, I ask to switch the brisket for the bulgogi...this was also shot down! Both dishes are the EXACT SAME PRICE on their menu! So then I asked why this wasn't allowed...she said because it just wasn't allowed. Soooooo it's not allowed to make ANY CHANGES to a combo...even if it would make the combo more expensive? Smh...bad management! I'm trying to spend more money and buy more products from your business and you can't even explain why substituting isn't allowed? Every waitress in there was rude and acted as if they were slammed...lmao there was three occupied tables and three waitresses!?! It was Wednesday at 10:30pm....I'll take my business to Pho So 1 the next time I'm in that shopping complex!Honey Pig is still one of my favorite Korean BBQ joints in Vegas. The servers are super friendly and frequently check on their customers to see if they need anything. The seafood soon dubu here is one of the best you can order besides the restaurants in korea town L.A. I also recommend the honey comb pork and spicy pork which you can cook yourself on the table or have them cook it for you in the kitchen. All the banchan at Honey Pig is delicious, especially the soy marinated potatoes and fish cake. I believe they have raised all the menu prices not too long ago and it is a little overpriced in my opinion, but I still find myself eating here at least once a month!I'm a little perplexed at this "3 stars average rating" nonsense. Honey Pig is clearly better than that.It's been quite some time since I've done Korean BBQ in Vegas, but there's no way a meat eater can resist a friend's invitation to feast. We arrived around 6pm on a Friday night and beat the dinner rush handily. Our chairs were placed fairly close to each other on purpose, as we would learn later.It was fairly obvious from the a la carte pricing that AYCE ($24.95 all-you-can-eat dinner, supposedly a 2 hour limit, but we didn't reach it) would be the way to go for variety's sake. Late night diners should be aware that although this restaurant is open 24/7, AYCE is only available until 10pm. While they only allow a maximum of one portion of kalbi (beef short ribs) and one portion of beef sirloin with AYCE, the other options (bulgogi, pork belly, spicy pork belly, spicy squid, spicy chicken) are truly unlimited as long as you don't over-order.Before the first round, they brought out banchan (the ubiquitous sides in Korean cuisine), which consist of bean sprouts, mini seafood pancakes, pickled veggies, and spicy cucumbers. The table space is essentially a circular ring that surrounds the circular grill, so the banchan were placed between the two of us. They also provided three dipping sauces (my simplistic summary: one salty, one sweet, and one spicy) and bowls of white rice.For the actual first round, they threw kimchi and bean sprouts onto the grill along with bulgogi, then pork belly after the bulgogi had finished. They staged this on the opposite side of the circular ring so that they didn't get in our way. I wouldn't say that they totally follow through on the cooking process, but they will come back to turn the meat. Still, it feels like you can chopstick your way through it at any time and pull beef early to your liking, and that's a good thing. You should know that the outer edge of the grill will cook things more slowly, so relocate food there to avoid overcooking.Anyway, the bulgogi and pork belly were both good, although I personally preferred the somewhat fatty pork belly. The sweet dipping sauce worked best with both, but I played around for variety's sake.We wanted the kalbi and the beef sirloin for the second round, and they obliged. Both were actually marinated, and both stay pretty tender as long as you don't leave them on the grill for far too long. Yeah, we may have succumbed to this oversight. At least the properly cooked pieces tasted great!Lastly, we had spicy chicken and also convinced them to mix it into an order of fried rice (+$2.95 per person). This fried rice is exciting because they cook it on the grill to pick up the meaty residues of the preceding deliciousness. It was certainly delicious overall. I'll admit that the spicy chicken and the leftover kimchi were a bit intense for me at first, but they were easier to handle once they'd cooled from hot to merely warm. Synergistic heat effects, you know. Anyway, they did allow us to box the leftovers of the fried rice (containing some chicken at this point) to go, and having food for the next day feels like more value than even taking the time to stuff yourself that night.Nothing was totally mindblowing, but everything tasted very good, so why not 5 stars? Well, this is a bit nitpicky, but I'm disappointed with the limit on two types of especially delicious meat. It's understandable since some people can go absolutely H.A.M. on the food, but most places don't have that limit. Then again, my somewhat distant memories give me the impression that most AYCE places offer lower-quality meats. There is a second issue, however, in the lack of attention to giving more banchan. No server offered to bring more banchan, and one server outright said OK to more seafood pancakes, but never brought seconds.I'll have to eat around more to make a more informed comparison, but I'm very comfortable giving Honey Pig 4 stars and decrying the ridiculous underrating by the "average Yelper."

I'm not sure why I've been to this restaurant more than once.  My last experience is how I decided to give it a 2-star, maybe I would have given them a 3-star based on prior visits. (At first I was tempted to give it a 1-star but I reserve that rating for visible creepy crawlers, etc.)630 - We arrive to make sure we are in time for Happy Hour. 645 - Our order was taken 653 - Edamame and salad arrive (no utensils, napkins, water or beer).  The lower into the bowl of Edamame we get, the less fresh they taste. 655 - Napkins and utensils arrive.  We ask about our beer and water (it's Happy Hour, remember?!)658 - Water arrives, Happy Hour is over so they take away the menu.702 - Beer arrives (Where are their priorities?)Then sushi arrives and it's mediocre or even worse than mediocre.  Maybe I should say, you get what you pay for?Definitely not going back here.

Dear Gourmandise,I love you.  With the fire of a thousand suns.Gourmandise is a cute, quirky bistro in downtown Urbana, and they have made my breakfast mornings immeasurably better multiple times now.The first time, I had a bacon breakfast sandwich on a croissant.  Magnificent.  The next time?  The petite omelette special, which is a delicious omelette with bacon and potatoes and cheese (nicely small-sized), paired with a tasty mini roll and a piping hot cup of coffee.  Goodness.Their coffee is the best I've had at any restaurant/eatery in C-U so far, as well.  The staff (I believe the gentleman that owns the place), is extraordinarily friendly and wonderfully engaging.Now, the only thing that confuses/amuses me.  With a name like La Gourmandise, you expect some Francophone schtick.  But when you walk in, there are scenes depicting German country life, and a plethora of German inspired foods as well.  However, another wall sports French art kitsch.  WHERE ARE WE?I've concluded that Gourmandise must be in some tiny spot on the French German border.  Or just Strasbourg.  Whatevs. Delicious.  Go now.

Based on everybody's reviews, I HAD to try this place out.  I mean really HAD to.  I'm Chinese so I KNOW Chinese food and there's not a whole lot of places to go that's decent on our side of town.  So it's still a good 15-20 miles away from us but we were in the neighborhood so we decided to give it a try.  WOW!Granted, not the best Chinese food I ever had but definitely the best I've had in the West Valley.  I would say if it were in any other place like NY, LA, Houston, I would have given it 3 stars but for Phoenix, definitely 4.  The service was also very good, which you don't usually see in Chinese restaurants.  I ain't hatin' either - it's just the way it is.  :)We  had the Beef Chow Fun, Honey Walnut Shrimp, and Crispy Orange Beef.  The COB wasn't very spicy which was fine by us, but had a nice sweet tangy flavor to it.  It didn't taste like it had much of a layer on it - almost like they  just fried the beef - but it tasted pretty good.  Never eaten it that way before.The HWS had huge shrimp but not a whole lot of it.  Which was fine.  I thought the mayo sort of overpowered the whole dish but it was still better than any other place I've had in the Valley.  Finally, the BCF was the best dish.  I'm a fan of big noodles and they did a good job with the flavoring.We really enjoyed our meal here and will definitely come again.  All the flavoring in their food was pretty good, if not awesome.  Not super salty like Pei Wei can be (my I-don't-have-any-other-choice-but-to-come-here option) but rather just the right touch.  When we got there, pretty much all their tables were full and the conversations I heard several of the patrons had with the waiters/waitress was, "Thanks for coming again, see you next week/time."  DEFINITELY a good sign.  We weren't disappointed!Restaurant week with my mom continued tonight.  She likes Chinese food and this place is only about 5 minutes away from our house.  Seemed like a good time to head on over.  We went inside and were seated immediately.  As soon as I sat down, I felt a little anxiety.  They do a bustling take out business but their waiting area is very tiny and it was right next to our table.  It felt like people were on top of us the whole time.  Every time you would lift your head, someone was there or looking your way.  A little bit uncomfortable.  If there is a next time, hopefully we will sit someone against the wall or something.  Anyways..........placed our order for Diet Cokes and actually used the Yelp check-in app in order to score us 2 free egg rolls!  We decided to go with Mongolian Beef and Orange Peel Chicken.  Here is how everything tasted...............Egg Rolls-  Best part of the meal, by far!  There were 2 of them and you could tell they were homemade and they tasted great.  They are served with a little sweet and sour sauce with a pinch of hot mustard.  The egg rolls and sauce were delicious.  They were hot, fresh, crispy and hearty for being such small things.  I would definitely get them again and maybe even a few orders of them  in addition to the free one you get from the Yelp app. Mongolian Beef-  This was presented nicely with a ton of onions and beef.  I am spoiled though and am used to certain kinds of Chinese food (Golden Chopsticks in National City rings a bell).  I dug in to this and it tasted ok.  The meat was a little tough though and could have been seasoned just a bit more.  Not bad in any way, just nothing compared to other places that I have had Mongolian Beef before.  Portion size seemed just a bit skimp too.  Overall, it was just ok.Orange Peel Chicken-  Once again, I am used to certain things when it comes to Chinese food and this was totally different.  Their Orange Chicken is basically a breaded chicken breast cut up into strips a la chicken katsu.  It was covered in a sweet tasting sauce that was just ok.  The breading on the chicken fell off pretty easily which was kind of annoying.  Once again, the portion was a tad skimp.White Rice-  Rice was ok.  They give you a huge container of it at least.Overall, everything was just alright.  We ate all the food presented to us and didn't have any leftovers (rare with Chinese food...it boils down to the kind of skimp portions though) and were not totally stuffed to the brim.  Service, while friendly, was a tad slow.  Will I come back?  Eh...possibly.  My wife doesn't eat Chinese food other than Pick Up Stix and PF Changs, so I will probably be rolling solo if I do come back.  Nothing was really bad, but nothing stood out as super delicious either.  A-OK about sums it up....maybe even on the low end of A-OK.  Total bill for everything including tip was around $30.00.  Fair enough I guess.

Restaurant name  The Codfather

Review Text :
Wow, I came on here to send a link about this place to a friend and was surprised to see so many neg reviews.  My family moved over here from Yorkshire, in the UK, when I was a kid and has been on the look out for good fish and chips ever since!  The Codfather is the first place in 25 years that passed muster.  My folks drive miles all the way from the East Valley to go to this place and I drive up from central Phoenix to join them.  Yorkshire could be considered the epicenter of the fish and chip addicted Brit and even gets riffed on for it.  The couple that own this place imported their fryer equipment and alot of their ingredients from the UK - they even have haddock on the menu which you NEVER see anywhere out here (haddock is a flaky north atlantic white fish that is superior to cod - do not get cod if you can have haddock instead).As I read the neg reviews I realize most of them appear to be reviewing the type of food vs. the restaurant. Its like giving a bad review to an Indian restaurant if you don't like Indian food - not cool.Yes, its a hole in the wall and the owner is a no-nonsense Londoner, and yes, NEWSFLASH: fried food is greasy!  But these are the best authentic British fish and chips you will get.  If you don't like that type of food, don't slam a (small, hard working, family run) restaurant thats doing a really good job at it.Some educational tidbits for the uninitiated:1.They serve chips not fries - chips are soft not crisp2. Ask for/try HP sauce with it - thats what many Brits prefer over ketchup3. Don't get it to go if you can avoid it- the heat of the food in the container continues to steam the food and its not as good (or the batter as crisp) when you get it home4. In the Northern UK you primarily get haddock, in the south its mostly cod, which is greasier - try haddock if you've never had it.5. The reason vinegar is typically applied to fish and chips is to cut the grease - give it a whirlI was born & raised in New England, Moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, visited the UK  and later lived on Maui ,Hawaii so I know good fish & chips. I can speak with some authority when I say here in Phoenix good fish & chips is hard to find. The good news is The Codfather Fish and chips is the way it was meant to be made.  A large crispy coating, and fries deep fried to perfection.  If you are looking for this classic dish, you will not find a better place than the Codfather. GIANT piece of fried fish and it was delicious. Crispy, soft, juicy, flavourful, perfect with a little vinegar. Amazingly delicious. the chips were golden, fluffy, crispy on the outside but not so much that they can't absorb a generous amount of malt vinegar. For the price, could you really ask for moreMy wife & I ordered the cod, which was a HUGE portion and a side of large chips.  The cod was breaded and cooked to a perfectly crispy and crunchy consistency, while still maintaining the moist fish.   FOOD: I ordered the cod, which was a HUGE portion and a side of large chips.  The cod was breaded and cooked to a perfectly crispy and crunchy consistency, while still maintaining the moist fish. I can say that the fish was fresh and the oil that it was cooked in was clean. The fish was fresh as it didn't taste fishy. The fries were lightly fried and it didn't taste too oily which was a good thing. The The chips were delicious ! PRICE: For the price, could you really ask for more.CONCLUSION:  Grab that malt vinegar and pour it on, because this fish and chip stop is the one to enjoy.Been here a few times in the past. Once when they first opened. On my last visit the place was bigger and now serving alcohol. Maybe that is the best way to enjoy this place to the fullest?This is a British style restaurant with Fish and Chips the way they make it back home. My Son-in-law is from England and he LOVES this place. They have several popular items that you would get overseas. Mushy Peas, Bangers / Mash / Gravy, Bubble/Bangers/Beans and many others.Inside is decorated with everything you would expect if you were vacationing in GB. They also have a nice market with items that you may not find in your typical grocery store.We have had the Cod, Haddock, Jalapeno Poppers (LOL) and looking forward to possibly trying the Walleye in a future lifetime.The food is somewhat bland tasting to my palate. Maybe that is how they like it over there. The fish seems a little more greasy than we would prefer and a napkin is needed to soak up the excess. Hmmm?Service is friendly and the dining experience and menu are worth checking out. Would have to say that there are better places for Fish in my opinion. But then again ... this is how they do it over in the Queen's backyard. TALLY HO!3 STARS

I kept driving by and seeing a sign "Summer Special - Two meals, salad and wine for $40" I had heard decent reviews about this place so we decided to give it a try this week.I was impressed to hear you could choose ANY item on the menu for your salad and entrees; you weren't limited to a smaller selection. We ordered the following:LINGUINE FRUTTI DI MARE ~ Mussels, calamari, shrimps, with Fra Diavolo sauce ($19.95)MELANZANE PARMIGIANA*~ Layers of eggplant with mozzarella, tomato and parmesan ($14.95)2 Salads ($9)Bottle of Sangiovese 'Polesio' ($34)With tax and tip this meal would have been around $100, so walking out paying about half that made for a great dining experience. The food was very authentic, it tasted like you had just stepped in to an old Italian grannies kitchen. The bread was fresh and the ambiance romantic. I'm going with 4 stars, but honestly if we had paid full price, it would probably only be 3.. (Oh and they really should spruce up the bathrooms, they were gross).

I actually just left the restaurant. Me and three of my friends all went to the restaurant for the first time. It was tiny and very cramped. I actually got elbowed in the head twice by servers. It was also extremely loud! I ordered a ceasar salad. I get the bill and its 16.95 for a salad and water!!! The menu specifically says 6.95. But somehow I'm getting charged 10 dollars extra! So I bring it up and ask why I'm getting charged so much. Apparently I got served a "DINNER" salad even though I ordered a regular salad. I told the server this as well as an older lady, short, redish curly hair, accent, very rude that I was over charged. The server failed to ask and tell me that I was getting a dinner portion even though the menu says NOWHERE that that it what you will get no matter what. The older lady told me that its dinner time so that is what I get. I went on to tell her that that is not what I ordered and that the menu says ceasar salad 6.95. She began talking in circles saying everything over and over again. She blamed everything on the server who was nice just failed to tell me. She also told me that it was my fault because I ate the salad. Yes, really. She told me it was my fault. She said that I did not complain so it's my problem. She also said "You know what, your right mammi. It is my fault because this is not McDonald's and that is where you should be eating." Yep. She actually said that to a customer. I told the waiter that it was not his fault and told her that I would never be eating there again. I never will. I ended up paying 20 dollars for a salad, and to be honest, not a very good one. I'm still fuming at the fact that someone actually said that to me. It's not about the money, it's about what I ordered and what I was sneakily being charged for and when I asked about it I got yelled at. Classy

Holy Elephant Balls, Buddha! This place is incurrydible!!! Okay, okay I'll stop.So my wife and I decided to hook up for lunch.  She works downtown so I decided to head down that way and pick her up.  I suggested Thai Elephant because I had never been, and she raved about the Pad Thai she had ordered a couple weeks ago.  It's located on Adams just West of Central Ave., and parking is scarce.  Make sure to have some change for the meter!I knew I was at home when I saw the "People Love Us On Yelp" sticker on their door.  It was about 1 pm so the lunch crowd wasn't in FULL effect.  There were about 10 empty tables in which we had our pick. We sat by the window.  My wife ordered the Drunken Noodles with Chicken (a la medium), and I ordered the Green Curry with Chicken (a la medium).  A round of Thai Tea was also added to the bill.  Our food came out in about 4 minutes, which came as a shocker! Yes, I said shocker... I was pleasantly surprised!The moment I slammed my chompers onto the emerald dripping chicken, I became green with envy. Envious of all the people who have eaten here in the past and had such a precious secret hidden up their sleeves.  I sniffled a bit, but not from emotion.  It was the green curry and its beautiful spices stroking my mucus glands in just the right way.  A bit of rice and a sip of the Thai Tea (I'll get into in a second) and I was right back on track.The Thai Tea. Ooohhhh, the Thai Tea!  It was $2.50 and twice as large as the ones I order from The Street.  It was like being chosen by Ganghis Khan to sit alongside him in Xanadu and drink the Milk of Paradise (Rush Reference).  It was sweet, as you would expect paradise to be, and creamy. I began to float out of my chair and harpies wiped my nose as I sipped the golden brown goblet of goodness.Service was SpectacularFood was FabulousPortions were PhenomenalDare I say it? 5 Big Ones, Mr. Elephant... and I shall return!While waiting for Ayesha to have dinner at Thai Elephant, I tried not to let the meth-crack-head who pretended to talk on the pay phone deter me from a great meal.  She had no shoes on and walked up to the pay phone and started talking.  It hadn't been ringing and she didn't dial a number.  I'm a sucker for Touch of Thai's catfish dish, and they had the same one on the menu.  It was good, but the fish was a bit overcooked.  I would have liked a bit more "sauce" as the dish was a bit dry.Service was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without asking throughout our meal.Of course, spending and evening with Ayesha over spicy food as we both wiped our noses from the heat of curry can't be beat!service - great, fast, nice and consistent. split our check, no prob, knew answers to questions about what goes in their sauces without having to go to the kitchen and ask, and high tailed it when we realized we had to rush out the door to make our show time. also had our table reserved (really, with a sign and everything) and ready to go when we walked in at our reservation time. (take that, wild thaiger)location - right in the heart of downtown. walking distance to phx symphony hall (which was why we chose it as our pre-show dining spot) and nestled among the businesses so i'm sure is hopping come noon.ambiance - intimate and on the casual side but with nice touches like dark wood accents. i would have preferred the flat screen in the corner playing news be off, along with the volume (it was dinner time, after all, not a rushed business lunch) and some music instead, but it was only a mild annoyance.food - i loved my yellow curry. it was sweet and savory and spicy (not hot spicy, but flavorful spicy) and fresh and delicious. portions were huge, and well priced. i wish i could recall the name of the entree my friend got, but it came out with three - yes, three -- chicken breasts! my leftovers were enough for two more meals. a great menu that would fly with kids and less adventurous diners and with thai food appreciators.misc - hours could be longer. i'm sure it brings in more $$ as a lunch spot, but i would come to dinner more often if they were open later. and they close from like 3 to 5. no full bar - beer and wine only.overall: very pleased, wish i had come over a year ago when i first heard about it. oh wait, i tried twice and was twice thwarted by their hours!While I am no Thai expert, I do eat Thai food a lot, and I can speak a little bit, and I'll be going to Thailand in December, so I think it stands to reason that I know what I'm talking about.Thai Elephant is delicious. Tom Kah with Tofu. Drunken Noodles with Tofu. Drunken Fried Rice with Tofu. Yellow Curry with Tofu. Siamese Basil with Tofu. All amazing.I have been to the Tempe location probably 20 times, and I like it better because 1) I don't have to feed the meter like at this downtown location 2) the facilities are a little nicer 3) its bigger and 4) the service is a little better, but overall this location is pretty good.Cob Coon, Ka for reading!

I was on a grease roll and didn't pretend to be healthy yesterday.I ordered the 3 pieces (I should order 2 next time!) with the dirty rice and a side of warm mouth watering (and melting) biscuit. The biscuit is so much better than something out of KFC but I am sure they used so much more butter! The chicken was crispy and the meat was so moist! The skin was not a thick load of batter like some fried chicken can get and the spice was just right. Till next time, Bojangles!You might not be aware, but Bojangles is based right here in Charlotte and so this location is quite the flagship to introduce this fabulous chicken to people who otherwise might not be able to experience it.This one is located by gate B9 and there is a small seating area nearby. Do your fellow passengers a big favor and PLEASE DO NOT BRING FRIED CHICKEN ON THE PLANE. Sure, it tastes great for you, but the smell carries for miles and miles. So yes, get some of this great stuff. And then eat it in the airport!Okay, enough ranting. I got a simple platter with a breast and a wing plus mashed potatoes and cole slaw. I'm not going to have their mac & cheese in the airport, but at the retail outlets, it's okay. The chicken was quite moist but there was a lot of batter. The fixin's were okay. Nothing specialI can't say that I'm blown away by Bojangles, but it's one of those things that I generally have about once a year.For a laugh, pronounce it "Bo-HANG-glaze".

Inner Vietnamese woman strikes again!Who knew that a Vietnamese place can have an upscale feel while still being delicious? The Mr and I finally visited this place and both were pretty much blown away by the space and the food, this certainly raises the ante for the already established Vietnamese places. Since we have never been before we ordered our asses off the smallish but well written menu. Started with Egg Rolls, these were top drawer complete with fresh lettuce and mint to wrap and dip into the Nc chm, amazingly delicious, fresh and piping hot against the cool veggies.. seriously, food like this can make you horny! Next up was the Hai nam chicken also known as chicken rice.. outstanding garlic rice with boiled chicken and a ginger dipping sauce. Each bite can be customized with chili and ginger sauce, my mouth is watering just thinking about this dish!! Bò Kho is one of my all time favorite Vietnamese dishes. If you arent familiar its basically a wonderful beef stew with either noodles or french bread. The Pho Ao Sen version is one of the best versions in the valley. You can tell this one is made form scratch, not from a base like other cheater versions around the valley. Each bite was thick and rich with nice pieces of fatty beef and carrot. I only wish they would have added some potato though the egg noodles were just fine by me! Now what is going to a Vietnamese place without ordering Bun Cha Ha Noi? Pho Ao Sen makes one of the most elegant version Ive seen with a compartmentalized plate showing off each component. This plate both brought us to ooo's and ahhh's.. then the fun begins assembling the rice noodles, bbq pork and the various fresh veggies into a lettuce leaf.. each bite was different from the last by using Nc chm, chile, and hoisen sauce. Simple and delicious!!Unfortunately we did not see that they serve wine or beer which would have made this place a perfect destination. However they have a nice selection of different beverages including one of my favorites Thai Tea. Sweetened tea topped with milk while basic is great at putting out the chile fires in your mouth! We also tried something we never had before.. Soda Sa Ht Gà which essentially is Vietnamese style eggnog. Egg yolk, sweetened condensed milk, and club soda make for a refreshing and interesting beverage choice. Come on, go out on a limb and try it!!Pho Ao Sen is fantastically delicious and a new favorite of my inner Vietnamese woman, Ive been missing her greatly of late.

Waited in a long line of people.   This line moves one foot every ten minutes and I'm so hungry.   Service wasn't up to par.   Oooh my gosh!  All these people passing up our long line have silver cards.     These big spenders just fly right in, escorted by a manager.  Then after I git to the register, I find out I coulda went ta the front of the line too. I had a gold card.      Escorts / hostess look for empty tables for us    Plate of Shrimp, a plate of prime rib, a plate of dried up lamb, off I go to pig out.     Our left over dishes were piled high on the table..    Overall....food is average.      They need more cash register booths, so the lines move quicker.  .Buffet of Buffets Marathon - Stop #2 of 7 10:30 AMWe walked from Caesar's Palace to the Flamingo to make it to this stop on the BoB tour.  I was already beginning to feel stuffed from the Caesar's buffet, but charged ahead anyway.  The line here was a little longer than Caesar's, but we were seated promptly and had a nice view of the pool area where the Flamingos & Swans hung out.  I even saw a Black Swan....cool!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=auKWdF71D6A-MqzCJLsY-gThe 1st round we all went to the buffet near the entrance, which had standard breakfast offerings....we were a little disappointed that it was so small.  I grabbed a few Pastries, Eggs, Potatoes, and other stuff.  The food was so/so (2.5 Stars for this section)....then another Yelper Holly C said that there was a Crepe station in another room past the 1st buffet section....what?!  How did I miss that?!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=7yWOGpZ5VrHcpL2YWdcYnQI immediately went to investigate.....yes, there was another huge section of Desserts, a Crepe station, Chocolate Fountain, Donuts, and other goodies.  I ordered a Blueberry Crepe from the nice woman working the station.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=UIQgmkOtmg22t5-_inbfwwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=xbMwXlp78c3N82SeqQxvjwShe was very pleasant and curious about what we were doing with attempting to eat at all 7 Buffets in one day.  She did a good job on the Crepe, which tasted awesome.  The other Desserts in the area were very good (4 Stars for this section).....but it really started to fill me up.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=J0YxypAGNZJLQZA9yc_rVAJust when we thought we saw it all, we discovered that there was a 3rd section of the Buffet!!!  There's a Chinese food section that opens at 11 am....I was done, but a few of the Yelpers I was with went to check it out and said it was very very good.Overall, this was a hidden gem surprise as we had low expectations for this buffet.  I wish I would have paced myself better so I could try the Chinese food....next time.  3 Stars weighted average for the Desserts and 1st section of the Buffet.  Incomplete on the Chinese food for me because I didn't have any.....other Yelpers loved it.Return Factor - 72%It was NOT my decision to come here, I just want to make that clear before I start this review!! I'm going to keep this review relatively short because I don't have anything nice to say about this place. Variety of foods, NOT impressed at all. In fact, it was kind of depressing seeing that this was all they had even though it was lunchtime. The food was so very disappointing and even saying that is an understatement. The desserts were cute, that's one nice thing I have to say BUT I took a big spoonful of one of the desserts, ONE bite and that thing came flying out into a napkin. It  was so disgusting that I actually gagged and sat there for a couple of minutes and tried to keep myself from throwing up.Cost around $16 for lunch, sure it's "cheap" but save your stomach and please choose another buffet to eat at. I knew I should have checked yelp before agreeing to come here!!!A buffet with a view, that's the extent of Paradise Garden. That view is strictly a daytime thing, so it seems a majority of the patrons are here for lunch/brunch. It's a run of the mill Vegas buffet, with some interesting items, but is an overall lackluster experience.First timers here might find the space impressive because it is. There aren't many midstrip lower end properties that will offer a spread like this, let alone with views of a vibrant garden. That's essentially the bread and butter of the experience because the options and quality of the food are subpar enough to have folks second guessing their visit.During the brunch hour, there is a bottomless mimosa option, which is an attractive option for the weekend warriors looking to continue their Saturday hangover. Another thing I didn't expect was the "Asian noodle" station, where one can customize their bowl of noodle soup. I made a killer wonton noodle soup - I'm still shocked. Their crepes station is also a semi-thumbs up, but it really depends on who's making them.The rest of the buffet is a tough to swallow. Literally. Anything fried is instant fail. The pizza is almost always a sure bet for a no-thank-you, most of the seafood is bland city, and if you're shooting for any of the BBQ or Mexican fare, then bless your appetite.Prices aren't backbreaking for a strip property at $24 for dinner and brunch. Other than that it's $15-20 for everything else. If you happen to be rockin the 24 hour pass, then consider passing on the Flamingo version of buffetland.How did I miss reviewing this place for so long?!?  I must be trippin' hard, but I digress.  This buffet is a blessed curse.  There is nothing that truly stands out about the buffet itself outside of sheer volume of choices on the first go around.  Please note that I hate going to a buffet and not having access to filling up my drink myself because I do not like not leaving a tip for the waiter or waitress, but sometimes my cup sits empty for an extended period of time.  Tips should be earned, and not just expected...my personal issue though.When you are first given the clearance to go inside this eatery, and are escorted to your seat by the hostess, you can't help but to notice the massive amount of food that you pass by on the way to your seat.  Once you are given clearance to eat, and given the information that a waiter will be over to take your drink order later, it is just a good idea to just go around and view everything that is offered.  Depending on the meal, you may have an omelet station or a pasta station or whatever!   Truly, there are a lot of options to choose from that ranges from sushi to sliders to carved this and curried that!  A massive salad bar with many options is located next to boiled shrimp and other seafood stuff.  Move over to the next island and you will see sliders, chicken sandwiches and subway sandwiches cut into palm size.  Move to another island and you have a choice of crepes.  Move to another island and you have a huge variety of sweets that includes cotton candy, fondue machines, many cakes and ice cream just to name some yums.  Truly, there is not stand out taste when it comes to this buffet.  Don't look for anything that will knock your taste buds socks off because that is not what this establishment is about.  This food-ship is strictly about shoveling massive amounts of items that you care to indulge into your pie hole often!  Find something that is good for that moment, and just go with that.  Try a little of each variety and leave full.  Just give them a try.  Make sure to ask about any discounts that are available with the buffet as well, which includes them being part of the eat at 6 buffets as often as you would like for 24 hours.Unfortunately this was one of the more terrible experiences I've had at a breakfast buffet in Las Vegas.  There wasn't a wait to get into this one and we were in a hurry.  Unfortunately, we paid the price for that in more ways than one.First, the cost - $25 per person.  Fairly standard, until you realize that they have seating for at least 400 people in the restaurant, which is usually half-filled, and only have one person pouring champagne, one person making omelettes, and then only one place to get hot food like eggs and bacon.So what happens when the place gets full, is that you wait sometimes up to 10 MINUTES IN LINE to get a spoonful of eggs, or a couple pieces of bacon!  Want a refill on champagne? Gotta wait 5 minutes! Clearly the funding for this buffet has been sharply reduced, or it never had much at all.Additionally, we decided to sit by the window next to what looked like a nice pond from a distance.  But when we sat down, it looked like the pond hadn't been cleaned in a very long time and there was a dead turtle floating in it!!!If you are reading this - heed my advice and give this place a miss!  You would be better off going to a Denny's or even McDonald's for that matter!  There is certainly no value here.Well, this is a strange buffet located at the oldest casino and hotel in the Las Vegas strip. Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet delivers some nearly average foods at an affordable prices. As my parents and I were nearly concluded the Vegas trip today, we decided to redeemed the last free buffet for 2 coupon offer after we signed two rewards cards a day ago.As we headed inside, the atmosphere is totally outdated and trippy. The decor, the concept are very 1970s to 1980s feel with the awkward design instead of being contemporary. It's like I'm dining inside Hometown Buffet mixed with Denny's touch.The service is not that bad as I welcome there. Some good; some not so good which they sometimes can't smiled at all. Otherwise, I believe they done a fine job here for making the customers approachable.Now onto the buffet entrees for me. My first plate is a simple lunch meal filled with smoked ham, jambalaya, green beans, baked tilapia, and Spanish rice. So far, it's a mediocre meal. The good ones that I enjoyed is the baked tilapia which it does taste ok to me. Also, the Spanish rice does tasted good too! The downside: the ham is nearly dried and bland after baking which it's left out the flavor. The jambalaya tasted too salty for me! I don't know why the jambalaya adds the ingredients too much! I wish it could reduce it and place natural flavors. The green beans is closely fair to me which I did feel eating it like coming from a frozen food which it did bought at the local supermarket.The second plate, is the BYO omelette. So far, it tasted closely average to me comparing to Hometown Buffet's BYO omelette, yet in a fine way. The omelette toppings that I added are spinach, bacon, and cheese. I wish it needs to make the flavors of the omelette more better, and fresher in my opinion before the doors open.My possible suggestions to improve Flamingo's Paradise Garden buffet is to redesign the concept to make it more contemporary feel instead of keeping the outdated old school formation. Secondary, this place needs to clean and sanitized! I've seen some of the dirty spots there near the dirty dishes collector side like wet towels placing down on the floor plus the seats too. Finally, make the foods fresh and new! I'm sure they need to make it something new instead of keeping the old ways like Hometown Buffet does. This is Vegas Strip Flamingo, and I'm sure they need to change their attitude to step it up.In the end, Flamingo's Paradise Garden buffet is a fairly Vegas buffet that my parents and I were dining this place for the first time. If you're likely and dare to come and dine there, good luck.

6:02 pm.. . tugging on the door handle only to realize that they close at 6pm! Lesson learned and I came back extra early the next day.My co-worker suggested that I come here for some goodies to bring home since this will probably be a rare occasion that I am in Wisconsin.Everyone says this is THE place to go for good Wisconsin cheese and cheeses that you can't find back at home.I ended up buying $20 of cheese that spoiled before I got home.  This was all my fault though. Nick (cutie at the counter) warned me that I should refrigerate the cheese.  Being the Asian that I am .. I figured that that it's like milk...you can keep it 3 days after the "suggested" date.  .  . .Pro:Drunken Goat CheeseA million varieties of cheeseGourmet top rated sandwichesWalking distance from the Capitol and DowntownCons:Still pretty pricey for cheese Cheese curds are not as great as ppl make them sound.If, like me, your goal is to eat your weight in cheese, then Fromagination is your kinda place. Any cheese your heart dreams of can likely be found here, and proudly made with Wisconsin love.In addition to many, many cheeses, they carry all kinds of crackers, jellies, mustards, barbecue sauces from Chicago's own Lillie's Q, Dean & Deluca products, spices, WI beers and wines, utensils and other accoutrements for maximum cheese eating pleasure, and also make sandwiches to go. We bought a ton of cheese and sat and ate our bounty on the lovely steps of the Capitol, which is close by.Fromagination is a cheese lover's paradise!Fromagination is an adorable boutique type shop that's straight out of my cheesiest dreams. The selection of cheese and cheese related items here is fantasmic. So. Much. Cheese. It doesn't just stop there though, they also have a nice selection of cured meats, cheese servingware, candies, dry snacks, jams, beer... and the list goes on. The store is tiny, but there are so many unique and cool things to oggle that you don't want to miss. That being said, it sucks that such a great, unique store lacks so much when it comes to customer service. The workers here give off a pretentious vibe and are very curt. I had a few questions and was looking for something in particular but it was impossible to get the attention of any of the staff. I guess having your back turned to the counter and unwrapping stuff is more important that focusing on customers in the store.I did end up choosing my own cheese and buying it, but the worker who rang me up wasn't very friendly and at that point I didn't feel comfortable trying to ask about anything else. Sorry for giving you my business? You'd think that a store that is so specialized with so much to offer would be more forthcoming with trying to educate customers so that they can really enjoy their products. Guess not. Good selection, but the experience is almost equivalent to going to the grocery store deli and picking out your own cheese. The customer service just doesn't exist here. Heck, the deli guy at the grocer's would probably be more friendly and I'd bet that it's probably cheaper there too.Knowing that our spring break hosts will expect cheese from us, coming from Wisconsin, we turned to this well-known spot for all things fromage. Our original mission was to ask if they had some nice cheese we could, say, bring in our carry on bags, and how long could it sit out in room temperature, but we were quickly derailed by the panoply of other edible and tasteful gifts lining the store. Though relatively smaller in space than I expected, we were able to browse unbothered, until we finally pulled it together to approach the counter. Our man behind the counter had all the answers we could hope for ("the FDA says 4-6 hours, but really any of the cheeses sitting out right now except those in the fresh case could handle the trip, especially in this weather") and was passionate ("really, these need to sit out for 30 minutes before consuming -- it's like wine it needs to decant...but I'm getting off topic"). Our answers satiated, we looked forward to coming back just before our trip to make the purchase, but lingered around a little longer. Suddenly he appeared with a board, no words, just two specially cut samples of cheese. We sampled those. Then we talked about the cheese. Then we looked at some more cheese. He asked if we wanted to try any of the other cheeses. We were indecisive; we are not the cheese experts, we thought, just the tasters. Without another word, he picked up a cheddar block (after I had poo poo'd on cheddar -- bold move) and cut us another two samples. This european cheddar, this was not your orangey, in your face cheddar. I changed my mind about cheddar at first crunch, and we had a short discussion on crystallization. We left with half of what was left of that cheddar and ate the whole thing that night, paired with a bottle of wine from Square Wine Co down the street.

Review Text :
You know, I have eaten at Liliana's many times and they have some very good food but I don't know that I've ever had worse service than what my family and I experience last night when we *tried* to enjoy a meal. Notice the emphasis on tried. From the very beginning, the service wasn't great. It took a long time to even get some water, much less some drinks. On top of that, we had to ask 4 times for a children's menu. We never received it and instead got a brief listing of some of the items on the children's menu.After finally getting our drinks, we ordered our meals. Our appetizers came out relatively quickly, as did the children's meal. Then, we waited. And waited. Then we start to notice food coming out to people who came in after us. Not only had we not seen our meals, but we also hadn't been offered drink refills. We asked our server what was going on. The first excuse was "I'm at the whim of the executive chef."   Oh, so the executive chef is determining who gets food and not the order that people ordered?  Interesting. So we wait some more.  More time goes by and we ask about our food again because now we're seeing people who came in 20-30 minutes after us paying their bill and leaving.  This time the server has no excuse or even an estimated timeline and instead offers us some drinks.  I would have even accepted a lie about what happened. And while I understand that people order different items and some things take longer than others, none of us ordered complicated menu items and that doesn't excuse having people sit for almost two hours without having their meal served to them.  Finally, as we approached the two hour mark, we all decided we had had enough and told them we wanted to pay the bill and leave. The server did me the favor of "Drinks and Meals are on them."  Really?   WHAT MEALS?   If my meals are on the house then can I please have them?So, we left and sorry Liliana's but you lost our patronage.I'm conflicted. I enjoyed my meal at Liliana's. The rest of my party was a tad less enthusiastic. But this is my review, right? Right. So it gets a three.The atmosphere of the restaurant is fun! It's classy, yet playfully New Orleans-like. There were cool lights representing street lamps of sorts, which lined the walkway/hallway to more seating that I found cool, plus a fountatin that was adjacent to the table we were at. First impressions: great. As far as food goes....three cheers for the complimentary cornbread! I LOVE cornbread and theirs was served nice and toasty warm with a jalapeno butter and it was all glorious. As I hysterically raved about the cornbread, we ordered calamari (of course) as an appetizer and while fried calamari is not my personal favorite, this dish was polished off by everyone else.For entrees, we ordered:*jambalya of blackened shrimp, andouille sausage, taso ham, nueske's bacon, peppers, tomatoes, onions, rice*pasta liliana - shrimp, andouille, chicken, parpadelle pasta, spicy red pepper cream sauce*pork tenderloin special*scottish salmon, red pepper risotto, julienned squash, balsamic reduction, chive oil*caesar saladThe jambalya was tasty though I feel unworthy of bashing/bolstering this dish as jambalya is uncharted territory for me. Truthfully, I'd say this was only my second experience with jambalya. Soooo I'm far from an expert on the dish. But I did enjoy it. I appreciated how the various ingredients/components worked together and complimented one another.The pasta dish got the thumbs up. The pork tenderloin special, on the other hand, was mediocre. The pork was rather tough and overcooked. And the dish as a whole just had too much going on that it wasn't a cohesive entrée. The flavors were all over the place, not in a good way.The salmon that I ordered as my meal was very tasty. The fish and risotto were both cooked just right and seasoned perfectly. Overall, I'm glad I tried Liliana's....and man am I craving that cornbread right about now.Wow. I had heard of this place, and to be honest, felt that it wasn't "really my bag, baby." I couldn't have been more wrong - Liliana's definitely is my bag, baby! Awesome - just awesome.+ Sat at "Charlie's Bar"+ Excellent - nay, superb - bartenders and staff; very helpful and friendly+ Water glasses kept full throughout entire visit; barely ever hit half empty+ Nice tap list; heavy Abita influence, which is cool by me, Daddio+ Happy hour until 6:00pm; $1 off taps and other specials+ Great little jazzy duo playing songs in the far corner of the bar (Wednesday night)+ Perfect volume; not too loud - just an ideal background sound+ Played until at least 8:30pm - were still playing when I left+ Bartender recommended the crab cakes & the grass-fed, Angus fillet+ With the exception of the seafood, all food is locally sourced within a hundred miles or less+ The crab cakes were excellent - Personally would've preferred a bit more "lumpy" crab; was a bit on the smooth side+ The steak was otherworldly - just beautifully done and supremely tasty+ Ordered medium-rare & it arrived a *perfect* medium rare - YAY!+ Prices were super reasonable+ French press coffee - yes, please+ Wine list/options recognized by Wine Spectator (as of 2013)+ David, the owner and executive chef walked-by, introduced himself, and asked how everything was; I got the impression he is genuinely interested and invested in getting feedback about his business.This place will be on my short-list of go-to venues when I'm on the south side of town. I am angry with myself for not checking them out earlier - as mentioned, I wrongly believed the menu would be heavy on jambalaya and gumbo... wrong, wrong, wrong - it's a diverse menu and the food is perfectly executed. Don't be dumb like I was (ahem, am) - go. Go now.Sad face. Very sad face.I *love* Liliana's - or should I say, "loved." Based on my previous visits, I couldn't have recommended this place any more than I did. But this most recent visit, on Monday, June 9, 2014 left a seriously bad taste with me.- Arrived and requested seats at the bar, where the service has typically been outstanding. Was told the bar "is pretty much closed because of some Chef thing we're doing, I guess." (read that in a disinterested hostess voice)+ Was seated outside on the front patio. -When I inquired as to whether or not it was non-smoking, the hostess said, "Um, I don't really know. I don't see anyone smoking right now, so my guess is not?" + She later confirmed that it was indeed, non-smoking+ Server, Jeff, arrived quickly, introduced himself, and asked about drinks. I was just in the process of checking in via the Yelp app; I set it down, inquired about the Abita taps, and ordered a Jockamo IPA. Friend ordered a Liliana's Hurricane.- Jeff disappeared for 15 minutes, only reappearing to refill the waters and to tell us that the drinks "were almost ready." I asked if we could order cheese curds, as it had been 15 minutes since we sat down. He took the order and disappeared. - A few minutes later, he arrived; my beer had obviously been sitting at the bar for quite some time, as had the Hurricane - both were extremely sweaty. The ice in the hurricane was nearly completely melted. I suspect Jeff had forgotten about our drinks...- Jeff reappeared and took our food order; a catfish po boy and a burger. I asked for a side of the "cheddar grits" as they sounded excellent and were included with a few of the entrees. He assured me assured this was not a problem.- Cheese curds arrived and they were a mess of exploded, over-cooked, overly salty shells of vapid batter, sans any hint of cheese. We opened every single curd with a fork and knife and found zero cheese - it had all been cooked-out while in the fryer. The tempura-style batter was no match for spending too much time in the fryer. - We couldn't find Jeff to flag him down to alert him to the problem. When he did reappear, I asked him to swing by and explained to him the problem with the curds. He said he'd get a new order. My beer was empty at this point, as was my water, but he was gone so quickly, I didn't have a chance to order a refill.- I also feared that the new curds would arrive at exactly the same time as the entrees... and, my fear was confirmed. Out came the curds, followed by the entrees. Before Jeff could turn around to bolt away, I asked for another beer, and also asked for the wifi password. This seemed to confuse Jeff; he wasn't sure if they had wifi. When I showed him the "Liliana's Guest" wifi network, he said he'd be back with the password...+ Burger was superb. Perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned, fresh greens, tasty bleu cheese, and a great bun.- The cheddar grits were anything but grits. They came out in a fried and formed cake-like shape, resembling more of a crab cake than creamy cheddary grits. I cut into the grits and found no semblance of anything grit - it was like a cheesy hash brown. I'm fairly certain grits don't contain chunks of onion and potato.+ Catfish Po Boy was excellent - perfectly cooked catfish, nicely seasoned, tasty slaw, and a hearty, yet not-overwhleming bun. The accompanying side of white bean salad consisted primarily of couscous, pesto, and garlic. Only a few white beans were found.- The second attempt of curds were slightly less blown-out, but they were completely devoid of any "cajun" seasoning (they're sold as Cajun Cheese Curds). Instead, they were terribly salty, greasy, and just not good at all. My friend observed that they tasted like "carnival fair batter" - sweet, and overly salty. - Never saw Jeff again. He didn't bring the password, he didn't follow-up on the meal, and he didn't drop off the check. After sitting for 20 minutes or so, staring helplessly at the restaurant, we got up and went to the bar to grab our check. The table next to us did the same thing; they had a similar service nightmare...$60 for a truly unmemorable meal and an even more forgetful experience (literally). The maddening part was that I saw Chef Dave sitting in the bar, at a long table, surrounded by other chef-types. They were talking about the service industry... as I walked out, the hostess didn't bother to lift her head from her phone - she was busy tapping away on the screen.Ugh. What a polarizing experience... Lovely night at a restaurant that I previously enjoyed beyond compare, with subpar food and truly horrid service. Wow.

Had breakfast here. Am I eating at Hometown Buffet? That's the vibe I got.Only buffet I ever ate at in my life where I only went up for food twice. (I'm usually a 4 or 5 round minimum. ask my stomach)Cheap in price, so you get what you pay for.

Met a business associate here for a breakfast meeting the other day.  I rarely come to this Cracked Egg location, but it was convenient at the time.I ordered the Short Stack (2 giant Pankcakes).  They were very good, as usual.  The Cracked Egg rarely disappoints.  This location was very busy when we were here on a Friday morning.  However, the server kept up with the craziness and we were well taken care of.  We also took our time since we were there to discuss business matters....not once were we felt unwelcome because we were taking our time.Overall, great service, great food.Will I return?  You bet.

i reaallly like the decor here. i love the ceilings! the lights! the servers/busboys shirts"TIP WAITERS NOT COWS".."IF U ARE WHAT U EAT IM FRESH, HOT, & EZ"! i love the grill area everything and some!its located in the back of mirage instead of towards the buffet u go the other way towards cpk and pass the deli. then u hit this small margarita bar & bltburger. hannah s & i shared the vegetable salad w grilled chicken (vegetable salad REALLY now isnt that obvious??) it comes with everything possible i mean its lettuce with radish, water chestnut, carrot, cucumber, celery, so much other stuff but my mine just blanked oops. but too bad the grilled chicken was dry as heck...i mean sooo dryyyyy it was like corkboard. also i didnt like that it automatically came with ceasar dressing blah....and they only had 2 other salads which sounded grossdee got a burger which the other girls tried and they said it was sooooooo tender and delish! too bad hannah & i were sick of burgers after serendipity! their fries are a good portion but for $5...no way whatta rip.o the girls also got this fully loaded lookin potato wedges that looked off the hook to bad i didnt get to try any!quick eat in a nicely decorated restaurant!I could give you a rundown of this whole menu item by item and tell you where to get a better version of it somewhere else in Vegas AND at a better price.  LBS at Red Rock blows this place away in every way possible.  $5 for fries??  Give me a break.This place screwed up my order and still gets five stars. We ordered carry out because we wanted to lounge in the room and not have to deal with the crowds.Their burger was incredible! The meat was smoky, the bacon was bomb and it was so juicy and glorious. Now the downfall was we ordered cheddar and got some kind of weird ass cheese on there. It was a strange phenom to be gagging as youre eating such an incredible burger. Hmm...And we also ordered the waffle fries with the bacon and cheese on top. OUT OF THIS WORLD.Relatively cheap at $5 for about 5 big yummy fries and I nearly wanted a second order they were so awesome.Huge crispy waffle fries covered in loads of cheese, bacon bits, green onion and jalapeno with sour cream to dip them in...if there was better than Fat Girl heaven, this would certainly be it.I didnt think it was that expensive compared to many other places so I definitely, definitely eat there again.after a strenuous day trying to turn nickels into millions at my favorite monopoly slot machines and playing all the hard ways, we ended up at BLT burger at the Mirage where we were staying awhile back.their signature blt burger was pretty good. a gf and i shared the salmon burger and some salad. i guess i was trying to be "healthier" but unfortunately also it didn't hit the spot. actually the cobb salad was decent. but the salmon burger was dry. nothings worse than a dry fish patty. luckily the bf was kind enough to give me some of his burger to wash down the salmon. fries were pretty good. but commenting on food in a casino can be tricky, cuz usually you're either drunk, your tastebuds are killed from all the smoke inhaling oryour brain is half zapped from getting zero sleep!but it all made the stop at Studio B Buffet on the way home all the much better!!!My boyfriend and I came here super late night for grub after a ton of drinking and gambling....only to discover that they had PITCHERS OF STONE IPA. We had been on the hunt at the Mirage for good beer and didn't find any  until the end of the night. We were seated immediately and ordered a pitcher and food. My boyfriend and I decided to take a vacation from being Pescatarians this Thanksgiving so we splurged and shared the Cowboy burger, fried pickles, and some chili cheese fries. The burger was perfect. The beef patty was moist and juicy...just the way I imagined it would be after not having a real burger in YEARS. It was also really neat to eat. The burger held together really well and wasn't falling apart. The chili cheese fries were off the menu and they were wicked good. Don't even get me started on the frickles.Thanking BLT Burger for hitting the spot. We struck GOLD when we found good beer here!!Came here with my grandmother for a late night snack. We ordered the spinach dip which came to us in a hot little bowl but realized the dip was COLD. The waitress was kind enough to send it back to heat up. What we got back, I assume, was our same dip put into a different bowl since it was a smaller amount.I took a bite and it tasted bitter and barely warm. In all honesty the dip was terrible. It tasted like horseradish was put into it and mixed around. I stopped eating but my grandmother ate more.We finished and paid and went up to our room. In the elevator my grandmother said her stomach didn't feel well. Once we got into our room, she ended up vomiting for several munutes!! My stomach felt weird as well but I have a strong stomach. Whatever you do, do NOT order the spinach dip!

With the proliferation of chic burger joints in the city, I was very happy to discover this unpretentious little gem of a restaurant in a secluded corner of the Plateau. All I needed that cold Saturday evening was a burger and a poutine, and I must say they filled my cravings with flying colours. My burger was well put together, held its shape even towards the end, when usually burgers start to fall apart, and it was daaaahlicious. I can't remember the name of the burger, but it was the one with a strip of bacon in it. The poutine also made my heart sing, for they were crispy in all the right places, sweet in the right degrees and covered in just the right amount of gravy. As for my husband's order, he had a plate of boulettes d'agneau topped with feta and emmenthal cheese. and he loved it. The restaurant atmosphere was also cosy and being away from the hustle and bustle of Mont-Royal Avenue, I felt a bit like in a small town's greasy spoon, which was a sweet feeling. At the end of the meal I said to myself, why haven't I been here earlier?

Review Text :
Alright I never thought of reviewing the IKEA cafeteria before.  But my husband and I ran into Audrey W and HER plus one (yes, kind of pathetic we were both at IKEA on a holiday weekend), and she mentioned the cafeteria has not only been reviewed but gets glowing ratings.  You gotta be kidding me.  Yes, the food isn't bad and some of it is actually pretty good.  But usually if you're eating there, you're fed up and in dire need of being fed, which could taint your perspective just a bit.  But the rest of the experience is tolerable at best, nauseating at its worst.Today was a typical experience.  Most of the trays were wet or dirty or both.  I had to go through several glasses to find acceptably clean ones...acceptably clean, not necessarily clean.  The line was backed up so we thought paying cash would be good.  Too bad the guy working did not have change to break a $20 when our bill was $18.30.  Most every table was dirty.  There was no ligonberry drink (the one highlight of this experience in general) to be found.  A small child was spotted running around like a lunatic, only stopping long enough to eat food off of a dirty plate she found in the clean up pile.  Parents?  Anywhere?  Hello?  Unfortunately, I was not in the men's room to witness the horror of a man chasing a naked child through the restroom...naked as in completely naked.  Luckily it was the child and not the man.  And luckily it was not my husband doing the chasing.  At least I don't think it was.So if this is everyone's idea of a 5-star experience, I'm sorry for you or maybe for me for not seeing what everyone else does.  In any case, I've had better, but I'm sure I will be back.

Review Text :
I went to Il Posto last night because I wanted to eat there one more time before I wrote my review. I go there for lunch with the work bunch on occasion. They have a popular lunch special with pizza and salad ($7), but I especially like the goat cheese sandwich. It's a flavored pita folded over marinated veggies and loads (I mean LOADS) of goat cheese! It's called a panini, I think, which threw me the first time because a hot pressed sandwich comes to mind when I hear the word but this one is not hot. Let me tell you: that is NO REASON to skip the burst of flavors this provides!A few weeks ago, I was there to grab a quick drink with a friend. We sat out on the cute patio that is set up to look like a street in Little Italy, U.S.A. These people can pour a drink! I already had a dinner commitment, so I just noshed on the bread and pesto that was provided. The pesto was loaded with parmesan... soo delish! And, the warm bread was better than any I've found in Arizona so far!Last night, I had a crab cake appetizer as my entrée. I got three for $11. Not much filler, but lots of diced veggies like onion, peppers mixed with the crab. I was full by the time I finished and could not have taken another bite! All together, I had two (generous) vodka sodas and the crab cakes (plus more bread and pesto, of course!) for just under $30.I hear from a lot of people in the neighborhood how they miss Our Gang (what this place used to be called) and they lament the old meat sauce or some other menu item that got dropped when they changed the name. Last night, I found out the meat sauce is back! And, Matt, the manager has been very accommodating and open to suggestions every time I've had a minute to pester him about what's going on with the Lounge (the '60 era-Sinatra style venue they plan to open next door).So, now I have my eye on the white pizza and can't wait to go back!I was really impressed with Il Posto, especially after all of the mediocre reviews. My favorite Yelper, Christina P, put together a UYE here last night, and the event could not have been more perfect.The bartender and staff were really friendly and made us feel very welcome. They have a fantastic patio with a fire pit in the middle which made for a perfect happy hour setting.We happened to be there on the night they unveiled their specialty pizza line. I had the pleasure of trying both the margharita and the goat cheese & onion, both of which I thought were fantastic. They also serve bread with a cheesy pesto dipping sauce that was to die for.Our group ending up trying a lot of different pizza's and everyone seemed to really enjoy.I was pleased with their happy hour specials ($2 off specialty pizzas; $1 off appetizers, well drinks, house wines and draft beers) and especially pleased that they extended those specials for our group for the entire time we were there.This is another time I wish we could give 1/2 stars because I would give Il Posto a 4.5... and I will definitely be back to grab another glass of the Chateau Ste. Michelle Riesling and snack on one of those delish speciality pizza's on the patio!I woke up this morning with Il Posto on my mind and garlic on my breath. We've driven past Il Posto many times en route to visiting a friend who lives in the area, but hadn't taken the opportunity to stop in. Last night, that changed. As part of a large group of about 20, I was concerned there would be too much confusion over drinks and food orders. Such was not the case. Our servers were prompt and attentive and were able to remember our names. Amazing! The bread and pesto they start you with is great. Even better was the insane amount of garlic they use. The bruscetta was wonderful. The NY Spinach White Pizza was out of this world!! Our one friend is moving out of this area of town, but we'll be back for Il Posto.I can now say I've been to Il Posto for lunch, dinner, and happy hour.  I love their patio so much that I wouldn't even consider eating inside, even if it was 100 degrees outside.  I'm surprised more hasn't been mentioned about their delish homemade potato chips.  I've been known to skip the salad so that I could fill up on more chips.I'm usually like meat, but went with the margherita pizza last night and I can say I'm impressed.  The bread and pesto sauce were also excellent.With great atmosphere and good food, I'll definitely go back.3 1/2 StarsAlright, I'll try and make this one short and sweet and follow the old expression "If you don't have anything nice to say..." because I really did like parts of Il Posto...Let me start by saying that the staff was incredible!  About 20 or so of us Yelpers gathered yesterday for a Happy Hour organized by the fantastic Christina P and the staffers were very pleased to oblige.Like Bacon B said before me, I'm always nervous about being a part of a large party because it is practically inevitable that they are going to screw up at least some of our orders, and it is guaranteed that mine will always be one of them.  That said this was sooo not the case here.  I was shocked!  We sat outside and were all served at our leisure by 1 bartender who I from here on out will refer to as Superman, because he obviously had some sort of magical powers to serve all 20 of us individually, simultaneously, and screwed up no one's orders mind you...I'll continue to touch on the good.  The patio was great.  Very spacious area with a fire pit in the middle which added some lovely ambiance to the evening, and hey, who doesn't look better by firelight?? Now on to the less than good...The Happy Hour specials were okay, to be honest I'm not thrilled by $1 off of things, I think it's kind of weak.  However, many of Il Posto's drink prices were already fairly low, so the $1 off could sway some.First of all, I will say that their fresh bread and pesto dip which was free mind you was delicious.  The pizza though, not so much...Let me preface this by saying that I am from NYC and I take my pizza very seriously...it is a bit of an art for meI don't want to say too much because I do want to go back and try some different things because the rest of the experience was lovely, but no, unfortunately, I did not enjoy my pizza.  It was undercooked, the dough was unimpressive, and I had to use a knife and fork because it was so soggy.All in all I had a nice time at Il Posto, mainly because of the company, but I would be willing to go back and give it another shot.I joined the crew last night for the HH organized by the fabulous Christina P. Although it was my first visit and I generally like to sample a place a few times before reviewing, there were so many of us there that I felt that I had gotten a pretty well-rounded experience and had enough information to provide input. Phoenix is known for its host of strip mall restaurants, but few can actually transport you to another place. The restaurant interior is a mix of kitschy Italian and moderately nice mainstream. The main patio is actually about the same size as the restaurant interior and is flanked by two cute NYC street scenes (think universal studios city scene) with each window telling a different story and the Statue of Liberty holding court. Very quaint! The back of the patio is taken up by a complete bar. The fire pit that others have mentioned is situated in the middle. The patio is clearly the place to be at this venue!Service was spot on, which was unexpected for such a large group. I have to echo Georgie S., the bartender seemed to single handedly (with the exception of bussing support) kept our brood quenched and fed with no errors. He asked each guests name upon their initial order and remembered them throughout the remainder of the evening. No simple feet, if you consider that we had at least 20 people in our party and he was also serving the numerous other guests that shared our al fresco setting.The manager Matt, came out to thank us for coming by and informed us that there is a separate patio in the back to accommodate private parties/functions. What a divine setting for almost any family or business gathering!In addition to the ambience and service, there is the food... Oddly one of the best things of the evening was the free appetizer provided to each table, which consists of bread and a parmesan/pesto dipping sauce that is so infused with garlic that its sweet fragrance swirls in the air. Now as Bacon B. points out, this will stay with you (i.e.: if you are on a date, you should both eat some) but it is seriously out of this world! I also really enjoyed the bruschetta, which is a classic take on the dish in every aspect except size. More often than not you will receive four or six small slices of toast with some tomatoes and basil carefully assembled on top, but not here... instead you will be served a small flatbread mounded with fresh hand cut tomatoes, chiffonades of basil and more of that dreamy garlic.I was also able to sample two of the new pizza offerings. The Roberto's (ironically offered up by the fabulous Robert M.), which was set off by a sprinkling of pepperocinis offering just a little kick, and the White pizza which had more of those rich garlic undertones. Although I enjoyed the toppings on each of the pizzas, I was left wanting more from the crust. Both were uniform in size and shape and a little on the tough / dense side, which made me wonder if they were not made in house. That said, it was not enough to detract from the overall experience and I will definitely be back in the near future.Il Posto has some really good aspects and it has some so-so aspects.The outside patio area is completely awesome. It's like you're sitting in a little Italian cafe, with one of the walls mocked up to look like the side of an old style European building. There are Christmas lights strung about in different locations, a small bar area, a lil fountain and some other cool decorations. It's worth a trip just to hang out in their decked out patio area, if only to have some drinks.The service was awesome. Our waiter was totally cool, friendly and accommodating. The fresh baked bread and oil with cheese dipping sauce was fantastic. Loved it.They had local beer (Kiltlifter) on tap for only $3 a pint. awesome.The salads and pasta entrees were just ok, which is the reason behind my 3 star rating. I just wasn't wowed by the main course. We'll definitely be back to try them again though, perhaps to sample their highly rated pizzas. I predict a review sequel in my future.For those wondering, the restaurant.com coupons work fine, however the incompetent staff at Il Posto couldn't and/or wouldn't figure out 18% for the included gratuity.The coupon clearly states that it would be included, so no surprise there........but a big WTF when I realized looking at the receipt that they had either purposefully or accidentally calculated exactly 20% as the autogratuity.Now by saying it may have been an accident, I'm really pushing things and trying to be nice because I overall liked the place.I cannot honestly come up with an explanation as to how a person who'd graduated 4th grade math could read a peice of paper saying 18% and then calculate 20%, unless is was blatantly done on purpose with the idea that the customer wasn't going to figure it out.SHAME SHAME SHAMEThe decor here is a mish-mash of old and new, good and bad, nice and ugly.  They've recently done (some) remodeling, since I saw a huge dumpster in the parking lot, but they aren't finished inside.  There are huge areas where exposed surfaces are in need of paint or drywall, and a huge sheet of plastic hung in a doorway behind us, swooshing with every breeze of a server walking by.The outside patio area did indeed look very neato, like a street in italy or new york.  Inside, they have a dining area with warm wood accents, a lit-up fountain, and dim lighting (which i liked, but the mrs said was making her feel woozy) right next to the kitchen area's flourescent light fixtures and flourescent lime green paint.  What classiness the first area had was lost with barely a shift of your glance, since there's no wall or anything separating the two areas.The very uncomfortable booths have hard wood back and a butt cushion that's token at best, with the bottom of the seat being way too long, so your back can't reach the seatback so you are forced to chose between sitting upright with no backrest at all, or slouching so badly that a painful arch is in your middle back.The food had good and bad, as well.  The bread basket with pesto dip was superb, and like many others have said, we should've simply eaten that until full and then left.  The lady's ceviche was a huge portion, and said to be very good (didn't eat it), but the tortillas I did sample were overcooked, looking only slightly dark but tasting burnt.My NY strip pizziaola - after being ordered as "tell the chef to aim for between Medium and Medium Rare" - arrived at barely even MR, but was tasty enough with all that garlicy marinara (*SLICES* of shaved garlic, like in Goodfellas!) that the extra juiciness was okay with me.  I used more of the appetizer bread to soak up the bloodiness.  Mmmmm aus juisThe other had a penne dish with chicken and mushrooms in a brown sauce.  This was said to be all just fine, but my keen eye saw the chicken going untouched and a few peices of penne being pushed around.  Probing proved that all was not just fine, since the chicken was quite dry, and the penne was so barely grasping to reach al dente doneness that she thought at first it might be whole wheat pasta (the dim lighting may have contributed also).Service was 'eh'.  Yes, that's right.  It was so generic, by-the-book, make sure we cover all the requisite phrases and checking in moments -- but nothing more than that -- that I cannot even warrant the "M" to give them the entire 'meh'.  When inquiring if we'd like wine, and asked for Spumante, the server replied, "you mean Spumoni?!? We don't have that."We looked at each other.....I so badly wanted to ask "so, you don't have the wine, or you don't have the ice cream?"....but we both just gave a tentative "okaaaaaaay..."    Chose not to try getting any wine.   8^ |There was nothing too horrible about the service, but nothing great either......EXCEPT of course there was the fact that someone involved in making up the bill decided to _*help themselves*_ to a 20% gratuity when the coupon states that an 18% gratuity is included.Even with the mediocre service, I would have added a personal table tip to the auto-gratuity, but I certainly did not do that once I saw the 20% on the bill.I also chose not to bring it up with the server, because it was obvious that they already knew that it was calculated at 20%, and I wasn't about to play the whole Pretend It Was An Error game.There was no mis-reading the coupon.There was no mistake in the math.It was *calculated* at exactly 20% with intention.So that's what they got from me.  Nothing else....except this review.When we arrived we were told there was a 45 minute wait. I looked around at all the empty tables... Hmm.. So where are all these people and where are they waiting?She points me next door to a really cool and swanky lounge. I couldn't tell if this was an extension of the restaurant or  a separate entity. Either way it was pretty cool. We sat down and ordered a drink, then not 5 minutes later the hostess came in and told us table was ready. Now I can't really complain that our 45 minute wait turned in to a 5 minute wait, but honestly with all the empty tables in the place it felt as if they were trying to turn people away. The starter bread was fresh and the pesto was divine. We ordered the eggplant rollatini to start and were sorely disappointed at the mushy mess placed in front of us. It had the consistency of soggy enchiladas and try as I might I could not find eggplant through all the cheese. I ordered a salad and it was forgotten, I asked for it again after we got our main and it was forgotten. The main was a cavatelli something: Pasta, tomatoes, bell pepper, onion and sausage. It was decent, but I could have made it better myself at home. We also ordered a $32 bottle of Pinot Noir. Now I know that there is a huge mark up on bottles of wine, but please take the AJ's $7.99 price tag off before putting it down in front of me.3 stars for venue alone. The patio absolutely rocks and the new lounge next door is great for after dinner cocktails. The food and service need a little work, but I'll probably come back and try the pizza.Quite possibly the worst steak I have ever been served. I ordered it medium, it came out bloody and I sent it back. After 20 minutes they brought it back and it was charred. It was so chewy and tough I couldn't finish two bites. Horrible. The server was incredibly slow and inattentive. I may have a drink on the patio some day, but I will not eat at this place again.

My girlfriend dragged me here because she wanted to have some all-you-can-eat crab legs.At 7pm the place was packed but we were seated quickly. You do not pay 1st here. Drinks are extra.Well the buffet is really small and all bad asian food. lots of shrimp and fish and some crab legs, a few plates of sushi on plates covered in saran wrap.The dessert bar was a joke-generic cookies and stale bad cake. Fruit and pudding with soft serve ice cream.We were there for an hour-I made 5 trips & not once did they change out any food. The spare ribs looked terrible and everyone noticed because it was busy & nobody ate any. The crab was the winner.Everyone was loading up plates of crab. Myself I'm not into seafood.I see others have given this a positive review because its cheap but thats they only positive thing here. The food is not real impressive but there is all you can eat ice creamcheck here for pics @ http://www.usmenuguide.com/krazybuffetmenupics.htmlDefinitely better than Buffet Asia.  This might be Chinese food heaven for someone that lives in the boonies but it was just alright for me.  They definitely offer a lot for the price and I happily stuffed myself with as many green veggies/meat combos as possible.  All the servers were really friendly and were prompt to refill beverages and take away plates.  3.3389821 stars!!My fella is an Asian buffet food fiend and I try to indulge him from time to time by enduring a meal at Buffet of Asia because I'm a good girlfriend! This morning I decided to indulge him as well as my Yelpyness by trying a new place where he could eat Asian food til her bursts and I'd have the opportunity to check off a bookmark from my list. Win win. We arrived around 11 and the place wasn't too busy. The place is pretty clean and service was really attentive. Refills were quick and plates were cleared away quickly as well. On to the food. The line was kept clean and the food options were plentiful. I was impressed by the amount of veggie options that they had. That is often lacking in buffets. I will probably never be a big fan of buffets, but this is one of the better options in town.This was our first visit and it is about time as my curiosity for the last few years has been going wild every time we pass by and see a packed lot.I used to live just a block from here approximately four years ago when they were building Krazy Buffet. I had moved just prior to their opening and wondered what affect it would have on one of my favorite Chinese restaurants just down the street (Bobo China). I was in the mood for Chinese and we were very hungry, wanting to resolve our lunch and dinner all in one shot.The place is clean, has comfy cushy booths, lots of variety of food to select from and great staff clearing tables and bringing drink refills.The food was good, not bad and not great. The sushi was better than usual buffet sushi which is usually horrid. I enjoyed the stuffed mussels, orange chicken, fried rice, fried shrimp, coconut shrimp, sushi, meatball skewers, pot stickers, cherry bananas and coconut macaroons for dessert.Mmmmm those pork meatball skewers were packed full of flavor with a drizzle of BBQ sauce on them. Yummy. I could sit and just eat a plate of those balls and be satisfied. They have a great salad bar as well which was super fresh and had all of the toppings and dressing you could want.My hubby really enjoyed the super big juicy chicken wings fried to perfection in a delicious light batter.This visit did the trick, we came we ate and we conquered.Their building was built new and looks nice on the outside however the inside of the restaurant was dumpy looking with old booths.

After filling our tummies with HH food specials from Brio, Tommy Bahama's Tropical Cafe was next on our happy hour tour along Town Square.They offer happy hour daily from 4 pm to 7 pm.They do offer quite a few drinks and food items such as small plate appetizers for $5 and drinks ranging from $3-$7.  (Beer $3, Martinis $7)  We only stuck to the drink menu this time around.I started off with: * Coconut Cloud Martini "Tommy Bahama White Sand Rum, Stoli Vanil vodka, Cruzan Coconut rum, cream of coconut, shaken, strained and sprinkled with toasted coconut." - A smooth drink of coconut goodness that has you transporting to the islands soon!  Their touch of toasted coconut on top really brings the drink together and gives it a nice crunch and aftertaste.  Next up: * Kohala Coladas "Bacardi Superior rum and cream of coconut added to your favorite flavor - Mango, Key Lime and Pina Colada - blended with ice and topped with a dark rum float."  I went with mango for mine and you really can't go wrong with a colada here.  A piece of pineapple and an umbrella tops it off.The Husband isn't usually one for 'fruity' drinks, but the lure of banana and coconut had him downing a few of these babies:* The BBC "Bailey's and Emmet's Irish Cremes, fresh banana and cream of coconut, blended with ice." - What can I say but damn, this is good. It tastes like a coconut and banana smoothie.  At first you can't even taste the alcohol, which of course has you wondering if there's really any in it.  But once you get up, you'll feel it.  There's good stuff in there!It wasn't too busy on a Friday afternoon, compared to the other neighboring restaurants running happy hour.  I think it's because their bar is all inside and you do have a "Tommy Bahama" type crowd if that makes any sense.  Our bartenders were pleasant and drinks arrived quickly, so we had no problems with service here at all.  And there's live music too - someone playing a few cover songs is an added bonus.Overall, Tommy Bahama's is a more laid back place to be when you want to sip some umbrella drinks, feel like you're on vacation, and not get mixed up in the dress to impress crowd.  And plus, their drinks are yummy good and the alcohol definitely sneaks up on you.Where do I start?  There were so many good things about this Tommy Bahama experience that I think I could live there.  They'd probably mind that though, huh?My sis & I shopped at the cute Tommy Bahama store attached to the restaurant and bar before we decided it would be the perfect place for happy hour!  They had a lot of delicious looking specialty drinks but we narrowed our choice to the Blueberry Basil Smash.  And even though it was $12 a drink and we were expecting martini glass cocktails, we were happily surprised when the drinks arrived in pint glasses looking like blueberry mojitos.  :)  We definitely got our moneys worth!  These drinks are the bomb!!!  My sis found the recipe online (http://www.tommybahama.com/TBG/Stores_Restaurants/Drink_of_the_Month.jsp) and then ordered us both mojito muddlers too!  It won't be the same sipping this cocktail without her, but I'll cheers her every time I make it!The menu was filled with yummy food too.  We ordered the Coconut Shrimp and then changed our minds and got the Scallop Sliders.  These had fresh basil and cilantro on them and they were so fresh and flavorful!  I love sliders and they're always made with meat so I don't get to enjoy them.  It was kind of a fantasy to find seafood sliders.  :)The vibe was Carribean and we felt like we were on a tropical vacation with the steel drum and reggae music.  I wish Tommy Bahama had a hotel so I could stay longer.  Definitely worth the trip!The original plan was to do Brio's happy hour but they only had food specials and no discounts on drinks that day.  Might as well just call it apathy hour.  We had never been here so thought we'd finally give it a shot.  Fish tacos were the big standout of the happy hour menu.  These are the kind of tacos you imagine eating while vacationing at a beach resort.  I could've eaten 6 of them.  Ahi tuna was also good.  Judging by other patrons around us, the sliders were the most popular so we'll try that on a future visit.  Drinks were fruity and strong although none were too memorable (cause and effect?).  They also had a guy doing acoustic guitar renditions of songs by the likes of Van Morrison, Coldplay and the Chili Peppers.  I would've requested Stephen Bishop if we had stayed longer.OUTSTANDING VEGGIE BURGER. They make them fresh daily. Packed with beans, rice, corn and spices. It was so delicious I had to write a review ASAP. I think it was $12.99 and included a side of fruit and either a simple salad or cup of soup. Not cheap, but worth every dollar. Everyone knows how hard it is to find a decent veggie burger that's not just a frozen patty.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA#8M4591pmudsTKD6IhLwd-AThe service was meh. He redeemed himself towards the end, but gosh it was awkward when our server took our food orders and then messed up the drinks. Maybe he had a hangover or a hemorrhoid flare-up. Got me. FYI- If you carry a purse bring a purse hook. The chairs are rounded at the top so you cannot hang your purse. Regretfully I had to put my nice purse on the ground because I didn't want to eat with it on my lap. This was annoying. FYI Take Two- Be careful of the palm tree outside the door. I swear it jumped out and stabbed my boob when no one was looking. Glad it wasn't my eye, but still not the kind of physical relationship I want to have with a palm tree. Like ever.Solid 4 Stars, easy.I have been here a few times for their happy hour in their charming patios by the beautiful central park with a view of the gorgeous fountain pond, and really enjoyed it. This mid-Dec evening, our party of three came for both happy hour AND dinner, and had a wonderful experience! We'll be back!YELPY DETAILS you could SkipOn this cool, mid-Dec evening, our party of 3 came for the happy hour first in its spacious, stylish lounge with a classy bar. Although the bar counter was large, it was more than half full around 5. Our nice hostess placed us at a comfy corner table. We ordered our rounds of red wine (Penfolds Rawson's Retreat Cabernet, $5; BR Cohn Retreat Cab Sauvingnon, $7). Both wines were smooth and tasty. For munchies, we shared several small plates (pull pork quesadilla, 3 per order;  $5; Angus sliders, 2 per order $6; Jerk Chicken Lollipops, $5). All of them were quite flavorful.This evening, they also had a young man (Joe) with a pleasant, mellow voice singing and playing his guiter! We all warmed up to him quickly by his nice performance! - He even took requests from audience, and did an excellent rendition of "On the Road Again"! At dinner time, the hostess led us to our table by the window facing the beautiful park with a gorgeous, gigantic Christmas Tree! Our sweet waitress, Joni, helped us select our entrée: 2 Ribeye with a side of potatoes ($39@), and Crabmeat stuffed shrimps with a side of spinach, $30. The shrimps were crunch, fresh and delicious. The ribeye steak, medium rare was juicy, tender and full of flavor. My ribeye order, cooked to MEDIUM, was a bit too dry, though still tasty - my own mistake for ordering it MEDIUM! The potatoes and spinach were excellent. Over dinner, we were entertained by the view of the beautiful Christmas Tree in the park with its lights changing colors over music, and occasionally peppered by falling (faux) snow flakes! What a wonderful holiday treat it was!We were too stuffed to try their tempting deserts, but did enjoy a hot cup of coffee for good measure. The attentive service of Joni and her wait crew, and the tasty dishes...made our dinner another memorable experience! We'll be back for more, perhaps, even sample their deserts! Dec 2013

I came here for lunch with a colleague on Friday and I wasn't super impressed but if you're hungry, it will get the job done!  You can tell that it is a locally owned, family run business and the staff was extremely personable. They get 5 stars!  I got the parmesan chicken salad sandwich and it was good, not great. It was served warm with chicken salad and cheese only. It was very basic. The salad was also super basic and the Italian dressing tasted like Wish-Bone from the grocery store. My colleague got the turkey club and it looked good! I wished that I ordered it when the food came. His looked much better than mine! There aren't many restaurants near them so i'm sure they get business from the nearby corporations!

Cold, wet and exhausted Krista M and I realized we were in front of this St Cat's St Hubert. This is like a classy St Hubert with a hostess and nice big windows, but really you're getting what you always get. Medium caliber rotisserie chicken, ribs, deep fried cheese bites and things like that. But the truth is, a pitcher of beer and some roasty and greasy things are sometimes exactly what you need and this joint on this particular night definitely did not disappoint.

Hurray for a little piece of paradise... thanks  to Paradise for honoring my 3 year old free sandwich coupon  and giving me my scrambled egg breakfast for free. You get mucho points for class in my book! Glad your in Norterra , you are an oasis !I assume all of the PB&C all mostly the same but the few times I have been here it has always been nice. The staff is friendly and helpful, the store is clean. I had an Asaigo bagel with egg and bacon. Apple wood smoked bacon as they tout. The bagel was kick ass, smushed with a panni grill. The egg and cheese were good. The bacon was small rubber strips of ?bacon?...The prices are a little high but this is supposed to be more high end then Mcdonalds right?

I placed an online order on 1-22-11 at approximately 8:45PM and was assigned a pick up time of 9:16PM. I arrived at the location and was told that my order had not been started because the employees forgot to check the fax for an online order. There was another customer there who called in her order, arrived 30 minutes after the call and they still had not started preparing her food and she was being ignored as well. It was not busy, when I arrived, the manager was leaning against a broom talking on her cell phone. The employees were just milling around and no food was being prepared. Additionally there were only 3 tables of customers who were all eating, thus no reason why food should be delayed.  Once I realized it would be another 30 minutes before they could even get to my order I asked for a refund and was refused. I asked 2 additional times for a refund and was refused again by the manager (who is the owner's wife). She did not speak English (per her employees) and because I am African American assumed that I didn't speak Spanish. She proceeded to use racist and derogatory language regarding me and my request to her employees and in ear shot of the restaurant patrons. She referred to me using the slang for whore, fat pig, and the Spanish slang for the N----- word. I continued to request a refund at which time she called the owner Jose Arriola who informed me that I was not getting a refund nor was I getting my food order and even if I called GOD it wouldn't help the situation.I repeated my request for a refund while repeating back his statements for clarification. While I was speaking Jose ended the call by hanging up in my face. Once he ended the call, I asked the female manager? again for a refund. By this time I have been in the restaurant for over 40 minutes. I was told by an employee that Jose was on his way to speak to me in person and to resolve the matter. Within 5 minutes Jose arrived and started a conversation with a friend of his for an additional 30 minutes. I was told in confidence by one of the employees that he was stalling on purpose in hopes that I would either leave without my money or food, or I would cause a scene which would give him reason to call the police.I remained calm and continued to ask at 2 minute intervals for a refund. Finally Jose came to the counter and stated that I would get a refund via online and that he cannot and will not issue a refund in person. I requested something in writing that he agrees to process a refund and that the refund would be placed on my credit card by Monday. He provided me with an incomplete sentence on my receipt stating "Refund order because of ASAP" with his signature. My fear is that he is in fact not going to refund my money and will claim that I received my order. At this point I have filed a complaint with the Arizona AG's office and I am contacting my bank tomorrow (thankfully they are open on Sundays) to begin fraud proceedings. Needless to say I am NEVER eating at another Wingstop anywhere in the world and will encourage others to never eat there again. Beware if you go to the Wingstop on Dobson in Mesa, you may not get your food and you DEFINITELY will not get a refund.Typically, I try to avoid wings these days. I'm older, and my body just doesn't react the same as it used to when I was younger.But, tonight was special. It was my dinner break, and they were the closest and most cost effective place to catch the NFL season opener!I walked in, and there was NOBODY there outside of the employees. Being my first time in a Wingstop, I know I had that "deer in the headlights" look on my face. Unfortunately, the young lady working the counter didn't notice that I might need some help, because she was counting down her cash register so she could go home.Now, I'm relatively bright, and I'm extremely literate, so I figured out what I wanted after a little searching...though, I would have been open to suggestions instead of standing there for five minutes trying to decide what sounded the most palatable.I ended up getting the 10 wing bone-in meal with fries and a drink for about $11. I opted for the regular "Hot" flavored wings, though they did have a decent variety from which to choose if you think you have the gastrointestinal fortitude to palate them. Speaking from former decisions with crazily spiced wings, I do NOT recommend anything rated higher than good 'ol "hot".The wings and fries came out as quickly as could be expected. The wings themselves weren't bad. The "hot"was an excellent choice. Not too spicy, not too bland...just right for my liking. The fries, though...they were a different story. There were three different levels of french fries in my basket:1) Just Right2) Uncooked3) Burnt to a CrispOn top of the inconsistency with the fries, they were WAY over salted...almost to the point of not being edible.The only saving grace for this place was the fact that they were airing the inaugural game of the 2012 NFL season. The service was meh, the food was meh, but the circumstances were fantastic. Somehow, that weird gastric/emotional math equals 3 stars.

Who would have known this place has happy hour sushi if it weren't for Yelp? I wouldn't have!It wasn't quite half off, but a good selection of their rolls and nigiri pieces are $1 off at happy hour. I went on a Wednesday at 6 PM and business was doing well. All the tables were full and people around the bar. The prices are reasonable to begin with, most of the basic rolls are about $3.50-$4.50 so $1 off I think is a great deal. The nigiri is obviously cheaper. Great quality too and extremely friendly service. Can't wait to go back.

Crazy Pita is a delightful little restaurant in The District, that serves flavorful Mediterranean food.My bf and I have been there twice now, and I am pleased to say that their food is consistently good.I LOVE Mediterranean cuisine.   Falafel, hummus, lamb...I love it all, but its sometimes hard to find good quality.Friday evening, having a little time to kill, but not enough time to wait at other places, we decided to hit Crazy Pita.I ordered the kefte platter, which is seasoned ground beef deliciousness.  Its served on a bed of veggie couscous, with hummus, and a cucumber and feta salad. Everything was wonderful.My fella ordered the combination platter, and selected the shrimp and lamb skewers.  YUM.  Shrimp was great, and the lamb was SO tender.  Reasonable prices, clean location, and very friendly staff all add to The Crazy Pita's appeal.  Whenever I find myself on this side of town, I would be glad to come back again.I was meeting a friend for lunch in the District.  I've passed this place many times and it was finally time to try it.  Service here was good.  They were very friendly and accommodating.  Orders were taken quickly and food was prepared efficiently.  The dining area is clean and open.  I ordered the lamb pita with fries.  The pita is topped with tomato, cucumber and romaine.  If you want tzatziki for the pita they will put it on the side.  In my mind I was expecting the lamb to be shaved and not chunks.  The lamb was good but the chunks were a little too big.  I'm also not a huge cucumber fan and there was too much of that inside.  The fries were just ok but nothing special.  My friends skewer plate looked amazing and he definitely liked it.  I would return to try that out.

So apparently if you're reincarnated as a cow you want to be one of the Kobe sort, which is a special breed of Japanese cattle that is given beer daily and a massage so the meat is more tender (thanks Wikipedia!).  All of Burger Stop's meat is Kobe - nice. After reading Joseph A's review of this place my red meat alarm went off and I decided to check it out for myself, and they do a fantastic burger.  Everything is made fresh daily.  So for $12 I got a double patty, fresh cut thin fries, and a soda.  The bun was toasted and slightly crunchy.  Perky avocado and onions.  It was lovely.  I forgot my camera but I'll post a pic next time.  And yeah, the owner/cook does look like George Carlin and although I did not overhear him say any of the 7 words you can't say on television, he'd probably make a good Vegas impersonator.  The one complaint is it takes a little longer than say Fatburger to get your order, a good 15 to 20 mins, but there were a couple of orders in ahead of mine.  And it's worth it when you know its gonna be good.Just a simple easy place to get a nice solid piece of red meat.  Corner of Trop and Eastern.

Review Text :
Wow.  I'm surprised by the eager 4 and 5 star reviews of this place.  Flat out, this place scares and horrifies me.  For many reasons.  Mostly because when any number of my in-laws pick a place to go, it's either this place or Serranos (see my other review)... friendly game of Russian Roulette, anyone?The other main reason I hate this place is the fact that I have to shower when I get home.  The whole family congregates in the laundry room and we all strip.  We leave everything piled in the stench of burnt food and smoking wood and we take showers to get rid of it.  There is nothing worse than your pillow the morning after San Tan Flat if you failed to take a shower when you got home.I don't understand the whole stand in line to order thing.  Is it a sit-down restaurant?  Yes.  If you eat inside and can actually get a table.  Is it a "fast-casual" like Pei Wei?  Kinda.  You stand in line, but no one brings you your food.  So really it's fast food?  You place your order and go get it when your number is called?  Yeah.  But it's a steak and it is ANYTHING but fast.  Speed alone (or lack thereof) is reason enough to stay away.  I don't wait for food.  I don't care how good it is, a wait this long is unacceptable.  Oh, but it's not even good, I forgot to mention.  Actually, my husband and my food came out quickly (20 minutes - and we ordered steaks) - everyone else in the extended family ordered burgers - OVER AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTE WAIT -- FOR A BURGER!!!  Did I mention the food's not that good?  And half the menu is very over-priced.  They should stick to the cheap stuff: it is all anyone orders anyway as evidenced by the run on burgers that caused oppressive delays.Then there is the salad bar -  I'm surprised it passes health code.  See those tongs that are laying ON TOP of the lettuce?  You do realize that everyone else in the place has had their greasy little paws on that handle that is in direct contact with the pile of lettuce?  icky poo.And then there are the fire pits.  Has OSHA been here?  Good God, this is such an accident waiting to happen.  It is SO friggin' dark out there, there are all these raging fire pits, kids running everywhere, all these odd obstructions that are 'ambiance' - barrels, wheelbarrows, just waiting to be tripped over.  Did I mention a young woman was taken from this place (some say kidnapped is a better word) and killed?  That's not on the advertisements, is it?Another ugh from me.  What a great concept gone horribly awry.  Queen Creek, how you need some great restaurants.  More power to those of you who love it, but next time the in-laws schedule a get together here, I'm calling in sick.Campfires, Steaks and Country Music...Well, I can do without the country music, but this place DOES set the mood for a 'home on the range' party.  I recently went here with my wife and her siblings and I was shocked.  I didn't know a place like this existed!Basically, it is a few buildings placed in a huge circle.  In the middle is where you eat and have campfires and party it up!  Picnic tables are randomly placed all over, and a huge stage is set in the middle.  This place is open VERY late and is great for groups.What makes this place so great? Fire! No I'm not a pyromaniac, but you go and get wood from a HUGE pile, you start a campfire in their metal ring pits, and then you go buy 'smores kits'... Yeah you heard me.  SMORES!  Smores and a full bar.  Could it get any better? Well, yes. actually. it can.The food here is amazing.  I ordered a huge T-Bone steak and it was delicious.  It comes with salad, bread, and a couple of sides.  It was cooked perfectly and the quality of the meat was outstanding.For originality, rugged location, and beautiful food, I highly recommend this place.Long before I was YELPING (is that really a verb?) I went to this establishment. I must confess that I really did not remember the experience. So with family in town, we decided to try it again. Before going, I read the reviews, I found myself confused with the mixed reviews. But after our experience, I now understand. This restaurant is for Atmosphere only!!! If you want a good dinner or good steak, go somewhere else. Now there are two ways to eat at this establishment: First--- Go to the sit down restaurant portion. Order from menu. Have food delivered like normal. Second-- Sit out at patio yard in back. To get food, you must go to walk up window, order and have food brought out. I am not sure if menu for this is the same for restaurant or not?? Now tonight, the Saturday before Easter we went to dinner. Figuring that it would be busy, we tried to go early, 5:00. But getting there about 30 minutes late, found that the parking lot was already very full and patio area was packed. Still having some lucky family genes, we found a parking spot right in front and were able to get seated at table in restaurant side immediately. 5 minutes later, I don't think we would have been that lucky... So when you see the reviews about parking and long waits, I understand their frustrations. Three of the four ordered Rib Eye steaks. The fourth a Jack Daniels Chicken. It is pretty tough to screw up a chicken breast so can't comment on that. However, the Rib Eye... Not worth the $18 price tag. Very POOR piece of meat and not cooked very well. I was up sold on the mushrooms, which were served on top. This did nothing to cover the poor quality of meat and poor cooking. Now I fancy myself a pretty good cook. I make a mean breakfast, do well on dinners, and do very well on the grill. So anytime I find myself thinking that I can do better at home, I know the food is not very good.... Service was average. Not sure the waitress even gave us her name. And was clearly too busy, with too many tables to provide quality attention. Maybe on a different night when things are not as busy, it might be better. But if the cut of meat is the same quality, I don't care what you do to it, how good your service person is, or how many mushrooms you put on top, it will still taste bad.  It will never be worth the $18 price. Three steak dinners, one chicken dinner one alcoholic drink for each, no dessert... Total bill $118.00 including tip... NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!I am sure the patio atmosphere would be very fun! Fires in pits, roasted marshmallows, and often times live music. So if you are looking for fun place to go with friends to enjoy an evening under stars, this might be the place. Want a good steak or other type meal... Go somewhere else...The Background:I live about 800ft from your establishment. I have visited with friends and family monthly (maybe even weekly) for the last 2 1/2 years. We are a family of 3 and generally meet 2 extra for dinner, 95% of the time we are a party of 5. Last time we visited we ordered a FULL rack of ribs, 2 filet steaks, 1 burger and 1 JD Chicken, plus side salads and drinks. I tipped my server over 30% (you can ask her) and I recommend you to everybody I know. Sometimes we are squished on a table for 4 and sometimes we are sat on a bigger table, I'm not bothered either way, it isn't Nobu, it's STF.This Evening's Visit:I arrived at 7pm and asked the hostess for a table for 6, she told me she would seat me once my other guests arrived and there was no wait. They were parking their car but once they arrived turned out there were only 4, making us a group of 5. The hostess then proceeded to tell me that we could no longer have one of the tables for 6 as we were only 5 so we would have to wait 45 minutes. I told her that we would squeeze onto a table of 4 and it was ok. I am unsure of how to describe what happened next, she told me that she was unable to seat us on a 4 table because they are for 4 people and she was unable to seat us on a 6 table as we were only 5 people and she was adamant we would have to wait 45 minutes to be seated. Confused? Yes I was too. At this point one of the lovely servers came over and said that we could squeeze onto a booth on her side, the hostess said no. I understand you have limited space but you weren't even busy!My Questions:I guess what I would like to know is do you cater to parties of 5? Is your seating arrangement simply about money? Is there any reason you will not seat 5 people on a table for 4 and is there any reason you will not seat 5 people on a table for 6 or more. I saw couples sat alone on tables for 4, tell me then how that makes sense, there are 2 wasted seats. Is this a new policy? Do you have a new manager? Is it policy to make customers feel uncomfortable and stupid? Is there a reason you have employed an arrogant young girl who is unable to crack a smile? The dining room had 6 fully cleared empty tables (2 tables for 4 and 2 tables for 6+) why couldn't I have one?Conclusion:So it's New Years Eve and I left almost in tears, I felt embarrassed having to do that in front of guests who had flown in from CT, and I felt upset that one of my favorite places has now started with this new attitude. When we left you still had a total of 6 empty tables and because of the mood of your 'hostess' you lost about $200. We went to Gordon Biersch, and luckily were able to save the evening, ironically sat on a table for 6. Our guests were disgusted and asked if that's how things happened in AZ. I have NEVER in all my years of traveling and eating out been made to feel so unwelcome. I am truly disgusted. I am so polite, never make demands, never make a fuss an am still sat here hours later scratching my head wondering what the hell that was all about. You should be honored that people choose STF as a place to spend their New Year and maybe think twice about placing an arrogant young girl as a hostess who is unable to solve even a simple problem.Dan P. wrote a very well thought out review that I agreed with upon my visit. So instead of just reiterating everything he said, I thought I would share it..."I ate here last night and I've never been to a place that has so much potential to be a destination restaurant only to have itself shoot itself in the foot. The owner has to be blind to not see what growth could come and business to be made if he just made a few minor changes.The atmosphere is unique and unlike anything out there. Roast your own s'mores for dessert? Hell ya! The live country music goes right in with the motif and the buildings surrounding you, damn, I felt right in my own wagon circle on the plains! Though I must admit, I don't think the cowboys nailed random revolutionary quotes and bill of rights amendments to every fixture they had. I came last night for a western experience, not to be lectured everywhere I looked like I was in high school history class.Sadly, everything else is so poorly thought out that the charm washes right off you. You stand in line for an hour just to ORDER the food, you still get asked for a tip even though there are no servers, 20 mins to wait for the food to get ready and you are prompted by a very not cowboy deli counter display, only to have you put your own toppings on. Shoot, for the $40 I paid, I could do that at fuddruckers and NOT pay a tip. I will say the burger was a good size and tasted on point, so there was a saving grace, but c'mon. No one wants to stand around waiting that long just to ORDER. I'd have rather had the typical sit down experience. Which, by the way, you are lucky to do if you aren't smart enough to have someone in your party save a table in the first place.If the owner reads this, here's a nickel worth of advice that will be a golden goose, I promise. Move the meat grilling outside, have at least five guys work the station, charge adults a flat $25, and make all of the sides buffet. What could be more western authentic than taking a giant spoon of baked beans and plopping it on your plate next to your ribs? Have fresh corn on the cob, potato salad, onion rings and fries and to top it off, a pot of chili which simmers all day. You have the right idea with the fires, now build on it and make the experience fully immersive! Then I don't care how much I paid for the food, I'd be having too much fun with the food!!!Sadly, I'm giving out my first two star review, not that it was terrible, but this place has too much potential to be something so so much more. At that's a damn shame. In fact, you guys might have just given me an idea worth investing in and I'll bet you I can pull it off with twice the profit. If you feel compelled to come here, go I guess, but I think you'll feel the same way: looks are one thing but execution will always win out."Just happened to be working in the area and needed something that I could eat in a hurry. This review is based on a lunchtime experience and does not reflect getting hammered and enjoying some live country music.This in one of those places where you go and get yourself a beer (several) and kick back while soaking up some really fun cowboy type atmosphere. The whole place is decorated with a nifty western theme and you will notice it in a heart beat.Came here for lunch and had to order at the bar. The usual ordering window was closed and there was no real servers for the tables. That's OK. The bartender was pretty cute and she kept me on my toes.Order a Mesquite Chicken sandwich that came with fries ($10). You can dress it up at the small condiment bar since it basically arrives naked. The sandwich was good but lacked enough chicken to completely cover the bun. The smokey mesquite flavor was probably the best part of the meal.This is what I call a cool tourist trap for those who really like the cowboy experience. There is a nice outdoor eating area with a large stage for live country bands. I'm assuming that they play during the nights and weekends?Give them a visit when you can't resist open air eating with a menu that is pretty basic to say the least. I do love music and can play a pretty good guitar myself. Unfortunately there was no music during my chow down and I couldn't drink any beers before going back to work. MORE COWBELL PLEASE!3 STARS

Review Text :
I have now been to both of the places named Dickeys in the greater Phoenix area.One, Dickies Dogs out in North Scottsdale would occasionally get my retox business, when we lived out that way...they were close to DC Ranch and close to the DC Ranch Village, so it made getting a hot dog easy enough:)Then people started throwing dynamite through the windows of Dickies Dogs in the middle of the night in a misguided attempt at extreme restaurant critiquing:)I quit going to Dickies Dogs when the possibility of getting fragged reared its ugly head!I'm thinking the guerilla critic might have been guilty of a case of mistaken identity (as well as multiple Class A federal felonies:(While Dickies Dogs made serviceable hot dogs, you really can't say the same about the "barbecue" from Dickeys Pit.I met a friend at Dickeys Pit yesterday for lunch and a business meeting...from the moment I walked in, I just sort of knew it was not going to go well for Dickeys Pit:(I took a look at the somewhat limited menu, while I sniffed in vain for the slightest hint of wood smoke in the air.Then I read their menu more closely.When they talk about how they make their "barbecue" at Dickeys, they talk about how they "cook" their meats "on the pit" overnight...wait a minute...that's not barbecue!I walked around to the side of the counter and saw the stainless steel "pit", over which they "cook" the meat...oh crap?!?!?At any rate, I was there and I was starving (power yoga and no breakfast make for an empty boy:) so I went ahead and ordered the pulled pork sandwich with "barbecue" beans.They brought out my sandwich, which had been "cooked on the pit"...sliced pork shoulder (not pulled pork) without so much as a hint of smoke, served with watery beans that had more in common with bean soup than with real barbecue beans...except without the flavor of good bean soup:(They have serve yourself barbecue sauce and I got regular and spicy sauce (the sweet sauce was almost like candy:(...and I slathered the spicy on my sandwich in an unsuccessful effort to get some flavor into the meat.It was just a sliced pork sandwich with second rate barbecue sauce poured over the top...it wasn't barbecue, pit or otherwise and it wasn't good:(The place is clean, modern, family friendly, pretty cheap and completely without redeeming value when it comes to the food they serve.I think the mysterious Mad Dickies Bomber might just have had the wrong Dickeys!Was getting my car washed next door and wanted to grab a bite to eat.  Since I love BBQ, this was an easy decision for me to give this place a shot.  After browsing the menu, I decided to try:4 oz BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich, $4.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z8Em-bhZI3Mmspml7tj6tg?select=Erry3muhVFQdFZQPCJRHzw2 oz Hot Link Sandwich, $3http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z8Em-bhZI3Mmspml7tj6tg?select=qxTdcqqimxhFcmoW1Iyj9gI got them both "dressed", which means they give you Onions & Pickles on the side to put on the Sandwich.Next to the Soda Fountain, there are vats of Hot & Mild BBQ Sauce for self service.  I of course went for the Hot BBQ Sauce.The food is delivered to your table when it's ready.  I went for the Hot Link Sandwich first and didn't put any Hot BBQ Sauce on it so that I could taste the natural Spiciness of the Hot Link.....well, I was disappointed, it's not very hot at all.  Damn, the search for real BBQ Hot Link Sandwiches continues.Next, I went for the BBQ Beef Brisket Sammie.....I poured some Hot BBQ Sauce and added the Onions & Pickles to it.  It's not a bad Sandwich.....pretty good.  I thought the Bread was a bit blah....like grocery store Bread......a nice Italian or French Roll would have been better with it.  The Beef was tender and juicy and had a slightly smoky flavor to it.  I prefer it to have a bit more flavor to it, but like how they serve you the Sandwich dry and allow you to put your own BBQ Sauce on it.The Hot BBQ Sauce was pretty spicy......really enjoyed that a lot.Overall, it was a pretty good experience.Return Factor - 71%

Restaurant name  Customshop Handcrafted Food
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Customshop is the type of place where you shouldn't get food "to go". The ambiance and service is too good to miss. The space and food quality are reminiscent of a Charleston Maverick restaurant, but more intimate and uniquely Charlotte in the commitment to locally grown fruits, vegetables and meats. Oh, and their WTF meats listed on the menu are actually from Wild Turkey Farms in China Grove, North Carolina, and does not stand for the other WTF you potty mouths were thinking. The cheese plates are lovely, and servers are well-versed in the choices and wine pairings. Try the Blu di Bufala (Water Buffalo) with local honey and Cremont Double Cream (Cow & Goat) cheeses for a pungent spin on typical cheese board offerings.There were several entrées that made the main portion of the meal difficult to choose; however, the house made Potato Gnocchi, Lamb Ragu & Merguez Sausage was ridiculously full of savory win. The Braised Beef Boneless Short Rib was gorgeously tender and flavorful, and nicely complemented by the Kale and Marmalade.Attentive service and intimate upscale digs round off the feel of Customshop, which in its entirety is an experience in which you'll want to paddle around within the lazy river of yum.Customshop is located at 1601 Elizabeth Avenue in a building that is over 100 years old, and amazingly hasn't been torn down and replaced by a big bank building and filled with men wearing blue button downs, as is the usual Charlottean custom.

just like Keith a pointed out here....(bunch of oldie pics/album covers plastered on the wall but all tables no booths )but to me it is a BIGGIE it is killing this place...no boothes no jukebox -thats what makes a diner a 50's diner, right??I came at 9 am on a Saturday and it was DEAD-2 other diners scattered in the very small open dining room of tables.The help was very friendly and fast, the food was terrific especially the spuds. The french toast was great, and so were the pancakes.We really enjoyed looking for Waldo in the mural of  a small 50's town painted across the entire wall on one side of the place.The whole time I couldn't get over the eery feeling that something had gone terribly wrong here because the place was empty but the food & service was great?? what's up with that?? did I miss something in the Taste section of the R-J??2nd time around this place is a great little breakfast spot. Never too crowded, very friendly service and great low cost food.They have like 35+ omelettes and lots of under $5 breakfast choices.Still missing the uniforms,jukebox and boothes but the food is the real deal.

Review Text :
I had so much fun here! Little food goes around in circles in front of you and no matter how much shit you grab, your bill ends up being like $8.  Okay that was an exaggeration. Maybe $12. I can see how the strongest arguments for a place like this would be price and convenience.  I'm an asshole so I look at it as a type of "Competitive Eating" environment where we are all racing to see who can make the highest plate tower. I realize I'm given a substantial advantage being as I'm the only who even knows the contest is going on, but it's still a challenge. What can I say? I enjoy challenging myself. It says so on my resume. But I digress.The food is okay. The nigiri is thin, but it's also $1 for two pieces, so I'm not going to complain. The rolls are basic but tasty. You only get 4 pieces on the plate, which is good for just one or two people because you can try stuff without committing to a whole roll. It's basically Sushi for Beginners rolling around on the conveyor belt and though I hear that you can special request things I haven't tried to do so yet. The highest priced plate is $2 so I'm not even sure something like Uni or Ikura is an option, though it would rock my world up if it was.Another fun thing about the belt is that it's not all sushi! During my visit there were little bags of trail mix, pieces of cheesecake, a can of V8 (wtf?), and little Japanese sodas all circling around, waiting to get picked up. I like this concept and feel it should be expanded to include shots, beers, Yoo-Hoos and those Lik-M-Aid things the ice cream man used to sell. Those things were so good.All in all, the food probably won't blow you away but it's fun and funny and you feel like you put one over on everyone when you eat 10 plates of sushi and your bill is only $13.50 including the can of V8. A-OK!I came here for lunch the other day and I liked it.  I didnt think the food was as zippy and flavorful as it could've been, but it all seemed perfectly fresh.  (And yeah, in case you wondered, my yardstick for a freshnes assesment on a sushi joint is if I had to spend that night curled up in the fetal position on my bathroom floor, white as sheet and drained of all color, weakly clutching a wastebasket and praying for the sweet, blessed release of death.  And the good news is that DEFINITELY didn't happen.)The food was cheap and I really appreciated that part of it as it's getting harder and harder to afford work lunches that consist of something more than a PB&J at my desk.  I think the most expensive item on the rotating sushi belt was about $3 a plate.  The service was friendly and prompt and I have no complaints there.  The only suggestion I'd make is to make sure to have your doors unlocked on the second that you advertise that you are open for business.  I walked up and tried the door at almost 5 minutes past 11:00 and it was still locked and I had to stand there like a fool waiting for someone to come and unlock it and let me in for lunch.  Overall not a big issue, just a minor observation.Anyway, this was a unique experience for a very small outlay of money, and for me that is a recipe for a return visit!  ;-)Went here 08/1/2013 place was shut down by the county and the notice said "Imminent Hazard".it appears they had refrigeration issues but still chose to stay open. Think about that. Sushi with out proper refrigeration? (Vomits). Never again, if you come here after knowing this you deserve a stomach virus.  They obviously don't care.BEWARE OF THE FRAUDULENT PRACTICES OF THIS BUSINESS!!!!I am absolutely FURIOUS! After receiving TERRIBLE service (on a Friday night, nonetheless), which included my server not bringing items that I ordered when the conveyor belt was empty, my friend and I both decided not to tip him because of his terrible service and attitude in response to our requests.Today, my friend checked her online statement for her credit card and found that she had been overcharged $2. I go online to check my statement to find that I had also been overcharged $2. Checking with the 3 other friends who ate with us and decided to tip the server, we were the only 2 who were charged an extra $2 on top of our bill. Furious, I called Teharu, was told that the manager was unavailable and proceeded to begin explaining my situation and was asked if I left a tip. I explained that I hadn't because I had received terrible service. In my opinion, by not leaving a tip I am helping my server to realize that he did a terrible job and he will therefore reevaluate his service and perhaps improve upon it. Being that many people comment on their subpar service that they receive here, the servers must not be tipped very well. Is this the way that Teharu responds? By overcharging customers illegally? When I sign a Merchant's receipt, I am agreeing to pay the amount that I write...NOT any more than that. It's no wonder that their service does not improve...Teharu is illegally making customers tip their servers (I bet we are not the only ones that this has happened to) which causes the servers in turn to have no incentive to improve their customer service.What upset me even more was that the woman on the phone said that there is "no proof" that I had been overcharged unless I bring in my receipt and bank statement, in which case they would refund $2 to my account. Obviously, it's only $2 so I'm not going to go all the way there just to get it back...I'll probably spend more on gas doing that. What infuriates me however is that when I explained that what Teharu did was ILLEGAL and FRAUDULENT, the woman on the phone was absolutely unfazed and did not seem to care about her business' immoral practices. Furthermore, my friend is a very light eater and $2 was nearly 33.3% of her bill. Imagine that - terrible service and a 33.3% tip? This business is absolutely terrible...I refuse to support a business that cheats customers out of their money by means of illegal and fraudulent practices.UPDATE: My friend spoke to the manager, who was apparently on break when I called earlier, and he said that he saw his worker on the phone with me and considered intervening (but didn't). The manager continued to claim that this was a "mistake" and that it happens "often". My friend said that he seemed concerned and wanted to help us by offering to refund us $2. However, we do not care about the money, but rather that this does not affect other people. Therefore, our concern is not about the fact that we were both overcharged, but rather that this business is not taking the necessary actions to ensure that their customers are satisfied and treated with honesty and respect. Being that the manager recognized that this is a problem that arises often, I do not understand why they are not taking this issue more seriously and investigating the source of this problem...if it happens so often, how is it an accident?! We expressed that we do not think that this is an accident in any way and that we will be contacting the police to investigate Teharu's fraudulent business activities. Furthermore, I have already submitted a complaint to the Better Business Bureau.If you have eaten at Teharu and paid via credit card, I highly suggest that you check your bank statement to see if you were overcharged. If you were overcharged, I hope that you will either comment on this post, submit a complaint to the BBB, or call the police directly as I will be contacting them shortly. I do not feel that anyone should sit by and allow a business to conduct themselves in this manner - it is not only wrong, but ILLEGAL and I am determined to put an end to Teharu's fraudulent practices.A last minute decision to come to Teharu Sushi turned out to be an awful one. It being a Sunday evening with a majority of restaurants closing early, we didn't have too many options so we came here.We arrived two hours before closing and the restaurant was empty with the exception of the very few tables occupied. There were 4 sushi chefs working behind the conveyor belt yet none of them welcomed any of us upon walking in.Having been to other rotating sushi locations in So Cal, Teharu sushi has limited options available and their kitchen items menu is pretty non existent. The plates cost between $1-$2. Everything on the belt was basic; California, spicy tuna, tempura shrimp, rainbow and spicy crab. In regards to the taste, the quality was poor as the seafood did not look fresh. Even the rice fell apart upon taking a bite.Service was extremely poor. The server kept forgetting our orders, accidentally dropped our order on the floor and at times had to be approach to ask for items such as more napkins and drink refills. With the manager sitting directly across from our table, she decided to ignore our party while she continued to dine on her meal though it was obvious we were frustrated with the lack of service and disappointment in food. Never would I return to such a place that could careless about the food they serve or paying customers.

I always love being pleasantly surprised. I love driving to Scottsdale Airpark for Indian food, expecting nothing special (as to not get my hopes up) and being very pleasantly surprised. Mr. Hottie was coming into town and I had Erin and Ayesha rounded up for dinner at another venue. Well, Mr. Hottie throws me a curve ball by texting me during a layover to state "I'm craving Indian food." I think to myself "Keep cool chica, sure you can find a good spot on last minute's notice!" So I hop on Yelp and try to find a good Indian joint that is NOT located in the East Valley. Yay! Indian Palace pops up on my search. Suh-weet! So I alert my girls of the venue change and off we go! When we arrived at the strip mall location, and walked in, I noticed how big the place was! It reminded me of a big warehouse that was converted into a restaurant. I was also hit with the smell of spices and gravies which was actually impressive because this was on the eve of the complete loss of my sense of smell and taste due to a terrible cold. The menu for dinner was quite large. I chose the Chicken Tikka Masala (my fave) while my dinner partners chose a few other dishes. Everything was delicious and made to order. I ordered my masala medium, while Ayesha ordered hers spicy and it seemed to come out as ordered. The one draw back that I had with this place is that they charge for rice to go with your meal, but we soon got over it and enjoyed our wonderful meal! I returned with Ayesha on a Sunday to try their lunch buffet. It was very good and large! For about 12 bucks, you had a choice of about 10-15 dishes, rice, naan, and a drink (champagne was an option for Sunday). On that day there was a very large birthday party being seated and I think they sat about 30-40 people with more revelers coming in the door. So, the restaurant is no small cafe, for sure! Indian Paradise is the place to go if you don't want to drive to Arizona's "Silicon Valley" (Chandler/Ahwatukee area). Their food is flavorful, and delicious. I look forward to trying them again very soon!We really enjoyed ourselves here last night. From the moment we stepped inside the service was impeccable - you can tell these guys are really serious. The menu is huge with dozens of dishes I have never encountered. Being our first visit we kept things simple with coconut chicken curry. Their hot sauce is wonderful, as is the unleavened bread and the hot carrots they start you out with. I will return. (FYI don't let the yelp picture fool you - the buffet is only available at lunch time)7/25/12Heard great things about Indian Paradise from good Yelp friends, and I thought it was about time I scratched this itch I had for Indian cuisine for many weeks.  I've passed IP many times before, noting it was on Hayden Rd, but never really memorized its location.  Disregard the directions from Navigation android app and follow Yelp directions, instead.  $10.95 gets you all-you-can-eat lunch buffet with fresh garlic naan and a glass of water.  All other beverages will cost extra.  I ordered a mango lassi for $4.  Buffet selections weren't many, but I managed to gather a varied plate http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg?select=d7H3JJ4h89IFRIFY0IA-7w#d7H3JJ4h89IFRIFY0IA-7w that consisted of (clockwise starting with) Tandoori chicken, Palak paneer, Chicken tikka masala, Dal tadka (yellow lentils), Dal makhni (red lentils), Chicken curry,  Paneer tikka masala (curd cheese in masala sauce), some shredded lettuce for texture (not pictured), mango and tamarind chutneys, and finally Gulab jamun for dessert.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg?select=SzJNBzvd9lXjaDhg9DMh7g#SzJNBzvd9lXjaDhg9DMh7g  The mango lassi was gorgeous, and better yet, it tasted fantastic!  Before I had a taste of it, a man who was passing by my table on his way out of the door stopped to ask what it was.  I guess he liked the look of it, as well.  I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loves mango lassis-- great mango flavor, a touch of sweetness, and a definite yogurt tang.  The naan took a long time to arrive, even after I sat down, asked for a lassi, first had a look at the buffet choices, and then proceeded to gather my plate and utensils before lining up to get food.  I had to wait another five minutes, maybe more, before it arrived on my table, which then allowed me to take a good photo to upload and THEN start eating.  The naan was warm, some parts were crispy, some parts were charred, and not very flavorful.  I couldn't detect a garlic flavor at all.  The dals were OK, the red saltier than the yellow, so I preferred the yellow.  I found the palak paneer to be tastier than the paneer tikka masala, which was salty, yet I found the paneer tikka masala's curd cheese cubes to be more tender, therefore more preferable; The cheese cubes in the palak paneer were rubbery.  The chicken curry was very appetizing!  Loved sopping up the sauce with the naan.  Perhaps the blandness of the naan was intentional, to make it a great companion to the sauces...  The tandoori chicken was very, very good, and perhaps the best I've tried anywhere.  Great smoke flavor, tender and moist-- I wouldn't mind ordering this for an entree.  I was already finished with lunch and wanted dessert (gulab jamun, rice pudding, or watermelon slices) when I spotted the chutneys, but I had some naan left, so I thought to try them out.  The mango chutney looked wonderful, and made me wish I had pancakes or crispy waffles to eat it with.  Before trying it with naan, I spooned a little bit into my mouth and found it to be quite salty, so it wouldn't do well for a sweet snack, unless you like sweet and salty (and I do on occasion, but not in mango chutneys).  The tamarind chutney, more syrup than chunky chutney really, was definitely sweeter.  The gulab jamun rounds were tougher than others I've tried; I kept wishing the centers were creamier/silkier.  I liked the sweet milk flavor, although the syrup wasn't scented with rosewater or saffron.  I'd say pass on these last three and save your calories for a lassi!

Dry tasteless salmon.  And...we waited 20 minutes for this  fish, without any drinks...because the waitress forgot what we ordered.     Gosh and I  was so starved after the long drive, and this place appeared to look good.   Nice waitress...but she forgot everything everyone ordered several times.  She forgot the drinks and silverwear.  I used the silverware from another table.

I've been coming here for 24 years now which should tell you right away of how great the sandwiches, soups, milkshakes and salads are.More than once I've brought out of town guests here and they always, without fail, are impressed with the food, the presentation and the atmosphere. The garden in the back is by far the best place to sit during the hot summer months but the seats inside are just as cozy in the winter time. Prices have been steadily going up over the years but the place still somehow manages to rely that hippy-Boho vibe it's always had.  I'm not going to tell you which sandwich to get, my favorite changes constantly over time but you can't go wrong with the traditional flavors. Their originals have some unusual combinations here but they are always quite tasty like the Killer Tomato, Sweet Root and Pepper Island. I know I'm weird in saying this but sometimes it's the basic ingredients in the construction of any one dish is what either makes it or breaks it and in this case , it's the bread. No joke.Once you start coming here, make a mental note of this place. You'l be coming back all the time.

I consider it comfort food.  Quick warm stuff that will make me happy for less than $10.When I got off the plane - I was hungry, I didn't really like the airplane food and was just hungry.  The bus that was taking us dropped us off at the hotel and I dropped my tush down as quickly as I could here as I could smell some warm food.I did get so quickly a hot dog, onion rings and pepsi- I was just happy.Later that week- I was feeling like an upset stomach coming on...so I went there and got a saimin.  Warm broth and good noodles that taste just like noodles from Honolulu.  Needless to say- I felt better.It's not the healthiest food- but it tastes good and to me is comfort food.Nice service and quick.  Really all I wanted just to get me to my next meal.This is located in the California Hotel Casino in Downtown it's downstairs near the craps tables. Here you can get snacks from hot dogs, burgers, saimin, spam musubi's and sushi. It's like a fast food take out thing but there are tables to eat at too. Not the best due to you can get better stuff upstairs at Aloha Specialities. But when hungry and don't wanna wait in lines or crowded restaurants there then this will hold you up for a while.Picked up some dinner to go. We wanted to take food back to the room. Originally I wanted fried saimin but they ran out of noodles! Boo! How do they run out of noodles? The next best choice was the bento box which consists two scoops of rice, Chicken katsu, one piece of fried spam, and beef teriyaki. The chicken Katsu was crunchy. It didn't come with the sauce, so make sure you get the sauce where the condiments are. My daughter even like the chicken Katsu. The beef teriyaki was tender and melted in my mouth. Spam was cooked to a crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. The rice was perfect consistency. It wasn't too soft or mushy. Food was descent. There are a few tables within this small establishment. It wasn't too crowded when we got our food but the line was slow because there's only one cook who takes your order. You basically order and then pay at the end of the line. They even sell the Hawaiian Sun drinks! We had drinks in the room. Food was descent but the teriyaki meat just melted in my mouth. So good. Chicken Katsu was crunchy. I recommend these two items. I wish they didn't run out of noodles. Maybe next time.

I've never had a worse experience at a restaurant than i had here..even mcdonalds would have been better. we came here as a last resort because the breakfast club was overcrowded, and ive heard they have great mimosa's and bloody marys which was exactly what we were looking for. i tend not to dine in scottsdale at these kind of places because of the overtanned, over-steroided, bejeweled-wearing, snotty environment. first off, there was a long wait - we were offered a free round of drinks on the house because of this...the bartender was new, so when we ordered she neglected to tell us about the different kinds of mimosas and bloody marys they offer...and they are only $2 until 3pm which was a pretty slick deal. try the fallen angel bloody mary, it's made with chipoltle and jalepeno. delicious.while we were waiting, a group of the typical scottsdale bitches and bros walked in and just decided to seat themselves like they owned the fuckin place, while we kindly sat and waited. and don't even get me started on how many dirty looks my girlfriend and i got while we were waiting...ugh.we finally got seated after 30 mins of waiting, and our waitress was very friendly and apologetic about the whole situation. we ordered the breakfast sandwhich and steak and eggs. the food didn''t come out for 45 minutes. forty five fucking minutes! the table of bitches and bros even got served way before us. and the food was COLD, and my bacon was not how i ordered it. my girlfriend had them re-make her dish, which took like 15 minutes and they STILL left off my bacon. we got offered free shots, and had several people come up to us and offer their condolences. what the fuck ever, there is no excuse for shitty service like we received. they ended up comping our food, but we still had to pay for drinks and dessert (the cookie with peanut butter was alright). the main bartender told us he was going to get us another drink on the house, and never came back with it. the manager/owner also claimed he would be back with a card for us, and never came back with that.it was also SO FUCKING LOUD in there (there was a football game) and they had the volume turned up so high i couldnt even hear my girlfriend speak and she was sitting right next to me. i was looking for a cure for my hangover with steak, eggs, and a bloody mary and this place just made it that much worse and ruined my first day of the new year.HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!Yell at me, call me names, beat me up, just PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't make me go back to Saddle Ranch!!  Ick from beginning to end.  I made the mistake of bringing a couple out of town buyers here last night, a Monday mind you, thinking it would be fun and kitchy.  You know, they could watch a couple lushes get on the bull and made fools of themselves and fall off, rustic cowboy atmosphere, good enough for entertaining out of towners anyways.Oh how wrong was I??  Just my luck it was their 1 year anniversary party and the placed was packed.  And packed with the worst kind of people.  It looked like a Real World casting call had thrown up all over the bar.  Skanky, underage girls literally falling over chairs, and being annoyingly in the way all the time.  Oh, and I'm pretty sure that all the steroids ever injected in AZ were in that bar too.  And get this, they were all wearing crystals on their shirts...puke.It took FOREVER to get served at the bar which we obviously didn't stay at long because my clients wanted to get the hell out of there ASAP.The only reason in gets any stars at all is because I cannot entirely turn my back on any place that serves cotton candy.  That would be the 5 year old in me : )(I have not ate at this Saddle Ranch. This review is for SR on weekend nights after 10 pm).You will like Saddle Ranch in Old Town Scottsdale if you are:A creepy middle aged guyA creepy douchebagORAn attention seeking skank of a female who likes to ride mechanical bulls in super short dressesSeeing as how I am none of those, I dislike Saddle Ranch as a bar/late night destination. Plus the bar service sucks and you can get cheaper beer at other places.It was Sunday in America, our nieces had packed up and headed back to their respective parents (fueled by a hypergolic combination of maple syrup and chocolate leftover from Easter...I have no idea how they got their little hands on all that sugar and chocolate) and the Beautiful Carin and I were, once again, free birds!http://tinyurl.com/ca67ffWe decided a celebration was in order...we love our nieces and nephews, make no mistake (in fact, "Auntie Carin" is a family legend...the good kind) but it's always good to rev the kids up and then send them back to their mommies and daddies...kind of a practice session for when we have grandkids.After everyone was gone, we decided a big ol' breakfast/brunchy meal was in order and since I had a Groupon for Saddle Ranch...well, you see where this is headed, don't you?The joint was really jumpin'...I mean for a lazy Sunday in America, it was really going strong...we soon found out why..."Babes on Bulls"...adorable young ladies, in the fullest bloom of babehood were going to be riding the bull, while wearing very little in the way of clothing!Is there a better way to spend a lazy Sunday morning/early afternoon than eating too much, having a few cocktails and watching live softcore?I don't think so, either!Babes on Bulls was a charity event...I have no idea what the charity was, but Carin and I donated, anyway...if only because the name of the event reminded me of the last great cinematic feature I saw...I think the movie was called "Babes on Bob"...there was a little riding going on in that movie, too!A huge and pretty tasty breakfast of steak and eggs, hash browns, biscuits and half a six pack of Devilish Something Bloody Mary's later, I was ready for the showAnd what a nice little show...Babes rode the mechanical Bull...lot's of "yee-haw's"...lots of jiggling...lots of hootin' and hollerin' from the crowd...in short, pretty much exactly what you expect when you walk into SRCH!Sure, there are better breakfasts around...even some within my walking radius...but...SRCH is pretty decent  grub and better than average drinks and service (I mean, these people are always smiling and friendly) and ..."Babes on Bulls"...I mean come on!I'm giving Saddle Ranch three stars because as a restaurant, this is a fun option if you're looking for a casual atmosphere with decent food, but as a bar, it's just ok and good for crazy nights on the town when you're looking for a mechanical bull and strong drinks. Beware of massive food portions! The food comes out on large skillets and many of the meals take up the entire plate. They have great breakfast with everything imaginable, including $1.99 Mimosas. For lunch/dinner, the have salads, wraps, burgers, steaks and more. They serve tasty biscuits and cornbread with every meal and they always seem to add a special treat to the meal whether it's a shot or over-sized martini glass full of cotton candy. The drinks definitely flow here at Saddle Ranch. They have everything from carafs of fruit cocktails to liters of beer. I can handle Saddle Ranch anytime before 10 PM. Before 10 PM, it's a lively restaurant that provides a social atmosphere for some eating and drinking. After 10 PM it turns into a scene straight from a bachelor or bachelorette party. It's the perfect spot if you are a part of either of those parties or looking to pretend like you are, but this isn't the spot you choose for a casual night on the town. This is the bar you choose if you want to throw back shots for hours and ride a mechanical bull while hundreds of people watch.The last two times I've been to Saddle Ranch, it's been disappointing. Both times, my group and I arrived during dinnertime and asked to be seated inside for dinner. When we arrived, the entire restaurant was practically empty and yet both times, they told us that the wait was 45 min- an hour due to "reserved parties." Yet like I said, nobody was there and in the time we were there, I never saw one "reserved party" arrive. While the wait to sit inside was 45 min - an hour, coincidentally enough, they always have seating available on the patio which is where they seated everyone who were walk-ins. Since we were hungry, we ended up sitting out on the patio and the seats inside remained empty for the majority of the time we were there. Do they want people to sit on the patio to make it seem like more people are at Saddle Ranch then really are? Who knows, but when it's that hot it's too to eat outside. I understand that restaurants get crowded, but we've now come to Saddle two times and have been told it's too full to be seated inside both times and we could either wait an hour, leave or sit on the patio in 115 degree weather. Next time I will probably choose another restaurant to visit when it's time to pause the Saturday activities and have a bite to eat in a lively setting. Instead, I'll keep this place on my list when I need a spot for a rowdy night out and I don't need sit-down service.

We wanted to find a restaurant within Lake of Las Vegas, since that is where our cousins are staying with a 2 month old.  After giving up on finding a 4 star place to eat within the area, Earl made an executive decision to try out Sonrisa.  When we arrived on a Friday at 6:30ish pm, there were not many people at Lake of Las Vegas.  It was very dead.  When we got to the restaurant, there were not many guests there either.  The food was mediocre at best.  I got the avocado rolls, Earl got the...I don't even remember.  It was so unmemorable.  Earl asked the waitress if they make good Michelada.  She said yes with confidence.  When she brought out the michelada, the color was off.  It was no bueno.Summary:  We won't be coming back.

Great choice in choosing a spot to open your 3rd location, Grazie!~ DC Ranch can totally use another pizza place on this side of town!When Jared and I decided to go grab some dinner last weekend, we had no idea that Grazie would be so crowded - after all, this place just opened!  Well, word has gotten around, because it was a zoo!  We waited a few minutes for a table... and were both pleased to be seated inside shortly after.  The acoustics in the restaurant were not great.  We couldn't hear each other speaking let alone the music playing amongst all of the chatter.  Aside from that, we had a great meal...I actually met Jared at the Old Town Scottsdale location of Grazie almost 2 years ago, so it kind of holds a special place in my heart.  It's a consistent, laid back, old standby for pizza, salad, wine, and that amazing 'dolce della casa' dessert of theirs.  During this visit, we mixed it up a little and went with an order of the eggplant parm or 'melanzane parmigiana' as they call it; in addition to sharing a large insalata della casa.  I hate to say it, but stick with the pizza... the eggplant breading stood out more than anything in the dish... don't get me wrong, it was good, but the pizza is probably a better choice.  Of course, even though I begged Jared not to order that dessert, he went for it... and sure enough, I have no will power, and I ate my fair share.  I have to say - it's frickin' good too!  Don't ever tell me the nutrition info; i don't want to know it.  The ingredients make me feel guilty enough; it's a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with chocolate hazelnut sauce and banana and topped with vanilla ice cream.  Talk about a splurge!  And of course I took a huge bite just as I was tapped on the shoulder by a friend I hadn't seen in awhile - how embarrassing!  I think i was drooling chocolate at that point!So, all in all - Grazie is great... I am sure I'll be back to this and the Old Town location.  I do have one suggestion other than the acoustics in this place.  Please add protein options as add-ons to the salads!  (IE: grilled chicken, shrimp, salmon, and turkey).  If you had these options, I'd go more often for lunch and not feel like I was completely splurging with every visit!Lastly, if you go to Grazie, make sure to request Kaycee as your server - she's fabulous, and she's a fellow yelper!

It's the most unfortunate of days when something you love betrays you. I absolutely loved their pizza. Sauce was sweet and delicious. I always recommend them to people looking for a pizza. But today was dooms day. After a long day at work I didn't wanna do anything expect watch the walking dead and cuddle and binge on some pizza and wings. We waited close to an hour for the food to arrive which I didn't mind cause like I said, I loved them. Walking up the steps to my apt a roach crawls up and out of the pizza box. I swear on everything holy. So I call them and tell them and to my surprise they don't even argue it they tell me to come get my money back. So already fuming I drive downtown from south side and get stuck in traffic in the 10st tunnel. When I get there we simply received an "I'm sorry" and a refund. What? Is that really all you had to say? A roach crawled out of my pizza box! Needless to say I'm never eating there again. Traumatized. I took my refund and went to Luke Wholeys and that kicked butt! My review for that soon to come haha.

I picked up take out from Chef Chiang yesterday.  $6.95 for the hunan chicken lunch special.  It comes with the entree, white or fried rice, egg drop or hot & sour soup, one crab rangoon, one fried wonton filled with some indistinguishable meat and one thin fried thing filled with cream cheese and possibly something else but I couldn't really taste anything besides cream cheese.The crab rangoon had no discernable crab flavor.  If I had sent it off to a lab they may have found some I suppose.  The entree was soupy.  Very soupy.  The sauce was ok...nothing special.  It was a little spicy.  The veggie assortment in the chicken dish was pretty minimal and the only thing that tasted fresh was a little bok choy.I don't care for egg drop or hot & sour soup so I won't comment on that.  I didn't eat the egg roll.  It looked overdone & greasy.I probably won't go to Chef Chiangs again.  Mediocre at best.

We stopped in here tonight to grab some kona coffee ice cream draped in hot fudge and there were a few issues, so I'm deducting one star. 1) They had a small acoustic group performing that was 70's wonderful but they were so loud we literally had to scream our orders to the staffer. 2) The staffer was either new, or short bus special, because we had to tell him that the whole point of ordering a sundae was to get the toppings (he didn't offer and I wasn't paying $5.25 for two scoops of ice cream). 3) The previously larger than life scoops have experienced significant shrinkage. They really aren't even normal size scoops anymore. 4) Some how my $5.25 sundae came out to $6.27 after tax. I know AZ is experiencing a budget crisis, but there is no way that taxes have gone up that much, so I must conclude that I was overcharged. 5) The place was so full of Zpizza customers listening to the music that there was literally nowhere to sit, unless we went to the noticeably empty pizza side. The result was not only a complete invasion of my personal space (I simply don't like rubbing up against strangers just to get to the counter unless I'm at a bar) but it also created a really strange odor comprised of pepperoni and sugar... far from appetizing. All in all, the visit was a complete disappointment - but the band was great.How about G Spot baby!? These little ice cream sammies, are not so little actually, and have always hit my G Spot! Get your mind outta the gutter my yelpitas! By G Spot, I mean Goodie Oh So Goodie Spot. And ice cream always hits that spot. The cookies are first rate and the ice cream, while no Marble Slab or Cold Stream Creamery, makes those packaged Nestle Tollhouse numbers at the QT quiver in dairy shame! I've been here a few times an hour or so before closing and they're already swabbing the deck and having the "we're closing in 50 minutes vibe, so go to Safeway and get some Ben and Jerry's"...hate that! And hope my staff doesn't give off that aura. Tonight I had a ZPizza delivered WITH Pink Spot yummies and Mr. Gonzales and I are very happy. And full. So four stars to ice cream sammies DELIVERED in Phoenix. Come on, how cool is that?I am slightly confused as to what this place is.Is it a coffee shop? yes.Is it an ice cream parlor? well..yes.Is it an antechamber for the hair salon upstairs? kinda.Seemingly the Pink Spot *giggle* is trying to be a few things at once, and vaguely succeeding at those goals.I like the Pink Spot *giggle* for a number of reasons:-location-convenience-ambience-selectionIn all honestly it isnt the best coffee shop that the area offers, but It's another option- and that my friends, is a corner stone of capitalism: consumer choice.Now I won't be making the Pink Spot *giggle*, my local haunt, that spot belongs to Lola, and I would never cheat on my beloved tranny. But for those special nights when I get the strange urge for simultaneous brain freeze and a scalded tongue, i'll go down on the Pink Spot...*giggle*

Review Text :
This could've easily been a four-star review!  Thin-crust pizza lovers- you will love Crust's thin-crust. I ordered a personal-sized bianca ($8.50)- a four-cheese (mozzarella, ricotta, romano, and parmesan) with garlic and marinated tomatoes on a default white dough (Crust offers wheat crust by request!).  Others have mentioned the pizza's phallic appearance- I don't think it does look like one, but I do think it looks ugly.  Almost a turn-off, actually, but once I took a bite of that crust, I was hooked!  I almost went for the special (I was told on the phone that it was an all-day affair) of a slice of pizza, salad, and drink for $6.50, but upon inquiring came to find out that it was only the cheese pizza (Crust's house- mozzarella and house marinara) with a side salad (I was hoping it would be my choice of their salads, as some places do offer this option).  Upon my mention of the special, Mitch (my server who was also the bartender) had the specials board erased.  So much for the info I was given over the phone.  So why three stars and not four?  I had to ask for bread to be brought to the table (slightly sweet with great textures), which isn't a big deal as most places are doing that these days, but it would be nice if it was offered, instead of my asking since I had already barraged the poor guy with so many questions.  I'd asked for the wine list and couldn't find any mention of any wine-by-the-glass offered during happy hour (only beers), so I had to hail Mitch over again to ask about that.  FYI, Crust offers a merlot and a pinot grigio, each $6, during HH.  I was very curious to find out what ingredients were used in the making of their meatballs (for possible allergens), but I decided to save that question for my next visit.  When I asked for a box for the leftovers, the slices were returned to me sitting on a paper plate and placed inside a tented brown paper bag- this wouldn't do as I had other errands to run before returning home, so I asked for a closed container.  Thankfully, Mitch remembered about the to-go pasta rounds.I inquired earlier if the cannoli filling was made with powdered sugar, and Mitch assured me that it wasn't, so I had a mini-cannoli for dessert.  $1.25 will get you one that is about 2.5 inches in length and about an inch in diameter.  The filling's a little sweeter than other cannolis I've had, but still very good!  I really liked the shell- crunchy, light and flaky, without a greasy aftertaste!  (No grease on the fingers, either!)Restroom was clean and spacious.  The pizzaiolo was friendly and greeted everyone hello and goodbye.  I'll definitely visit again!9/15After ordering take-out from Goldman's Deli, I decided to stop at Crust to try their happy hour (50% off all apps and a few alcoholic beverages, with 50% off glasses of wine).  Even though I arrived 15 minutes before happy hour (4:30p start till 6:30p?), Mike, one of the owners/chefs told me I could order off the menu.  How nice of him!A coworker testified that the filet mignon sliders were pretty good, so I chose the small plate (3 sliders), originally $11, and a glass of Riesling.  While I waited for the sliders to arrive, I devoured the deli sandwich from Goldman's (loved the textures and flavors, but not the price!).  The sliders arrived after about fifteen minutes- not too long for what was to be one of the best sliders I've tasted in recent memory!  Loved the crunchy exterior of the bread, as well as the color.  (I took some home to enjoy at a later date, and I'm happy to say they were just as great re-heated in the toaster oven!)  The filet mignon strips were very tender and juicy, and the accompanying horseradish cream sauce was splendid!  Not a drop of it was left on my plate, this I can assure you  :)  Oh, and what about the au jus?  I only tasted saltwater with a little bit of meat essence.  Pass.  The sliders and cream sauce were flavorful enough to make the au jus unnecessary.You'd think that half a deli sandwich and three steak sliders would've been enough, but rich entrees (and the cream sauce was very creamy and rich) usually make me crave for something sweet, so I went ahead and placed an order of the nutella pizza (same Rustica crust, with nutella, sliced strawberries and banana, and dollops of vanilla bean ice cream), minus the banana.  Please note that there is at least a fifteen-minute wait for this OUTSTANDING hazelnut and chocolate pizza.  Oh my...  I'd come back just to order it again and ravage it all by myself =)10/12Happy 2nd anniversary, Crust!To celebrate Crust's 2nd Ann'y, the entire menu, minus hard liquor, was going for 50% off today!  I decided I'd order my fave Rustica bianca, as well as two other selections I've wanted to try: the Crusted Mac 'n Cheese and the Pasta alla Forno.  The mac 'n cheese is too-die-for!  Love that crust topping and toasted cheeses- count 'em, there's five: fontina, velveeta, romano-pecorino, parmesan, and cheddar?  I'll have to double-check sometime soon ;)  The Pasta alla Forno is also very tasty; the peas lend the dish a sweetness that I like.  Oh, but the mac 'n cheese...  For dessert, I'd ordered the Nutella pizza, but with everything included (I was going to try eating bananas again).  I forgot to stipulate "no powdered sugar," so after the 15-minute wait, I was presented this pretty dessert pie, but I couldn't enjoy it due to all the powder.  It was promptly removed, but I'd have to wait another 40 minutes for a new batch (the resto was packed).  I must've had a pretty sad face on while waiting for my ticket, bec. Mike came out and offered me a complimentary mini-cannoli.  I was still pretty sad about missing out on all of that Nutella goodness, but after a couple of cannoli bites, I was once again my happy self :D  BTW, the leftovers warm up well!10/27OK, I've decreed that Crust is my favorite pizza and wine restaurant!  (That is, until a few friends prove to me otherwise that there are better NY-style/thin-crust pizza joints in the valley.)  Not only does Crust offer up super-crispy and flavorful Rustica pizzas ("hand-stretched"), but their 20" thin-crust round pies (I've tried the Little Nicky- white pie w/ fresh spinach and tomatoes) and pasta dishes (crusted mac 'n cheese is delicious both fresh and re-heated) are good, too!I am IN LOVE w/ Crust's filet mignon sliders w/ horseradish cream sauce.  This time the au jus reduction was SUBLIME, and oh so garlicky!  I was told that the "regular" chef was working that day.  To the unnamed chef, I salute you!  :)  The table bread, which you will have to specially request or you won't get any, was great w/ either butter or dunked into the au jus.  MMmm!As if the steak sliders and the decadent cream sauce ($4.50 for 3 pcs, HH menu) weren't enough- I've got to find out where I can get my hands on those buns these sliders are served on!- I went ahead and ordered a pot of brownie sundae ($9.50).  This was my first time ordering the brownie sundae and had not realized it came served in a mini-caulderon-style pot.  Should you decide to order this sweet, make sure you have at least two other tablemates w/ you to share the wealth!  The walnut brownie came w/ sliced bananas, fudge sauce, and a scoop of ice cream and then topped w/ homemade whip cream and a maraschino cherry!  If you're a sundae fan, you'll love this delectable sweet pot!Addendum 10/30:So why not 5 stars?  The atmosphere here isn't as inviting as it could be.  I never minded much about this quality until I spent happy hour with three friends at Cork last night.  (What a beautiful and cozy space Cork has!  Cork review coming soon!)  I'm assuming it's intentional- this being a pizza and wine cafe, the owners want quick turnovers.  Am I right?  Hmm...8/28, 9/11, 10/1, and 10/12Crust is still in my regular rotation, no surprise to some of you, I know... After a few updates, I usually won't add another review unless I try something worth yelping about!  Aug. 28th's Rustica Bianco was definitely a joy to experience!  Or perhaps I'd stayed away too long?  No, this pie really stood apart from the previous Rusticas I've ingested, and I believe it was the added seasoning I detected that I'd never seen before (and didn't see again in the pies that followed).  9/11 was the day Mom and I tried a couple of new items- new to us, that is- the Eggplant parm, which was served in a crust.  I was speechless!  Mom was enjoying her Spinach salad (we ordered it w/ a crust), and didn't care to try the eggplant.  She did, however, tear off a couple of pieces of  the entree's crusty bowl.  This dish is best eaten fresh from the oven, so bring a couple of friends to help you polish it off!  I also learned of the arrival of Nick's (correct me on the supplier's name if I'm wrong, Mitch!) Gelatos on this visit... I was given the green light to sample as many flavors as I'd wanted... I'd enjoyed so many flavors, it was hard to choose one to take back to the table!  We tried a new Rustica variety on 10/1- the Bella Rossa (again, new to us...).  This pizza was absolutely a beauty to behold, and I really enjoyed the wheat crust-- this is the only Rustica variant that is served on wheat.  However, we both found it too salty, which we credited to the presence of olives in the pesto sauce and the sun-dried tomatoes.  Almost docked this review a star, but decided the effort was there, and that wheat crust...  10/12 marked Crust's 3rd ann'y, and I wanted to help Crust celebrate!  Crust's expansion proved to be a smart move, but I couldn't help thinking perhaps Crust should've gone for even more square footage!  The turnout was just unbelievable!  And to mark the special day, I chose two specialy entrees to try: one I'd had my eye on since first visiting Crust a couple of years ago (Sausage, Spinach, and White Beans pasta), and one Mitch is particularly proud of- the Chicken Francese pasta.  We both loved the sausage entree!  I adored the light garlicky sauce, and we both thought the presence of white beans ingenious!  The beans not only enhanced all the other flavors in the dish, but also added a hearty texture that we found very pleasing!  This entree also proved to survive reheating the next day.  Sadly, I've had to give up chicken as a meat option, so it was up to Mom to give me all the details, which I had to wait for until the following night, bec. she'd eaten her fill of Rustica Bianco!  Great news, Mitch-- Mom loved this dish!  The battered and pan-fried chicken cutlets were juicy and paired well w/ the beurre blanc sauce.  No wonder you're a proud Papa!Four dining events marked by new flavors worthy of a Yelp, and a higher rating!An absolutely awesome little spot tucked away in a stripmall which proves that great food can found in the most unassuming of locations!The pizzas are outstanding, most notably the thin crust pies. The sauces are beautifully balanced, the cheeses properly dispersed and the salumis perfectly crisp and juicy. Along with a nice red you cannot go wrong.Our server was also one of the owners and he was incredibly helpful and friendly. I left feeling like we were long lost friends, and I felt like my dollar and patronage really mattered. Find this place and you will find a great dining experience. And eventhough it's small, they take kindly to kids, which us a bonus when my son and I have pizza night.10/24/12Crust celebrated its 5th year anniversary today, and as it has in the past four years, it did so by offering 50% off everything on the menu, dine-in only.  Glasses of wine and and a handful of cocktails were also offered for $5 each.  We celebrated by ordering a Strawberry salad, Meatball sliders http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=skLo5ITLHCYc-7KTQ097pQ#skLo5ITLHCYc-7KTQ097pQ, Filet mignon sliders http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=9NBWbmur1iGAYDRAQyfP6w#9NBWbmur1iGAYDRAQyfP6w, a Rustica Bianca (sub artichokes for the tomatoes, $1.50 extra) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=gBqV2d_OzEapAwM7Ih7EIw#gBqV2d_OzEapAwM7Ih7EIw, two glasses of Mango moscato, and a glass of Hey Mambo, a red blend.  Oh, and an order of Warm chocolate chip cookies and ice cream sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=85Xw1x9f7gzbpLARkjZEhg#85Xw1x9f7gzbpLARkjZEhg.  All were, of course, delightful, although the rustica wasn't as crispy as Mom and I wanted it.  No matter, as I pointed out that we can toast the leftover pizza at home and just enjoy the other items we ordered at the restaurant.  An hour and a half later, our stomachs full, my wallet $72 lighter (which included a $17 tip), and my ears ringing from the deafening noise indoors (my second complaint, which I can overlook on this special date), we left happy and contented.  Thank you, Crust!  Congratulations again to Mitch, Michael, and Duke, and everyone else at Crust, for yet another anniversary milestone, and we hope you have many more!2/19/134.5 stars.Received a text** from Crust alerting that all entrees were $10 each (dine-in only), so I stopped by after work.  Having combed the menu during one of my breaks, I knew I was going to try two new (to me!) pasta dishes, the Ravioli Pesto Cream and Grandma's Pasta, and a half (crustless) Tuscan salad.I was welcomed immediately when I entered and was seated.  My server came by shortly with a glass of water and asked if I'd like to order anything else for dinner, so I asked to try a sample of the week's special red blend before I ordered a full glass.  I've rarely been disappointed with their selections, and sure enough, I liked what I tried and asked for a glass.  I placed my food order, tweaking the Ravioli dish a little by asking that the kitchen sub out the usual chopped fresh tomatoes for artichokes (I'd asked Mitch on the phone earlier if this would be OK, and he said "no problem") and asked if I could have some table bread, as well.Ten minutes passed, and I still hadn't received any bread, nor the small crustless salad I'd ordered, but I was reading while I waited, so I wasn't too worried, although I did ask a passing server to see what was going on.  Around five to ten minutes later, my dishes arrived, and these came with a dinner roll each, so the missing bread was forgotten (although it's always nice to have some extra to enjoy at home).  The salad was still missing, so when my server came by for a check-up, I mentioned it, and he said he'll look into it.  A few minutes later, a full order of a Tuscan salad arrived.  (Because of the mix-up, the salad was on the house- thanks Crust!)The Pesto Ravioli Cream with artichokes was terrific! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=FxAhyaHn1yiexaqxjH5P3w#FxAhyaHn1yiexaqxjH5P3w  When I order creamy dishes, whether it's Italian, or Thai, I like the sauces silky and rich in flavor, and this dish certainly fulfilled my expectations.  The ravioli was cooked al dente (perfetto!), and the tangy artichokes served to cut the buttery richness of the sauce.  I LOVED every bite!  The sauce also went well with the dinner roll.  Squisito!  As for Grandma's Pasta http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=Ip7IWfw0zSUc3hHg8Ni5bQ#Ip7IWfw0zSUc3hHg8Ni5bQ, I can take it, or leave it.  One problem I had with it was that the ricotta was too cold, and I found the clash of hot and cold in this pasta dish a little strange.  I also found that the small chunks of sausage were much tastier than meatballs, and I found myself wishing the dish just contained sausage links, instead of the meatballs, which is a shame, since the meatballs are HUGE!  Last, but not least, the Tuscan salad was delicious!  Loved the peppery arugula, dressed in a housemade Italian vinaigrette, and the white beans, and when I read "homemade croutons," I expected the usual cubed chunks of bread, not the toasted and seasoned slices of bread that adorned the bowl.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=h8xkl7KOxVxNx5r7m86lyg#h8xkl7KOxVxNx5r7m86lyg  I could order this salad as an entree and a glass of white and be happy!With so many dining options to choose from in this valley of the Sun, it's great to know that whenever I do dine at Crust, dinner specials or not, I can always find a great meal and walk out happy and satiated!**To receive Crust specials via SMS, text CRUST to 91944.Though most flock to Crust for the pizza and pasta, sometimes a salad is in order. Gotta eat healthy(ish) every few meals, right?Good news - Crust serves salads as well. Meal-sized portions that could satisfy even zealous appetites like mine. This summer, Crust is serving a kale and apple salad that comes highly recommended. Yes, you heard it here first, I'm actually suggesting that you order a dish with kale as the main attraction.Served with shredded chicken and a dollop of goat cheese on top, this green concoction had just the right leafy:meat ratio. And the bowl was very generous, kept this girl satisfied until dinnertime. My dining companion enjoyed the Greek salad, which comes in its own crusted bread bowl. You can literally eat your way in and out of this salad. Very nice, attentive service and a pretty quick lunch, which is important on a weekday.

Review Text :
Laloux is a Montreal institution, and it's evident why as soon as you walk through the door. The service is impeccable - someone greeted us immediately, and the timing throughout the evening was perfect. Our waiter, Guillaume, is clearly a pro who loves what he does, and we had a lovely nerdy conversation about crumbers and the logistics of importing wine.We went for the 2015 edition of Montréal à Table, which was a slightly reduced price for a three course meal including items already on their menu with one special exception - a mousse de foie de volaille that knocked our socks off. The smoky beets with root chips were also incredible and a surprise: I'm so used to every restaurant serving beets the same way, with goat cheese and acid, but these had an earthiness to them which gave them depth. The duck with risotto was very rich and we enjoyed it, but the Arctic char was a bit of a miss, lacking originality. That said, we probably wouldn't have chosen that particular dish had it not been one of the options for the evening's special.Dessert knocked our socks off, but we couldn't even finish it. Absolutely must try their Crémant de Jura if you like to start with a glass of bubbly - we loved it and may order a case of it thanks to our server's wealth of knowledge and advice! (Fellow Yelp-ers, feel free to contact me about ordering cases of crémant to share!)

Restaurant name  The Breadfruit & Rum Bar

Review Text :
Dear Breadfruit,  We became acquainted on the internet, like so many relationships these days do, and I must admit that I became fascinated with you quickly. Your menu sang to me with so many tasty words, and your location couldn't be better. We finally met last night, and I am disappointed. While you have a very cheery atmosphere and wonderful staff, your food just didn't woo me at all. The fish was overcooked- burned on the ends,even- and left me unsatisfied. The slaw looked promising, but proved to be nearly impossible to eat. (you try picking up long strings of cabbage and bean sprouts. Just see what happens.) And the breadstick? Oy. The taste of it was fantastic, but it was so overdone that I thought for a second that I might have to send you a dentist's bill if I finished it. My dining companion was enamored with your curry tofu. Sadly, the one bite of his tofu ended up being the highlight of my meal. Sigh. I wish that things had turned out better, Breadfruit, because I really wanted to like you. But, when visiting you leaves me hungry for the hole in the wall Caribbean place on Camelback and 35th Ave, I know that it just isn't going to work out. Good luck to you. PS...did a midget design your bathroom? I had no idea they even made sinks that small.Breadfruit is a cool spot. The interior of the place is well decorated and they can only seat about 15-20 people, making a nice, intimate ambiance. I really appreciate that they serve locally grown organic produce and that their chicken is all natural and raised cage free. Any addition of a Jamaican restaurant down town earns at least three stars in my book. We arrived at 7:30pm and were the only people there throughout almost the entire meal..We brought our own bottle of wine and there was only a $5 corking fee, not to shabby.We started with the plantain and avacado spring rolls, I really liked that wonton was baked and not deep fried, the presentation was nice, the mango chutney was fresh but the rolls themselves lacked flavor. I really wished they would have paired some other fruit or spice to add more contrast to the dish. For my main I got the jerk chicken and I was a little disappointed. Again they did an excellent job with the presentation, but the corn was mushy and what the jerk rub lacked in flavor they tried to make up for in spice.  I like spicy, and can handle a lot of heat, but heat shouldn't overpower flavor...The chef/owner came out and asked us how we enjoyed our meal, and explained his philosophy behind the food. The service was excellent, but in comparison to some other Jamaican places I've been, it really only warrants 3 stars (sorry)!I had the opportunity to visit Breadfruit in the company of a good group of friends who were all willing to share bites of the dishes they ordered. I brought a bottle of champagne to share and it seemed all of my friends brought bottles of liquid treasures themselves! We had so much to drink, that the champagne didn't get opened. With a reasonable corkage fee of 5$ it was easy to bring a ton of wine! For an appetizer we shared the plantain avocado spring rolls. They were so-so. Nothing overly impressive to me. I was actually wishing for a spicy sauce to dip them in. For my entree I had the Brown Stew Chicken dish. It's a marinated and sauteed chicken dish served with rice with peas and some steamed veggies. Again... no spice with the dish. I actually asked for some hot sauce to go with the dish. Despite the lack of heat, It was still very flavorful and I enjoyed it. I would like to give Breadfruit another try. I think their simple menu lends for getting a dish just right and making it well! I look forward to trying their other menu items!I don't intend to return, but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week, my "uncouth" self doesn't exactly feel welcome anyway. However, I'm not quite convinced that it's my loss... It had been almost a year since my original visit to Breadfruit which did not overwhelm (as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back) but I did have an appreciation of the option for Caribbean cuisine. Since a friend and I were going to be downtown for an event, I suggested Breadfruit for our dinner spot. We enjoy good food and supporting local. The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus, as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat! While the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly, 2 for $12.50 -- $6.25 per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book. We also shared the Jerk Chicken Salad ($9.95) and the Jerk Prawns Off the Grill ($14.95). Here's the ultimate rub, the bottom of the menu states "no substitutions or modifications"... Since when is cutting a KFC-side-sized ear of corn a "modification"? At the same time, the menu describes the restaurant and it's offerings as "Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body." It seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it -- particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate it's "beauty" AND after we've communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items -- is in the vein of "nothing fancy." How about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves, then? The fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the KFC-side-sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams "pretentious and grandiose" and tainted our entire experience. To quote my dinning companion, "You are not James Beard and James Beard would've cut the corn!""Rum makes a fine hot drink, a fine cold drink, and is not so bad from the neck of a bottle." So wrote Fortune Magazine in 1933, and it's nice to see we are starting to rediscover this spirit (after the demise of the Tiki scene). In fact, if you really want to motivate yourself to get out to Rum Bar, read "And A Bottle of Rum: A History of the New World in Ten Cocktails" by Wayne Curtis. I highly doubt you will make it through more than 2 chapters before you show up at Rum Bar wanting to try this fantastic spirit. Rum Bar is ideal for your venture into rum because soon they will have 108 rums to offer, ranging in price from $8 to over $120 a glass (with most between $8-15). On top of that, Rum Bar is offering unique and classic rum cocktails (which are going for $6 now, before going up to $8 plus per). We tried a handful of cocktails and each was well-made, even though the bar is still perfecting its recipes. The Estate Mai Tai is very good, and in no way hides the alcohol with overly sweet mixers like some Mai Tais...I consider that a good thing, some may not. The Dark and Stormy, properly made with Goslings, is good, but I think it could use some lime. The Mojito Vanilla is refreshing, without being overly sweet or filled with too much fake flavor. Another nice feature is that Rum Bar offers rum flights, a great way to try a range of rums. The food is right from the pass through to Breadfruit, so you can have some decent Jamaican food with your Rum. The service was very attentive, although a little to "salesy" for me, but then again, they are new and are trying to get their concept out to new customers. The space is small, cozy, and has just the right level of lighting for a drink of rum with your friends, pirates, your sugar supplier, or your copy of And A Bottle of Rum.I rarely go for Jamaican, as there are usually no vegan options except peas & rice.  I was lucky enough to find this place (via Yelp!)  when I was traveling for biz in PHX.  had an awesome lunch.  the menu clearly marks vegan options.  the tropical salad had a lovely tart dressing & the fresh pineapple was a nice touch. the sorrel drink was gingery hibiscus goodness!  but my entree took the cake:  an AMAZING coconut curried tofu.  it actually was seitan-- not tofu-- whatevs.simple, modern ambiance. super friendly & attentive waitstaff.will definitely go back if I make it to Phoenix again!01/27/11Yes, the mango fish rolls http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-breadfruit-phoenix-2?select=kKlpgD3Aa5BpVWDOnaufyg#kKlpgD3Aa5BpVWDOnaufyg were definitely crispy and tasted delicious, and yes, the oven-roasted plantains http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-breadfruit-phoenix-2?select=Q-JPbNWKKO0gMe66G9W2TA#Q-JPbNWKKO0gMe66G9W2TA were firm on the outside and just-like-buttah on the inside, but were they worth $10.50 and $5, plus tax, respectively?  I don't think so.  I took photos of the food w/ a pen next to the plates to show you how small these portions were.  Really, $12 for a small mango fish roll, sliced three-ways?  And I'm supposed to feel good about ordering an entree and dessert after?The Sweet potato pudd'n http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-breadfruit-phoenix-2?select=GhUFceoWCGwSCHxRw8ZMVA#GhUFceoWCGwSCHxRw8ZMVA was just absolutely fabulous, but you won't catch me driving all the way to The Breadfruit to spend my hard-earned money here.  At least I know they've reinvested some of the profits into remodeling the place... it looked fifty times better than when it did on its first year of opening.  If you wish to dine and converse w/ your companions, it's best not to come here on the weekends, when next door Rum Bar is hopping.  Then again, maybe it was just hopping on this night, bec. of the rum-tasting event held there...  I haven't been back since, so I don't know how busy these two businesses are.I can't really review the Rum Bar without reviewing Breadfruit.  They are really one in the same, and Breadfruit's food stole the day. But, to be honest, we have never physically be IN to Breadfruit.  We only go to the Rum Bar and we LOVE this place.  I have been there 3 times. Once when I was a sardine and packed into the place without room to even breathe, once with my parents in the comfy window seating are and once with my husband on a romantic date for 2.  I loved it every time...and by the third time, I was told by my husband "YOU HAVE TO YELP THIS PLACE NOW!" and he then exclaimed "I think this is my favorite food in the entire city."  My husband is not one to stake claim on anything less than spectacular (he is married to ME!)  so here I am giving them the highest rating and review I can muster...The drinks are extremely tasty, unique, clever and strong. I love the rums and the free tastings we have had of the various types of rum.  This place has really opened my mind and expanded my knowledge. I like that the bartenders and staff always ask our names and take an interest in what we are eating, drinking, talking about and liking about life.  They are so kind!But...and yes, there's a but...the Rum Bar experience won't be bringing us back.  It's the FOOD that is the big draw. What a great culinary experience. Every bite is a wonderful adventure. The spices, the mixture of fruits with the savory dishes, the fish...oh the fish!We plan on going back again...and again!  The location is a little tricky to find, but if you found SENS/Turf, it's in the same block (nearly the same building), but just around the corner. Don't despair, just walk south and take a left (east) and you'll see Breadfruit on the left.Wow. I really hated this place. Our server was also the bartender. (I ate there last night 1-30-12.) She was either terribly slow or terribly overworked. Either way-- not my problem. She came to the table and gave us a canned speech about "what she really likes on the menu." Of course, wow, everything she liked numbered amongst "most expensive" on the menu. Big surprise. (If you read other reviews on Yelp, you can read about the pushy service. Just awful.)She talked at us, and not to us. When we were done ordering, she-- in constant sales mode-- pushed the Rice & Peas, which is Jamaican rice and beans. I love rice & peas, so even though I didn't like our pushy server, I ordered anyway. When the food arrived, my companion and I each took a bite of the rice and-- if I would have had a napkin-- I would have spit it out. The flavor could only be described as "odd"-- and it was served room temperature. We both agreed- independently of one another-- that the rice was inedible. Gosh, the way our server upsold us, you would think it would be at least edible. I ordered the soup of the day. I was told it was red snapper with vegetable. It was a fish broth with vegetables. There was no red snapper. So why was "red snapper" included in the title of the soup? I have no idea. So they basically boiled some fish heads, put some veggies in, and made $7.25 profit on a $7.50 soup. I was pissed. Of course, I would have liked to tell our useless server / bartender about this, but she never stopped by to ask us how our meal was-- NOT ONCE. When the food was dropped, we ordered another round of drinks and did not get them until our meal was almost finished. The manager came and cleared our plates, so I told him. He just smiled and basically told me it was my fault for not enjoying the overpriced rice and soup. Plaintains were oven-roasted and tasty. Very stingy portion though.  I would say about half a plaintain per order. These people have their food cost in control baby! Don't serve any food! That's the key.The only thing that was good was my companion's jerk chicken. It was excellent, actually. As far as drinks go, the overpriced Mojito Vanilla was also good. So here's the deal: If you are a hipster foodie who likes the idea of eating overpriced Jamaican food-- even though you and your knit cap has never even been to Jamaica-- with stingy portions, and poor service...this is your place. They missed on every level. Horrible.Wow, wow, wow.  My hubby and I have been wanting to come to Breadfruit for a while.  My hubby has been to Jamaica and all over the Caribbean kiteboarding so he loves the cuisine.  We decided to have early dinner since the sitter came earlier this Saturday.  We didn't have a reservation, but that was no problem since we usually like to sit at the bar and talk to the bartenders.  Tony and Beth were so nice and efficient.  Tony just moved from Portland in  November, so we had a nice conversation with him about the area (we spend summers in OR). I had a mojito, wow, the best mojito I have had in the Valley, probably ever.  My hubby had the Caipirinha.  It was so good.  We thought we would have one appetizer and leave.  So we ordered the Scallops, then the Plantain and Avocado Spring Rolls.  They were so delicious.  The scallops were spicy, it was like fireworks in my mouth, in a good way.  I loved the sweetness of the chutney for my spring rolls.  My hubby wanted the soup of the day, the pumpkin and sweet potato soup.  I ended up eating most of it.  Since I was DD, the hubby had another drink, this time the Kingston Rum Punch, wow, that was strong but tasty.  Tony recommended the Rum Glazed Prawns and Roti Flatbread, double wow.  My hubby had a Pina Colada to wash that down. That was the best PC I've had.  Not the blended coco lopez type.   For dessert we had their bread pudding.  This was the only thing I was not that crazy about, don't get me wrong, I still ate it.  I am just used to the New Orleans type of Bread pudding, more gooey.  The experience at  Rum Bar was so great we can't wait to come back and bring friends.I haven't had many experiences in Jamaican dining but if this is what it always tastes like, then I think I'm adding Jamaican cuisine to my list of likes. Nestled on a side street in Downtown Phoenix, The Breadfruit could just as easily be nestled in a corner of a beach village just waiting for diners to experience an intimate meal. The vibe here is definitely like that of a beach town. Everything is calm, cool and collected. The dining room is tiny and if you plan on coming with more than just one person, I definitely suggest calling ahead. It's cozy, with dim lighting and perfect for a date night. Moving on to the food, those who can't handle a kick of spice to their cuisine should be warned! The menu doesn't lie when it says that the food is spicy. But if you can handle a major kick, the food is worth it. To start, I tried the mussels. I'm not typically a mussel fan but these were an exception. They had a Jamaican kick to them and the servings were generous in size. For my meal, I had the Jerk shrimp and holy moly did they have a jerk of spice to them! The shrimp came with pineapple and this long piece of plantain type bread and I ordered a side of rice. The meal was delicious. Now be warned, the pricing here isn't cheap, however I am not letting that take away from the fact that the food was delicious, the atmosphere was wonderful and the cocktails made of fresh fruit and delicious rum were supreme. I will definitely come back and this time I'll take a cab so I can continue my post dinner cocktailing at RumBar next door.The Breadfruit and Rumbar has been serving downtown Phoenix patrons tasty Jamaican food since 2008, but I finally checked it out for the first time this past weekend. I fell in love with it instantly and can't wait to go back.The Breadfruit and Rumbar is a charming Jamaican eatery with an extensive selection of more than 100 rums. I had one of my new favorite cocktails there, the changing-daily Punch Bowl Special ($9), made with fresh pomegranate and cranberry juices. It was so refreshing, plus pretty strong, and I could have sipped them all night long. And if you're into cigars, you can purchase one there to pair with your rum, too.We started with the Plantain Avocado Spring Rolls ($8.50), paired with a mango chutney. If you like the avocado rolls at Kona Grill, you'll definitely like these. And it's nice to know The Breadfruit locally sources all their menu items, so everything is extremely fresh.I'm usually not a huge tofu fan, but I took the recommendation of our server to order the Coconut Curry Tofu ($11.50). It was a really hearty, delicious dish, and the tofu reminded me of chicken bits -- I really liked it. The rice and beans (they're called "peas" on the menu) was my favorite part of the dish, which also came with veggies and plantains. It was a great variety of foods and really filling. I'd highly recommend it.My boyfriend got the Jerk Chicken ($12), which he said was the best jerk chicken he'd ever had.Besides the tasty food, the atmosphere at The Breadfruit was so pretty. The lounge area was dark and sophisticated -- you won't find any sports televisions -- and the main dining room was small and cozy. Service was excellent, and I'd recommend it as a great date place.There are very few places around downtown to have a drink and cigar, but this is one of them. Stocked by Churchill's cigars; a local cigar shop, Rum Bar has a reasonable selection of about eight or ten cigars and a bar full of rum and a mixologist to go with it. If you're into rum drinks this is also one of the best spots in town to get one.There are definitely a handful of shops in the area you can pick up a cigar, but none of them are open past 8 or 9 pm, and none of them will serve you a cocktail while you smoke. When I'm out with the pals and in the mood for a cigar, it's generally not before 8 pm. You've got to have a bit of forethought for that, and I'm rarely blamed for foreword thinking, that's for sure. Sure the drinks are premium priced, and the cigars too, but this is the spot when you're looking to pair them up.Note that smoking is only on their outdoor patio, and not in an inside lounge. It would be nice to find a spot with an inside smoking lounge in the downtown area, but beggars can't be choosers, right? :-/Happy Yelping Phoenix, see you around downtown!This isn't a "Jamaican spot". It's more like Fusion cuisine. And it's good for what it is, but it's not what I wanted. I just wanted a plate of Jamaican food, similar to what id get in a spot in Brooklyn.. This place is fancy, and they do a good job at that. They fit in well with what downtown phoenix is becoming. I got the scallops, it came with some spinach carrot mix. It was plated very well, presentation was A1.   Ambiance is very well executed. I think the prices are high, but then again I expected the type of Jamaican spot I'm used too, this place isn't that, but it is nice place to go out on a date. Somewhere where you would expect to pay about 40-45 dollars for dinner. I spent $13 plus tip for 2 scallops and a small veg medley and was still hungry.  In the future I'll find a hood Jamaican spot and get a full plate for $9this place is the pits. Also, you can't even order breadfruit at the breadfruit.I'm a huge fan of Jamaican food having a really good friend from the island that spoils me with authentic recipes that have passed down through generation in his family and traveling all over the world my palette is internationally known lol! Back to the story, needless to say my taste buds were going crazy with expectation! Well dannng, my girlfriend and I stood at the podium long enough to pull up Yelp and read several mixed reviews, since we had been noticed yet NO ONE was coming over to greet us we started toward the empty bar with one guy seated and a totally empty lounge area when we noticed the sign, "Please wait for server to be seared including the bar". So we waited and waited and waited until someone- anyone would make eye contact with us, finally a waitress approached us and asked if we have a reservation, I snickered like really, my girlfriend said no we do not and she stated it would be a wait haha okaaaay so we waited only shortly though. Once at the table we began browsing the drink menu in search of the Jamaican rum Wray&Nephew which they did so cool now as for the menu, we both noticed the absence of jerk wings hmm we thought maybe we'll ask our server. The server approached our table with a mouthful of the day's special selection and a great grasp of the menu, very impressive so we ordered Admiral's Punch and some starters: She had the Roasted Plantains with Chutney dip and I had the Baked Mango Fish Rolls. The plantains were soft not crisp and void of flavor as for my fish rolls they were pretty good but the fish was over cooked. The drinks were a bit weak until we added shots of Wray&Nephew. So as we sat sipping, a man stopped by our table and asked if we were enjoying our food, we looked at each other and she asked why jerk wings weren't served on the starter menu. The islander became very defensive explaining "his island eats the whole bird not just part of it", my girlfriend rebutted, having spent a lot of time in Jamaica feasting on local island cuisine as well as falling in love with the jerk wings! Wellll this stuck a nerve and to be quite honest I don't think he was expecting a real reply to his question just pretending to care. Needless to say, in life you meet some people that try so hard to upscale their image that they lose the true essence of their identity! Oh and he was rude because he kept wanting to rush off as if the place was packed lol! WARNING:  the only people that would be impressed by the food are those that have never truly experienced "real"Jamaican cuisine. And to think their "philosophy: Our philosophy is that good food should be good to eat...", my point exactly!In case you're wondering the one star was for having actual Jamaican rum!I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS PLACE!!! we arrived about 7 minutes earlier than our friends, and we waited about 15-20 min to be seated in an EMPTY place!First, we were "greeted" by a pretentious host, who tried so hard to make it seem as this place was the most chic and expensive restaurant in New York City! Haha NOPE!! We asked to be seated on the front patio since it was empty and it was super nice out. He quickly responded in a condescending way " No, patio is ONLY reserved for dining" "are you dining?" I was already over this place at this point.  Once the host decided enough time had passed he came and took us to the back patio, which is the smokers section... We were not smoking, we wanted to have a few drinks in a Non-smoking section... But I guess here you don't get the option. Anyway, it worked out after all since the place was empty. The host back here was nice and he did an ok job, but we asked to get a few drinks and an appetizer and we were told "We are not allowed to serve food back here" I was already over the pretentious attitude of this place and now I was over all the "Rules" they had.We order 4 drinks (all the same) and they only brought 3!  lol! I mean this place was EMPTY!! How can you forget 1 drink out of 4?! The drinks were Meh!, the pretentious service was Meh! And the tacky uncomfortable patio set was Meh! This could be an amazing place if they would only stop pretending this is fine dining, get rid of your host upfront and all your rules. Focus on making people comfortable and welcomed so they want to come back!I will NEVER BE BACK HERE AGAIN! so please don't waste your precious time and money. We drank our meh! Drinks payed our bill and took our party to Bliss Rebar, now this place was amazing. Drinks were great, food is great and the service is frendly and welcoming! Boom!! That's what you want as a review!

with a handwritten menu, this place has all the charm and bustle of a real french bistro.be sure to be adventurous and try out their specialities.my father and i enjoyed the following at lunch:1. the roasted bone marrow - topped with a delicate lettuce leaf, each selected bone was a different height.  2. the mustard celery was fantastic!!!! thinly sliced and "pickled" with mustard, i devoured this right up.3. the veal kidneys with mushroom and house potatoes were excellent!  rich and filling.  this is a must try.4. the veal liver with perfect fries and homemade mayo is not for the faint of heart.  this was quite a generous portion.  it would be something that i normally would not try but now, i would order it in a second.  the dish was packed full of flavor!for dessert, we enjoyed a giant but light serving of the floating island - a lovely confection of whipped eggwhites with a sugar caramel crust topped with almond slices and floating on a sea of english cream.  it was the best one that i have ever sampled even compared to all the restos in paris.fast and friendly service, this is a definite stop for anyone - local or just visiting.  be sure to look around as you may spot a local celebrity or two.Excellent food, wine and service. The bartender was extremely knowledgeable and gave great recommendations along the way on food and pairings. They encouraged us to take our time and order each course as we were ready for the next.

Cute...there's really no other word that covers what you see when you walk in to the Ranch House Grill:)There's gingham, lariats, spurs, split rails, barbed wire, saddles and all kinds of "ranchy" things in the décor.The décor is basically what my mother probably wanted to accomplish with the ranch house that I grew up in (and maybe could have, if she'd figured out how cover up the 40 year old wall paper, the dead white linoleum floors, and hot pink appliances and kitchen sink:(But enough about me:)The menu here is basic, but well executed, and what more can you ask from a place that bills itself as country cookin'?...Not much in my book:)This is the second RHG location (the first is in Page, on the way to Colorado City, I guess so you can fuel up with big food, so you have enough energy to "visit" all your wives:)This RHG location brings that small town, big food, restaurant feel to SE Phoenix:)Lunching with some buddies the other day...we decided to give RHG a test drive...none of us had been there before (in fact, I think lots people haven't been here...and they should be going to RHG:)Walked in at noon, had our drinks almost before we asked (I said "almost before"...to say we had them any sooner would imply a temporal causality paradox that I don't want to deal with here...email me if you want the math:)The menu is "robust"...not much in the "amuse bouche" section, but plenty of "steak and eggs" options.I selected Chicken Fried Steak with double mashed potatoes...and gravy...incredible, delectable gravy!:)RHG has a sign outside that says they have been voted "Best Chicken Fried Steak" in Phoenix, by somebody...I'm adding my vote to the total:)...It was outstanding...hand pounded round steak, sausage gravy, buttery mashed potatoes and thick toast...I haven't had CFS this good since the last time I was in Waco.My luncheon companions had, respectively, a Patty Melt (which he said was as good as any he'd ever had...hyperbole?...sure, but he's an attorney and given to hyperbole:), and a Chili and Cheese Omelet (BTW, I'm going back just for their chili...two kinds...red beef and green pork...both homemade and both crazy good:)The platters (that's right, I said "platters") of food arrived and we spent the next half hour wading through the food...more than plenty to eat!...a ranchers lunch in the truest sense of the word...enough food to keep you going through a long afternoon of building barb wire fence, bucking hay, herding recalcitrant bovines and mucking out the feed barn...none of which I have done since I was 15 years old...thank god!:)It also helps, even if you're just pounding out emails and answering phones:)Every so often, you need a lunch like this one...Mark Knopfler said it best..."if you want to run cool, you have to run on heavy, heavy fuel":)http://tinyurl.com/y8nw3dsThe bill came to about $10 apiece and the service was 25% tip range service:)I think RHG fits the description of "hidden gem":)...It is a gem and you really have to look for it to find it:)It will help if you look at the intersection of Thomas and 56th Street:)I'm dropping Ranch House Grill into the diner category, and in that category they rate a nice 3 stars.The service was prompt and friendly, the prices were fair and the food was pretty good.The huevos rancheros with roasted pork green chili was very tasty.  I would probably get that again if I were dining at Ranch House Grill again.The diced green chili and cheese omelet was less impressive.  The green chili in the omelet didn't have alot of flavor and the omelet itself needed more cheese.  The shredded potatoes were nice and buttery but I like them with some crispiness, at least on the top and bottom.  These were a bit soggy but still good.  They just needed another minute on the grill.

Town Square is the place to be for happy hour!  With so many choices - Brio Tuscan Grille is a great place to get your grub on for cheap!Their Tuscan Taster Menu is available in the bar area only and runsMonday through Friday: 3 pm to 6 pmSunday through Thursday: 9 pm to closeAll nine of their mouthwatering items are only $2.95!!  What a steal!* Braised Meatballs & Creamy Polenta "Topped with Marsala tomato sauce, Reggiano and parsley." - Three generous sized meatballs in a tasty and tangy sauce.  The polenta is a minimal amount the covers the bottom of the dish, but a nice touch.  The Husband really enjoyed this and was about to get another!* Beef Carpaccio "Served with field greens, capers, mustard aioli and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese." - Our favorite of the ones we tried, so we got two orders.  So good and tasty, and the field greens are a nice complement to the dish.* Margherita Flatbread "Fresh Mozzarella, vine-ripened tomatoes and fresh basil." - Very basic flatbread pizza, no fancy frills here.  A nice simple crunch.* Sliced Steak Bruschetta "With Gorgonzola Dolce, arugula, fennel, charred tomato, shaved Parmesan and Tuscan Italian dressing." - Four slices of bruschetta makes this a hearty dish with the cheese and beef.  Good flavors though and sauce adds a nice sweetness.Unfortunately, their happy hour only extends to the food so there are no drink specials.  (When I called, whomever answered said there were drink specials but it wasn't so when we sat down.)  The bartenders took our food and drink orders, and the food came out promptly.  We had no issues with service as a result unlike the other reviewers.Overall, it's a nice place and we enjoyed ourselves here.  The dining room looks like a grand hall with all the drapery.  I suggest getting your grub on here and getting drunk somewhere else if you want to save a few bucks.Update! 07/15/09 - Went back again last Friday and finished off the entire Tuscan Tasters menu.* Brio Burger "A quartet of BRIO's famous Bistecca Burgers, with smoked Mozzarella and housemade chips." - A very decent size burger for three bucks that was tasty and cut into four, perfect for sharing.  Chips were yummy too!* Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant "Grilled shrimp with Romano crusted eggplant and a black pepper cream sauce." - A surprise goodie!  Came with eight shrimp/eggplant stacks and definitely would definitely order again.* Sausage & Pepperoni Flatbread "Fresh Mozzarella and housemade tomato sauce." - Good pizza where they aren't shy about the toppings.* Shrimptini "Chilled shrimp served in a martini glass with roasted tomato cocktail sauce and fresh lemon."  Uneventful of the bunch, fine for simple shrimp but lacks any excitement.* Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta "With fresh basil and balsamic drizzle." - Tasty bread bites with four pieces of bruschetta.This time we went with a group of four and ordered one of everything.  It pretty much filled us for the most part, although if you're hungry, just double up on the burgers and meatballs.  We grabbed a little table this time in the bar area inside and our waitress was fine again.  It took a bit of time to get the table cleared and for the orders to go in, but nothing to complain about.  Overall, they did well again for filling our tummies on a budget!When I hit up Vegas I don't usually hit up restaurants.  I know some of you are probably thinking... Why not?  Don't they have tons of great restaurants out in the City of Gluttony?   True that... But!  Remember!  This is also home to endless scrumptious buffets as well!  How can I let that slide right?  Ok... so I ended up at a restaurant this time around... Buffets I'll see you on my next trip.Stopped by this hidden shopping plaza near the South end of the strip... Yes!  There is one real nice shopping mall and it's not an outlet!  (Town Square)  This plaza is totally nice and especially during the winter time coz it's got such a cozy feel to it... since we were looking for food, we came, we searched, and we landed at Brio Tuscan Grille.Initially I thought I wasn't going to like it, but I'm glad that I was wrong.  Let me tell you why this is definitely a place that I'd go back again...Décor:  Awesome!  Interior design at this place rivals those at the Grand Lux café except much fancier!  Dim, beautiful lighting, and awesome outdoor patio with a fire pit for a nice little gathering should you have a large party.Food was actually more tastier than I was expecting...  Here were just the few that I've sampled-Calamari:  Flash fried to perfection with aioli dipping sauce, yum!-Penne Gorgonzola:   Off the hook good with just the right amount of sauce-Fettuccine Rustica:  Just ok... not enough sauce for my taste-Chipotle Chicken and Bacon Panini:  One of the best sandwiches I've had!  The bread was toasted beyond perfection to a point that it is crispy yet chewy!!! Not sure how that happened but I really need to try more paninis and see if they all taste this good!  Then the chipotle flavor coupled with load of chicken was just awesome!  (Yes, this was my dish!)Service was wonderful too!  Water was always filled to the rim without requesting them to come by to do so, and they also allow dogs to be right by the gate so our buddies can share some food with us!  (not inside but at least near us)Price:  Very reasonable!  Majority of the dishes for lunch runs no more than $15 and good portions too!If you are in the Sin City and craving Italian, do help your wallet a favor by giving this place a visit instead of some fancy Italian joint inside the casino... you won't regret it!One of my best dining experiences ever!!!!What could be better than a pleasant and romantic Las Vegas night with your BF in a place with world class service, ambience and food? I am not exaggerating! You heard it - world class! I simply did not expect this at all - it was that great!From the moment we walked around the beautiful exterior of the restaurant and sat in the waiting area and got to see the gorgeous interior of the restaurant I had a great feeling the experience would be great - but it actually excelled that expectation!We were seated quickly even though we were told we would wait a bit longer. I could not help but look at the pretty earth toned surroundings while my BF and I chatted away. I had read that the risotto was great here so I looked for it on the menu but could not find it. Well, the waiter overheard that I was looking for the risotto and he said that he would see if they could make it for me anyway. WOW!!!! Double WOW actually, because he came back soon and said that they would make it for me! The bread basket here is just great! They kept it coming too! They serve a thin crisp bread which is just divine!Their iced tea is great and it kept coming too! We never had to ask for anything. The waiter was always looking to make our meal just perfect! You should have seen us drink it too! The hot desert night made us so thirsty!My shrimp risotto with red pepper was a dream of a dish! The rice was just right and the creamy sauce was ever so tasty! The shrimp were fresh and cooked to perfection! I am not a big fan of any kind of pepper but they integrated the pepper into the dish ever so subtly and created just the right level of spiciness! It is like they read my mind! OMG!!!!My BF had grilled shrimp, steak and chicken. It was soooo tender and juicy that I just wanted to cry tears of the utmost food ecstasy! It all had a really nice grilled taste to it too!This place was recommended to us by a good friend of my BF and he really impressed me with his taste on this one! Thanks Pedro!Parking is no issue since Brio Tuscan Grille is located in a large mall. There is outdoor seating as well. Great for people watching! Let no one fool you - this is no average Italian restaurant!Brio is one of our loves and the place we like to go for birthday dinners, family get togethers. It's very pretty inside and the beautiful decor reflects the good food.They have a full bar and happy hour and a wonderful outdoor seating area where you can people watch while enjoying your meal.I have a great affinity for the flatbread that comes in their bread basket. Crispy triangles that are coated in herbs, sesame seeds, and cheese full of flavor and texture.Our favorite is the Pasta alla Vodka. That is why we come to Brio.My heart skips a little beat when they put this dish down in front of me and shower it in finely grated parmesan cheese. The aroma of the vodka sauce is one I have not experiened in any other Italian restaurant. Can't quite put my finger on what makes that distinctive delicious Brio Vodka sauce so special. Maybe it's the garlic that's been shaved thin (with razor blades?), or the fresh basil that perfumes the sauce, or it's the star of the dish...the soft pillows of heaven...the delicate ricotta filled pasta purses that melt in your mouth and go oh so very well with the sauce. I swear someone else must be eating my dish because it goes too quick until you devour the last of the pasta and reach for the sourdough bread to sop up the rest of this amazing sauce...it would be a sin not to!This is all I want to write about Brio, because when you come there you must order the Pasta Alla Vodka :)So glad we ended up here last night!We started off at Texas De Brazil but the wait was over and hour and a half! Then we tried Tommy Bahamas and they were closed for a private event!Finally we happened upon Brio and their wait was over an hour!We slipped into the bar and as fate would have it a table was getting up to leave right as we walked in!! So we swooped the table like the stealthy women we are and all was right with the world.We had an amazing server! We had a few drinks and I have to say their Raspberry Mojito is a must try!We started with the Carpaccio appetizer and it was absolutely heavenly. Like I'm crazing it right now at 8:00AM just writing about it good.For our main course we had the Steak salad and the Salmon salad. Both were ginormous portions and incredibly tasty. Neither of us were able to finish them and we left incredibly satisfied!This will definitely be a go to for girls night!Oh sweet, sweet Brio.  I absolutely love this place.  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  Yes, it's a chain, but I definitely give props to a restaurant chain that makes food as delicious as Brio.  There are no negatives or neutrals about this place.+ Wonderful service.  Our waitress was so nice.  She helped me make a decision on my meal and she was very knowledgeable of the menu.  Also, the other employees were happy and spunky.+ You can add or modify your meal as needed.  A lot of big restaurants (especially more expensive ones) don't allow you do personalize your meal.+ FOOD.  Oh my goodness.  If you want a meal that is flavorful, cooked right, and unique, you have to try this place.  I ordered the Mushroom Ravioli and it was the best meal I've ever had.  I could taste the different cheeses, the pasta was cooked perfectly, and it melted in my mouth.  My mom ordered a chicken dish and it came with two large chicken breasts and vegetables (she substituted rice for veggies).  Of course, I'm vegetarian and can't eat meat, but the veggies were ridiculous!! They were so delicious.+ Prices and portions.  Yes, the prices are a tad high, but the portions make it worth it.  I had ten large raviolis stuffed well with mushrooms.  It could easily be split into two meals.+ Creme brulee.  They have about eight different kinds of creme brulee to choose from.  I ordered the chocolate cake, the original and caramel.  Fantabulous.  Spectacular.  Even if you don't eat a meal here, you MUST try their desserts!!  It will be the best thing you ever do for yourself.I had wanted to try the happy hour here but just missed it (ends at 6) and decided to stay and try out dinner. They have a nice big patio along a not too busy street. This is a nice place to come on a date in this area. I asked if they made any of their pastas in house and the only one that I was told was made fresh was the fettuccine so I substituted it in the garganelli carbonara dish. It was yummy. A good balance of pasta, sauce, chicken and spinach. I usually never have enough chicken for the pasta, but I actually had chicken and not pasta left. My boyfriend had the lasagna. I took one bite and thought it was really good. He said it had some hard chunks of tomato that he wasn't too fond of. We asked for more bread, which never came because it was frozen or something. We were told it was delayed, but it never came. We had the vanilla bean creme brulee and caramel creme brulee. It was served in these small tea cups which were the perfect size for an after dinner treat. The caramel was my favorite and they were only $2.45 each. I didn't try the bruschetta, but it looked delicious and I will definitely come back to try it. Please bring your patience. It took over an hour and a half to have dinner here and all we had were our pasta dishes and dessert (no appetizer or salads).9/18Checked out their happy hour- select apps $2.95 each!  However, no specials on the alcoholic beverages, with a quick glance at the wines-by-the-glass revealing prices of about $9 and up.  Thank goodness Total Wine and More was holding its grand opening (w/ a penny wine-tasting!) that day... Violeta and I decided to try a few apps here and then head straight to Total Wine for the liquid component :)I should make a correction to the last statement above- it was I that tried a few apps- the Sliced steak brushetta and the Brio brushetta quattro," while Violeta H. tried the Margherita flatbread.  My apps were both outstanding!  I could probably be satisfied w/ two orders of the steak brushetta (loved that Tuscan Italian dressing!), while an order of the brushetta quattro would suffice (it's their burger, quartered, and a side of homemade potato chips).  While I had my hands full w/ the two apps AND their great sourdough table bread (there were also some great-looking seeded crackers/flatbread, too, but I couldn't try it due to food allergies), Violeta confided that she loved her Margherita flatbread.  Brio Tuscan Grille's happy hour, despite the lack of discounted beverages, provides impressive hors d'oeuvres at exceptional value.  I'll definitely visit again =)We've gone to Brio a couple of times now and have been pleased. This most recent time, I went with my mom & bf and really enjoyed our experience. Our waitress came by after we were seated and took our drink orders immediately. She was great in coming by the entire night to check on us if we needed anything, got us drink refills, etc.For food, my bf really wanted some eggplant. Although there's no entree with eggplant on the menu, our waitress said that the kitchen would be able to make eggplant parmesan. Exactly what he was looking for! Me and my mom shared the Pasta Brio with chicken. I snagged a bite of the eggplant and thought it was cooked well, the breading wasn't too thick & it was really flavorful. Only thing lacking was maybe a bit of the pasta sauce since there was quite a bit of pasta that came with the dish. The Pasta Brio was cooked al dente and even though the split portion looked small, it was actually very filling. My mom doesn't like mushrooms so I got all of them, which made me realize that there were actually more than I thought/expected! They didn't skimp on those nor the portion of chicken.The prices of the entrees are a bit on the high side, however I think for the quality of food, I can still justify giving them a solid 4 stars. We'd recommend this restaurant to others.

Restaurant name  Primanti Brothers at PNC Park

Review Text :
***The good thing about the concessions at PNC Park is that they feature local brands/products like Primanti Brothers; the bad thing (and definitely not surprising) is that the ballpark version of Primanti Brothers is probably not a good representation of their food***I have never been to an actual Primanti Brothers location, but I've heard of it.  This Primanti Brothers location is inside PNC Park and it features a limited menu (a few sandwiches and their fries).  The sandwiches are served on thick bread and topped with French fries.I ordered some of their French fries as a side.  They were freshly cut, but the fries had been sitting around for a while.  Some of the fries were crisp, but most of them were limp, soggy and cold (they were also quite greasy).  With the skin on and everything, the fries might capture the great and guilty pleasure experience of carnival fries when they are served just out of the fryer.  But given that the fries are so unevenly cut here, you still may not get consistently great fries with one order (even when they are hot and fresh).Cheese dip is also available for an extra charge.  The cheese dip was the standard cheese dip you get with stadium nachos.The fries were expensive, but I did purchase them at a ballpark and the portion size was generous.Service was fine and quick.Since ballpark food often sits around (I had a similar experience with garlic fries at AT&T Park in San Francisco), PNC Park is probably not the best location to try Primanti Brothers.  The fact that Primanti Brothers is a local product might make you consider giving it a try over other generic concession food at PNC Park.  That being said, PNC Park seems to feature a lot of local food so you may want to explore the park a little before committing to Primanti Brothers (or at the very least, you should request the staff to serve you a fresh batch of food).Primanti Brothers is located within the stadium so it is only for ticket owners.  There are several parking lots and structures nearby.  The lot right next to PNC Park is $25, but a structure just one block over is only $15.

some gouddda pizzzza, though expectations were high so ehh.ingredients are fresh, kept simple. all about minimalism. classic thin crust dough. twas good, but didn't blow me away. although I've never been one for thin pizzas (unless it is Ian's..they do their crust so right: crispy, yet doughy, so good). dough here was a bit on the gummy side?? if that's a thing. we tried:pizza bianca - olive oil, basil, garlic, fresh mozzarellapizza rossoverde - basil, prosciutto, parmesan, arugula, mozzarellacustomized pizza of mozzarella, parmesan, fennel sausagealso ordered the caprese salad - tomatoes, basil, housemade fresh mozzarella, olive oil, sea salt^^delicious.not sure which pizza was my favorite. all were pretty aight flavor wise. their pizzas are on the smaller size, so if you are starving, you should order six of them and you could probably polish them off just fine..*exaggeration*I'll be back to see if they can't impress me more next time.

Pretty tasty sweet corn tamales and huge margaritas....raspberry flavor to boot. Service was okay, but the chips and salsa were spot on, just like Chevys...yep almost my favorite. Small, inside location, quite accommodating.Best part...didn't have to pay. Me likey.The food was good. They make the guacamole table side and give you the option to not include any of the ingredients. I heard the flautas were amazing, but didn't try them. I got the barbecued salmon with mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus. Salmon with 2 of my favorite side dishes are hard to beat. Perfect amount of food too. Enough to create a nice base for drinking all night, but not too much that you feel bad leaving most of it behind. I felt the specialty drinks were a touch too sweet, but you could tell they were made well. Also our server was incredibly nice and not just split up the tab for us but also split the shared items so we were charged a fraction of each.After finding out it would be a 2 hour wait at Gordon Ramday BurGR, we decided to hang out inside YOLOS (they had no wait) for drinks and appetizers. I was first impressed by the large, long booth we were sat at. That quickly changed when the people at our table kept kicking each other. There was no room under the table for us to sit comfortably. Our server was quick to take our drink order and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. We ordered a "Quesadilla" priced at $10 and "Empanadas" priced at $10 for our snackage. The quesadilla had jack cheese, onions and peppers inside. It also came with a side of salsa, sour cream and guacamole. The quesadilla was good, but average. If you want beef, chicken or shrimp in it then it will cost you $4-$5 more. The empanadas were well liked by hubby and I. They were stuffed with chorizo and had a green chile avocado salsa underneath them. The only complaint I have about that dish is the size of it. They put enough of the green chile avocado salsa on the plate so why not add just 1 more empanada to make it an even 4? If this were a cocktail party I could understand the small bites and portions, but this wasn't the case. With 4 people at our table it was awkward so hubby and I just ended up splitting one of them. The margarita did taste decent! They have lunch specials during the week that right now start at $9.95 and a Happy Hour at the bar as well. Also beware about the music inside this place. it's very loud and it's hard to have a conversation with the people sitting right at your table.Stopped in here to hang with some friends and most likely won't be back. The music is way to damn loud. Seriously you can't hear the person sitting right next to you let alone sitting across from you. The booths are so cramped together that you play a game of "kicking footsie" with others at your table. My wife accidentally got kicked from the person sitting across from her and she was bleeding. Like missing a toenail bleeding. The food tasted decent however you don't get enough for the cost and it certainly isn't authentic Mexican food.

BESTEST CREPES. ME LIKEY.I've experienced quite a few...multiple times...These guys have mastered the Art of Crepe. Yes. It's a thing. Spot-on thickness. Splendid texture, akin to the dense-quality of a good pancake, yet not so doughy. Plus they've got an oh-so-delicate sweetness that allows for versatility as far as making these beauties sweet or savory.  *Dark chocolate, caramel, sea salt crepe - FAN-frickin-TASTIC. My most-ordered crepe from here. The one that I dream about at night. I no lie. *Pumpkin mascarpone pecan crepe - SEASONAL, sigh. *Lemon curd and whipped cream crepe - in the words of my dear, econ-majoring friend: "THE TANGENCY!" (for the mathaphobes out there - this is code for: she loved it)*Apples and caramel and pecan crepe - one of their greatest. (certainly on par with the dark chocolate one I crave every waking moment of my life) the sugary deliciousness of the caramel...with the sweet crunch from the apples and the indulgent flavor of the pecans - love.*Smoked prosciutto spinach parmesan scrambled - this is the one savory crepe I've dabbled into, though this was my friend's order so I only took a few bites. Tasty nonetheless. As far as beverages: I've had their peppermint tea. Check mate. And their chai latte can't be beat. The Art of Crepe carries over to the Art of Latte/latte art - they've got this down man. Delicious AND beautiful bevvies. Basically, I love you Bradbury. One of my favorite spots - to study/chill/gastronomically indulge - in Madison.I love Bradbury's. I live a block away and head here just about every weekend. Their crepes are really tasty and their coffee is great, too. I also appreciate that they have fast wifi and even though it can get a little tight (it's a small place), I've never not been able to find a seat. Plus, the big windows make it the perfect place to absorb a sunny morning and do some people-watching.

Review Text :
I had Patati Patata on my list of "must try" places in Montreal and I STILL managed to walk right past it earlier in the day without noticing it.  Patati Patata is super small (I can't imagine it seating more than 15 people) and unobtrusive, but it is fantastic.  You can opt to sit at the counter or one of three or four tables.  I wouldn't recommend this place for parties of more than two - you're going to have a very  hard time finding some configuration so you can sit together.  I saw lots of people getting takeout from the counter (fill your order in on little slips of paper, hand it over, wait briefly, receive cheap delicious food, hand over coins rather than bills (oh, Canada!), and go).Patati Patata served up the best poutine I had in Montreal (though granted, I only had it twice) with onions and green peppers for $4.  Amazing.  Even MORE amazing, 10 oz. beers were $2.50.  Even with the waning exchange rate advantage, that's awesome!  The staff is a little brusque (they're super busy) but also nice.  One of the counter guys offered the girls behind me free beer because he had to change the taps.  They were drinking the red, and I had the blonde so I got no free beer.  Drat.I will say Patati Patata is not a place to linger.  There was a line out the door on the Thursday evening I went (it seemed to be mostly university students) so I finished as quickly as I could. Before I was even to the register, my seat had been snatched, but I think that's more a testament to how good this place is than anything else.I came here in Summer 2013 (twice) and I loved it!  Their prices are very reasonable and I ordered take out twice because I didn't want to wait for a table.  The restaurant is very small and can only seat up to around 15 people I believe.The burgers are very cheap (I believe around two bucks) so ordering two will fill you up easily.  Their fish burger is also very tasty and their poutine is decent.  The walk from central Montreal is perhaps 15-25 minutes so I feel like it's worth it since there is a lot to see on the way to this restaurant.The restaurant is actually pretty hard to spot because the name is kind of hidden so you might want to look it up on google images to prepare yourself. (or just use GPS on your phone if you have data)  Patati Patata is the epitome of the term  "cheap eats" and definitely should be visited by anybody, not only people on a budget!

Review Text :
So we were wondering about the Korean options in Charlotte - or lack thereof - and finally Yelp-searched the situation.  The only real contender according to our search was Cho Won.  So we checked it out one recent Saturday for lunch.Disclaimer: we went after "slaying" a workout session at the gym, and since exercise = hunger, and hunger = the best sauce, it could be that our ravenous appetites would have made any meal seem like a sumptuous feast.Anyway, we got our menus and realized that this place is pretty expensive.  A lot of the entrees and BBQ options were up in the $20-30 range.  Even a lot of the appetizers were over $10.  We were all "WTF?"  Then we took chill pills and decided to order the cheapest thing on the menu, bibimbap.  Actually, that's what I wanted in the first place.  The bibimbap was $10, or $13 for the hot stone bowl version that makes the rice all crispy.  We both got the former.  At $10, it was a little high compared to Korean joints in Chicago or NYC, but only by a couple bucks.But we got our money's worth.  The bibimbap was as good as any I've had, but we also got the full-on Korean BBQ side dish treatment: seven or eight sides plus a bowl of soup came with the bibimbap, and the waiter asked repeatedly if we wanted more (refills on the sides were free).Everything was super fresh, super tasty, spiced well, just awesome.They've got some good lunch specials if you can make it out there on a weekday.Can't wait to go back on a special occasion and splurge on the non-bibimbap options.

Review Text :
We visited our friends in Goodyear and I was kind of psyched to revisit Taste of Italy 2 where we had pizza the last time. Our local friends wanted to take us to Grimaldi's instead, their favorite pizzeria about 20 minutes away. Being the Yelpcurious sort, I was game to try this much hyped place. The downside to a place that has been hyped is that one's expectations are higher. We ordered:* Mediterranean Salad - Tasted fresh and good, but the dressing wasn't very balanced. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=ARQro-dR-8Hd90yb1yUyAQ* Pizza half plain cheese, half with basil and tomatoes http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=SbHD7fVvL32LgaUIpCBq9Q* Pizza with sausage, pepperoni, and basil http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=wl7YMUaOquTxdYgR4SG6Hg* Louis Martini Cabernet - for our friend* Red Sangria - for our friendPositives:+ I'm all about the thin crust. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=qf12YBWeKcLe2leFp09fPA+ The sauce has a nice kick to it.+ The fresh mozzarella tasted good. In fact, everything was very fresh.+ They give kids pizza dough to play with while waiting for the food - fun! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=9ZRm5qrrVJIQDnohj1llDANegatives:- There was a 45 minute wait - the price of popularity.- The service had chain feel to it that didn't rub me the right way. "I'm (server's name), and I'm going to take care of you." It was friendly enough, but wasn't for me.- My friend's pizza didn't have enough basil, and she asked for more. Our server said she could bring more for $2. That was disappointing for a tiny dish of chopped basil, considering it was already a topping and our $75 bill.Overall, I enjoyed the pizza and the kid-friendly atmosphere. It wasn't the best ever, but I'm a fan.3.5 stars!  After doing some light shopping in the Park West area, my friend and I stopped into Grimaldi's Pizzeria for a quick bite.The coal-brick oven was a pretty enticing feature and my friend and I ordered two personal pizzas.  The crust was thin, crispy, and had a good amount of char.  The tomato sauce also had decent flavor.  What I didn't enjoy was paying for each topping I wanted.  It can go from a $10 pizza up to a $20 pizza easily... and this is for a small 12" pie!  We passed up on dessert and just headed over to the chocolate shop across the way. Grimaldi's is a cute little restaurant with lots to offer.  It's a tasty pie but for the price, I rather eat elsewhere.I have been the original Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge & the location in NYC and I have to say...  Eating at the Peoria location brings me back to my NY trips!  Of course, without the heavy winter coat, shaking in the cold, and wind in my face while waiting for 45 mins for a table for two.  I am here in AZ, in flipflops and enjoying the weather while waiting outside on the bench!  :)  The service was great (no asking for refills).  He checked on us a few times.  I had the white pizza with chicken and bacon...  YUM!  I am still in love with the regular red sauce.  Guess I need to go back soon!Grimaldis is a nice pizza restaurant with amazing thin crust pizza. The pizza is thin, but not too thin where it's crunchy. They also have a variety of salads most standard. It's a very simple yet good menu. The New York cheesecake does not disappoint either. It's so rich and creamy and not overly sweet just perfect. The waitress was great also and made us feel right at home. Only reason for the 4 stars is it's very pricey. If you come here you will pay top dollar for these great pizzas. It's a must try!

I can't find a better Mexican grill anywhere. I'm addicted to their pastor, asada, and quesadillas. Their service has improved, so it's only a few minutes for my meal on even the most crowded days. And the prices are modest for the quality of your meal. Next time you're in the west valley and want Mexican, come HERE. If you had another place in mind, I doubt it's as good!This place is without question my favorite Taco Shop in AZ !!!! Period!!I had no idea what I was missing until I was brought to this wonderful establishment by a friend of mine.So here's how it works, they grill up the meat and tortillas on a Mequite Fired Grille. You will not believe what kind of flavor it adds to the meat. They offer the standard Carne Asada for the White Boys, but I would stay away. It is far too simple.If you want to experience some real flavor, go for the Barbacoa, Lengua, Al Pastor, or Tripas. The Tripas are deep fried and so damn flavorful.They have a ridiculous salsa bar, with amazing salsa's, but you have to ask for the Habanero which they keep behind the bar. They also have fresh cabbage, onions, limes, and peppers with carrots at the salsa bar.All I can say, is you have to experience the simplicity and mesh of natural flavors. The true experience and blend of flavors is truly indescribable.The place is clean, super authentic, and always full, even in the morning hours.it is a straight up Mexican Joint, so learn some damn Spanish and be respectful!This place is so worth the drive, I now go there at least once a week! I'm craving this place just writing about it.Trust me on this place, and write a more descriptive review and tell me how right I was by recommending this place. I swear that they put something in the meat to get people addicted, it's that good!Salute! =)Ok...so I know I have said this before, but this is legit.  These are the best tacos in the valley...perhaps anywhere! It wouldn't have even happened had Fajardo's Cafe been open! We had driven out to Glendale and it was closed, so I jumped on Yelp and this place came up!  It's a very small place and if I hadn't read Floyd C's review, I probably wouldn't have found it! (Thanks, Floyd!!!)  It is on the north east corner of 59th Ave and Camelback.  However, it is facing 59th avenue...yeah.  we drove around a few times...then read the review! Oh....gotta love random adventures leading to a diamond in the rough!You go up to the counter, order...and they hand you a little plate to fill with all of the fixings they have at the salsa bar...which to be honest...they're all AMAZING!!!!  Plus, they have cucumbers, lettuce, onion/cilantro mix, carrots and limes! LIMES!! Remember...I have a lime fetish.  ***the ONLY complaint I have...and it is not even that big of a deal and I won't be taking any stars away is that they don't have cilantro alone...I hate raw onions. Like to the point of having a close to "ick" reaction! *** Anywhoooo...I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and a lengua taco with a side of beans.The lengua (tongue...yes tongue) is absolutely flavorful and SOOOOOOOOO tender!  The carne asada is probably the most flavorful I have ever had here in the valley!  The beans are amazing and super yummy...it seems to me that they have chorizo and cheese in them.  The service is quick and not so personable, but not rude at all! They are busy and are pretty much just making sure to get everyone their orders!  We will be back! Every Tuesday! ;-)Wanna know how much we enjoyed our meal?  We each ordered a carne asada burrito to go...for lunch tomorrow!  We never do that!  So who is up for Taco Wednesday? Thursday? Any day that ends in "Y"??

If you are Vietnamese or appreciate Vietnamese food, and are looking for Bo Bay Mon (7 Courses of Beef), this is the best place in the Montreal Metro area to get it. It may not be as good as Westminster's Little Saigon or San Jose, but for Montreal, it is the best. This on recommendation of the Vietnamese locals.If you like Beef and Vietnamese food, this is the choice for you. If you have never had this 7 course meal wich is becoming very popular on the West Coast of the US, check it out, or bring  a Viet friend to show you the ropes on how to eat each course.

Ok so really I know my tapas. I've been to Spain and spent hours in a tapas bar drinking wine eating great food and enjoying great conversation. This comes real close to the tastes. I came here with a small group with intentions to see what Chef Errol was all about. I was very impressed with the fact he was using Food Science which is the new cutting edge trends hitting up many spots in LA and NY.The ambiance of the place is very dark, clean, and comfortable. The staff was exceptionally nice.We let Chef decide what to make for us. The drinks were very good. Made from fresh ingredients. This place also has a guiness surger! SCORE!The food is exceptional and the price is definitely reasonable.I enjoyed the grilled romaine salad. Very flavorful. The salad was warm and you can really taste the dressing and the individual flavors. The lamb was phenomenal. We enjoyed the Carpaccio, LOBSTER, and tortilla espaniola which is so authentic spanish.(It wasn't room temperature which is how it's supposed to be served) It was warm and tasty with the herbs and potatoes. Definitely try the duck breast. - I usually like it more rare, but it was definitely delish. The dessert presentation was very classy yet cutting edge. Truffles and Kai Vodka? PHENOMENAL! If you get a chance you definitely should try this out.I'm not really too sure why there were even bad reviews. HATERS!

I have this recurring dream where I'm lying in bed, and my friend Tyrone calls. And he's all "I can dig more clams than you!" And I'm like "No wai!" And then I spend the rest of the dream looking for a place to park. I don't know where that dream came from. I don't even know anyone named Tyrone.But if I did this is where I would take him. Because Black Bear Diner is as surreal as road trip dining gets. The ironic pictures featuring little bears trying to do what humans do ("haha! Silly bear! Manual transmissions are for humans! One day you will become somebody's rug! Ha ha!). The suspenders. Reading your menu from an old Goodyear Gazette. The faint presence of Wilford Brimley in the air. Wilford Brimley is everywhere, and can take many forms.*But alas, Tyrone is not real, and so therefore did not make a suitable dining companion. But Misty S is very much real (and very much my squeeze), so I brought her here instead.Our initial disappointment at the absence of African-American leather daddies aside, we quite enjoyed ourselves.She ordered the pot roast, and me the chicken fried steak. Both came with a side of mashed potatoes (you get your choice of two from a list of six or so) that came topped with gravy that matched the entree. This was done without prompting. I was so excited to see my meat and potatoes so perfectly accessorized that I nearly shat glitter.BBD's claim to fame is giving you a lot of food. It says so like twenty times on their menu. And in reality it is a lot. So much that you can hear the strained whines and cries of other patrons trying to finish their garlic bread. Or was it Texas Toast? I don't think it counts as Texas Toast if it's only grilled on one side. Why do I keep capitalizing Texas Toast? And why is everyone staring at me? Is it because I'm not dry heaving my way through my entree?Oh shit, is there glitter on my seat?*My review of Trader Joe's. Oh snap, self-reference!9/04I like!  Not all diners can take me back to my first months living in CA.  Stepping into this Black Bear Diner, I felt like I had stepped into my uncle's Buckhorn motel and restaurant (sold a long time ago), thanks to the comforting aromas of coffee and breakfast cooking on the griddle, and the hustle-bustle of a busy diner!Our server was friendly, prompt, and efficient.  No complaints there.  Still no complaints when we received our orders of the daily special of NY steak and eggs (which came with hash browns and choice of bread: muffin, toast, pancake http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=q7dK8yU76GIyLxt6KVjrHQ#q7dK8yU76GIyLxt6KVjrHQ , or biscuit) and a plate of biscuits and gravy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=EpBzkp0dH2QNe4m-F7F4dQ#EpBzkp0dH2QNe4m-F7F4dQ  Loved that she asked us how we wanted the steak cooked- medium rare to medium, please. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=30v8SVaQU2f7AcTsPIRd2w#30v8SVaQU2f7AcTsPIRd2w  Oh, and she was thoughtful enough to split our entree when all we had asked was to have an extra plate. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=RCVOGduEtBFY2S63er9qlA#RCVOGduEtBFY2S63er9qlA  She even remembered that I didn't want to have any of the eggs... cool.Everything was delicious!  The color/temperature of the steak was perfect!  I did ask for the hash browns be cooked extra crispy, and it wasn't, but no big deal, since we had the lovely biscuits and gravy to contend with, too.  (I suggest you get your fill of the B&G when fresh, 'cause they're not good eats hours later, most notably the gravy... ugh.)Glad to find another breakfast eatery to take my Mom to!I wrote a scathing review of BBD but I will reluctantly upgrade it from 1 star to 3 stars. David D. at customer service responded to my complaints promptly and politely. No...I did not receive a comp. nor did I want any. My only hope is they will take care of their problems as he stated to me in his reply so unsuspecting customers will no longer be taken advantage of. No....I definitely will still not be returning nor recommend them to anyone!One of my favorite places to eat breakfast in Arizona! When we go out for spring training each year, its a must we stop when we arrive in AZ , and as we leave AZ! Gets pretty packed but they get people in quick. Love their omelettes and all dishes are huge portions and good service. They even sell their own hot sauce which is good too! Recommend Papa Burn sauceBeing an Arizona native, walking into Black Bear Diner the first time was a surprise.  Whoa.  Did I get transported to Redding, California or something?  It was like we stepped out of the concrete jungle of Goodyear and into a log cabin in the woods.  Hansel, get Gretel out of the oven!I've visited this location for the past five or six years and the food is always great whether you come for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  The portions are generous and the food is always brought to you hot.  The chicken fried steak is one of my favorites and the chicken pot pie is pretty solid too.  I haven't tried their tempting desserts since I'm always beyond-stuffed by the time I'm finished with my meal but they got a delicious maltshake.  Malts... so much better than regular milkshakes!Black Bear Diner is a cute rustic-looking eatery with friendly service and good food.  Come and give them a try!  I'd take BBD over Denny's and IHOP any day.This place is literally within walking distance from my apartment, yet I have passed by it daily. This morning I was hungry for breakfast and had a lot of things to do so I thought I would try something close. I have noticed the parking lot is usually full, so I thought it must be good. I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table. The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee. The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone. The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee. I don't know how I have overlooked this place but based on the experience today, I would put it right at the top of best spots in town for breakfast. I will say come early because by the time I was leaving the lobby was full, people were milling around the parking lot, and the wait to be seated was 15 minutes.Fantastic food, but I wish I could give this location zero stars for my experience.  On Father's Day (two weeks ago) my family went to Black Bear Diner to celebrate my Grandfather.  There was a total of five adults and we ended up spending about $50.  The food was absolutely worth the money!  I got "The Griz" and it arrived on two gigantic plates filled to the brim.  It tasted great and was satisfying.  We were also celebrating a Birthday in the group and the server brought out a free peach cobbler for her.  The place was busy and a little messy inside, but this is to be expected on a day like this.  Up until this point, we were having a great time, but going to the restrooms changed everything!I had to take my very elderly Grandfather to the men's room, where there was what appeared to be a Black Bear Diner worker (wearing one of their shirts) exiting a stall, that was not properly flushed.  There was a second Black Bear Diner worker entering the men's room behind us.  The two workers exchanged fist bumps and words, before the first worker (who just left a used toilet) exited the men's room WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS!  I know he didn't wash his hands because since I was holding the door open for my Grandfather, my back was to the sinks and watched him slip right out the door.  If I did not have to constantly be at my Grandfather's side, i would have followed the worker out of the men's room and confronted him.  To add insult to injury, there is a sign next to the sinks saying employees must wash hands.  After exiting the men's room and washing up, we left immediately.  My stomach was churning thinking that this guy might have handled food without having clean hands.  As we left, a worker at the front desk was notified and she said she would take care of it.  I left an email that night with the main email address for Black Bear Diner and the Gilbert store.  After one week, I did not have any response, so I went to Facebook, where they finally responded.  I ended up speaking to a very nice lady at the Black Bear Diner headquarters.  However, since this location is a franchise store, it seems that headquarters cannot do much.  I told the lady at their headquarters to pass along my contact info to the Gilbert store.  It has been two weeks since the visit and have not heard anything from the Gilbert store.  The best food in the world can not make up for a worker not washing their hand after using the restroom.

I adore places that transport you to another locale without even driving too far! One beautiful sunny afternoon, I asked a friend to have lunch with me at The Farm Kitchen. We only drove 5 minutes away from the office and we were on a farm at a picnic table enjoying a wonderful lunch. The line had already started to form for the lunch at the Farm. We walked into a little building lined with racks of local product to peruse while you wait to get your order started. For my lunch I chose the turkey curry sandwich, a slice of pecan pie and a lemonade. Everything was really tasty. I could have used more mayo on my sandwich, but that was a personal preference. The curry on the sandwich wasn't overpowering. It was wonderfully complimented by the sweet cranberries. The pecan pie was so good! My lunch pal left her dessert alone to dig into my pie! The lemonade was, lemonade. Not to sweet, not too tart. The Farm Kitchen is a great place to step away from it all if only for a lunch hour. The food is good and well made, and the setting just can't be beat!I'm a huge fan of the Farm Kitchen on Maya's farm.   I frequent the farm businesses and I am a CSA member of the farm itself.  So, of course, I have very high marks for this farm in general.  The Farm Kitchen is a casual dining experience suitable for a date picnic or girlfriends lunch in an open air patio with quaint picnic baskets to boot.For the novice visitor to Maya's Farm, there are 3 restaurants.  The Farm Kitchen is in the "Little house" at the right of the driveway on to the farm.  This season, they stopped allowing cars to park along the drive to the back of the farm where the 2 other restaurants (Quiessence and Morning Glory Cafe).  Now when you come to visit The Kitchen, you have to park in the parking lot on the east side of 32nd street and walk across.once you enter into the Farm Kitchen, you are greeted with the aroma of some amazing baking or cooking.  It always smells so wonderful in there.  You will find some local food items in the store, even down to the locally made Poore Brother potatoe chips!  LOCAL LOCAL LOCAL.  Inside the Kitchen, you place your order from a menu that is loaded with your choice of sandwiches, salads, flavored teas, and soups.  They normally have an array of desserts to choose from as well.  I personally love the buttner squash creme brulee.Once you place your order, you go outside and wait for your number to be called.  Once your food is ready, you can choose to sit on the patio or venture over to the picnic tables or spread your own blanket and eat your food under the pecan trees.One thing of note;  you can schedule baby showers, et al with the kitchen.My personal favorites on this menu are:Tuscan Chicken SandwichItalian SandwichAny of their broth based soups.  Butternut Squash Creme BruleeChocolate Chip Cookies

Rereading my post, I'm aware that my review may sound to be a negative one, but I want to make it clear that I did enjoy the flavors of the dishes I tried.  It was the less-than warm reception to the questions I had asked- a perception I haven't had in a VERY long time (all the venues I've been to for many months, a few years, even, have been quite accomodating), and the long wait times I encountered affected the tone of this review.  ---I've had this "Taste of Phoenix" giftcard (purchased through Costco) good at restaurants such as Tapino, Picazzo Gourmet Pizza, Medizona, and Little Rangoon since pre-Christmas, so I decided to go for my first LRvisit last Friday.  Alfred, who I later found out is one of the venue's two owners (found a business card w/ his name on it), showed me to one of the corner tables (there were two occupied tables indoors and a full table outdoors).  After food allergy issues were covered, I ordered the two items I spotted on the online menu beforehand- Chicken satay app and Dhal curry.  I was starving and was thankful for the complimentary fried wontons and questionary dipping sauce.  It looked somewhat akin to Chinese duck sauce and was sure to contain allergenic ingredients (Alfred didn't check on the info).  Though I was almost starving, I had to ask Alfred to take the plate away, even though 2/3 of the wonton chips remained.  Thankfully, the two menu items I ordered almost arrived simultaneously, albeit after what I thought was a long wait for an app dish and soup (15 minutes for homemade soup I can understand, but 15 minutes for an appetizer of four 4"x1" skewers of grilled chicken skewers?).  Though it wasn't as dark in the restaurant as my photos would lead you to believe, the somewhat fatty satay skewers didn't have that gorgeous caramelization I'm used to seeing in other venues and as such did not strike me as "grilled to perfection" as stated on the menu.  The serving temperature of the skewers also seemed closer to room temperature than straight from the grill, but at least I was able to eat these right away since the Dhal curry was so hot, I had to let it cool for at least ten minutes.  The paratha that accompanied the curry was nicely plump and flaky when it first arrived, and, fortunate for me, I tore a piece and tried it with the too-hot curry then and so was able to enjoy its flakiness.  After devouring the slightly luke-warm satay skewers, which were very good when paired with the DELICIOUS peanut sauce (although I found it visually off-putting), I turned my attention to the curry soup, which was still very hot, but was so tasty that I decided to plow ahead (an almost visual truth since I was hungry!).  The split pea and lentil soup was a satisfying meal, yet I was expecting a more viscous consistency, closer to hummus, although I cannot fathom why, since dhal/daal curries of Indian cuisine are also on the watery side (at least Pasand's and Udupi Cafe's were, as I recall).  The cooled paratha was disappointing at this point since the flakiness was almost nonexistent, and the bread's texture was now almost pasty.  Should I order the dhal curry dish again, I'll have to ask that the paratha be brought out after the soup's cooled for a few minutes.I hope to visit soon for lunch where I hope I'll be able to give a higher rating.  In the meantime, please enjoy the pics I've included!  :)  Be warned- it took at least fifteen minutes for my check to arrive, despite the fact there were only three or four tables occupied at any given time (around ten people or under that).  Thought I'd also mention that while the take-out menu only indicated two dessert items (Sanwin Makin and Mango-coconut pudding), the server did show me a menu with many intriguing gelato desserts ranging from $3 scoops to $5-$8 sundaes and other creations!  Since I had the impression that Alfred didn't appreciate the food allergy questions I posed to him earlier, I wasn't in the mood to go into more detail with the gelatos' ingredients.  'Twas a shame, since my sweet tooth was raging after having consumed the spicy curry soup.Saturday night.Date night."Let's try somewhere new," I suggest to my man... and alas, he agrees!Ten minutes later, we find ourselves sitting in Little Rangoon.  We're the only ones in the place aside from the staff.  We probably would've left had it not been for the "People Love Us On Yelp" sticker on the door and Alfred, the friendly owner who was also our waiter...Jared not only agreed to go somewhere new but he allowed me to do the ordering.  The first dish that caught my eye was some sort of vegetarian dish that Alfred said people either love it or hate it.  He wasn't trying too hard to sell it, so we went with some more common (at least to us) choices from the menu:  spring rolls (the kind that are not fried) with chicken, a noodle dish similar to a pad seu eu, and a vegetable dish with tofu that we added okra to.  (I love okra!)Unfortunately, the chicken in the spring rolls was rubbery and kind of gross... and the vegetable dish was covered in a really oily sauce that lacked flavor.  I'd probably give this place two stars, but Alfred was nice enough and they serve okra - huge props for that.  Even so, the meal was pricey for what we had... and I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.  I hope it was an off night for their sake.  And now, because of our so-so / not fantastic experience, I am pretty sure I will not be allowed to choose the date night restaurant for a while... :(

Review Text :
Pretty darn amazing for a vegetarian menu! The owner was super friendly and I told her how much I love spicy fare.. she took care of me!!I ordered the Kung Pao Soy Chicken.. you don't even miss the chicken at all.. nice and spicy sweet with LOADS of veggies!! Also ordered the Imperial Roll Noodles.. yummy! I didn't even miss the BBQ pork that usually comes with this dish elsewhere. Lots of pieces of egg rolls amongst fresh cabbage and rice noodles.. she also threw in some Thai chiles.. my mouth, my mouth, my mouth is on fire! Can't wait go come back!!I'll admit... the thought of going to a vegan restaurant was a little scary for me. I'm no vegetarian, and a meal without a little meat just doesn't seem like a full meal. In fact going into Fresh Mint, we even made provisions to do a post-meal In-n-Out burger trip just to get our meat fix in for the night. As it turns out, we didn't need to make our 'meat run'... this vegan food is rockin! We got the kung pao soy chicken and a pad thai... both were very tasty. My soy chicken was so flavorful that if I wouldn't have known any better I'd have thought it was real chicken. The stand out here was the flavor... each dish seemed pretty perfectly seasoned; not too spicy but not too bland either. A lot of character and distinct tastes, which is always good. Service was pretty good, but nothing amazing. One funny thing that happened, and I don't know if this is a nightly thing or not... but they gave us a stuffed animal when we paid (weird lookin' thing). The guy that gave it to us actually said 'Guys get the check, girls get a doll'. Odd. Pretty solid place, although for the setting/decor it does seem a tad pricier than it should be. Give this place a shot!First off, let's give some praise to the concept: A vegan, vietnamese-style, Kosher restaurant? That's the coolest thing I've heard since someone explained nonstick frying pans to me. Unfortunately, the service can be a bit slow, and a bit weird, but you've got to give them some credit for opening a place like this.Most of the dishes are composed of rice/noodles, steamed veggies, and one of their vegan meats like chicken, beef, ribs, fish, etc., doused in sauce. It's awesome sauce (saucesome?) but it pretty much negates a lot of the healthier aspects of the dish. Why not wait to add those extra calories with some vegan carrot or chocolate cake instead? As far as recommendations, the lemongrass tofu rolls and green papaya salad are both light, filling and fresh tasting dishes. If you're a sauce-o-holic, opt for the tasty BBQ citrus spare ribs or soy fish in a clay pot.....For those of you who don't want to read any of that, refer to the short & sweet version below:Concept: hell yeah.Service: weird.Selection of "meat": awesome.Vegan desserts: much appreciated.Dishes: varied & satisfactory.Sauces: too heavy.Overall: 3.5 stars. I'll probably go back at some point.Eek! Methinks not, indeed!Okay, I never usually give a place a 1 star because I have this moral dilemma with it... BUT, I also never usually walk out of a restaurant. So, I walked in, was awkwardly greeted, and told to have a seat. It was lunch time, so the place was full, but not overflowing with stressed out customers. In all honesty, it was a typical lunchtime scenario inside. *I'd also like to note that I read reviews for slower than average service, so I was prepared to wait a little extra to try the food*Once I sat down, I noticed the server bringing menus over to the patrons that entered immediately before me, but he never came over with one for me. I decided to patiently wait for the next five minutes. That's when I started overhearing the conversation at the table next to me, and to sum it up:I don't know if we can stay and eat, we might have to get it to go.. We've been waiting a long time.Again, that's not verbatim, but it's exactly along those lines. I figured the reviews were right about the food prep times, and continued to wait. After a few more minutes passed by, another couple walked in, were acknowledged and seated, and after a minute, they were given menus (This is about 8-10 minutes in). It was then that the server came over with water for the first couple that had walked in before me. He then walked back to the drink area and brought out two more glasses of water for the couple that came in almost ten minutes after me. With no menu, water or sense of appreciation for wanting to spend my money at Fresh Mint, I got up and walked out.A good way to lose a customer is to not serve them. With service complaints since 2008 on Yelp, I really think something needs to be done. That was unbelievably insulting.

Beep, beep, beep.   No that sound isn't coming from a big truck backing up, it's from the wheelbarrow that they use to bring your food out on.  I swear, my portion was stupidly huge.  I had the Medchilada, ---Grilled chicken and mixed beans in lavosh bread, topped with cheddar and wood-fired. Served with brown rice, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, pico de gallo and sour cream.   It was hanging over the sides of the platter and easily was over 5000 calories and I couldn't eat a quarter of it.I looked over at the diner next to me and saw the largest fruit salad ever created.  IMHO, it should have been served in a bucket.  I'm guessing there were 4 bananas, 2 pints of strawberries, 1 bunch of grapes and a full melon in it. I really like the food at all the Pita Jungles, but damn some of their portions are way out of line.Good god I love Pita Jungle. Go there, eat, drink, be happy. The food is varied & fantastic, the service is good, the place is interesting.

This is a super cool wine bar, but expensive for the area it's in considering it's near McGill campus. However I went here with my mom and discovered it was the perfect atmosphere for all ages! Perfect for more of an upscale date but also nice for a place to relax before and/or after a dinner. The cheese plate is delicious but like any wine bar like this one it doesn't contain enough cheese for the price. There's a large variety of wines available dating way back but for our budget we chose the cheapest red wine available, but it was still deliciousAh, a wine bar. Plus tapas! When I see either one of these categories I get very excited, so when they're combined you know I'm happy as a clam. On my last day of vacation, while Adam was executing the "business" portion of our trip, I chose Pullman as our final restaurant stop together. I'm totally happy with the decision and I'd definitely return.First of all, Pullman is in a great location that was walking distance from our downtown hotel (right next to the amazing La Crepe 2 Go, which I'll review soon). The atmosphere is very chic and sexy. There's a gorgeous, sparkling, ornate chandelier right as you walk in, and there are many small tables and a little bar. We didn't go upstairs (but it looked fabulous up there like the rest of the restaurant) - we walked down a little half staircase to our own tiny table. And I mean tiny... Adam even had to share a stool with the person behind him. It was meant to be shared, of course, but it's just super close quarters. We had trouble fitting our food, plates, silverware, wine, and water on our table since it was literally like a 2X2 foot square. It was really lovely though - with only a little light from a single candle. Romantic and cozy.Our waiter did a great job talking about the wine and making recommendations. You can get little 2 oz pours of several wines for $4.5-$7 CAD each, a 4 oz glass for $8-$15ish, and a flight of three 2 oz pours for $22ish. We stuck with a regular 4 oz glass, and our favorite was a white from Slovenia. We mentioned to the waiter that we're not picky about wine as long as it isn't sweet, and he told us "there's no sweet wine on our menu." Well, good!For dinner we had the cheese board, the charcuterie board, and the Piri Piri short ribs. Ohhhhh man, I was in heaven. There were 4 very different and beautiful cheeses paired with 4 accompaniments (pureed fig, apple, some other kind of fruit jelly thing, and a walnut paste). The charcuterie board was AMAZING with 2 incredible sausages, prosciutto, duck, pate, a mustard cream sauce, grapes, and cornichons. The piri piri short ribs were phenomenal - the sauce was super spicy, but not overbearing. Nice portions and plenty of food to share on each plate. Plus, these tapas are definitely affordable. I'd say most items were between $8-$12. Beautiful meal and setting all around.

Friday night, meting a several friends for a drink. They had a live bad and the weather was great. That was the good of it. The server, while nice, was slooow and the drinks were weeeeak. The prices are average, which makes a bad combo. Once the band stopped and the house music started it pretty much killed the fun. Was not a fan of the food last time but neglected to eat this time.

Something about this place always told me to stay far, far away. But by all rights, all of us should try every Italian restaurant around, because someone, somewhere, must be nailing "Italian Restaurant", the triple-Axel of the culinary business. I just haven't found them yet.I should have listened to my impulse to stay away, but my wife has been wanting to try this place for years. For some reason we thought we would forgo some risk by using the To Go service and ordering online. Nay, the problems this place has pervade all its crevices. all the way out to the parking lot.I ordered some junk online: A small Caesar Salad, a Small Quattro al Forno, and a Small Eggplant Parmesan. It would be ready from 5:00-5:15pm. I got there at about 4:50 and a friendly lady came out right away and gave me the bill to sign. She said my food was "not quite done". Fine, cool, whatever. I was early. I could wait a few.A half hour later, it would dawn on me that "not quite done" in restaurant parlance actually means "We haven't started cooking your food." After I watched numerous people park at the To Go window and leave with their food, the harried lady finally came back out with my stuff, explaining that "they had to cut more eggplant". Ah, the mysterious "they" and their lack of kitchen management skills. An order for eggplant comes in online at 4:30.. why cut up any eggplant? Silly.I got home and discovered that the rest of my order had apparently been sitting around while the eggplant dish was prepared. The eggplant was moderately hot -- however, the Quattro al Forno was room temperature and so was the salad. The eggplant was way too thin and not seasoned well, and featured chunks of uneven Parmesan that had clearly been cut instead of grated. The Quattro al Forno might have been good when it was designed to be served, but its temperature made me quesy.When all was said and done, I realized that I'd consumed passable Italian food at quite a premium price with poor service to go with it. I felt full of lukewarm food and disappointed, which is really a strange sensation. I'm sure this place has its moments when it's hitting on all cylinders, but it ain't Sunday at 5pm.I held my company Christmas party here over the weekend and it was a wonderful experience.  From the moment I requested information on holiday parties back in September and was responded to immediately by the Sales Manager, Rebecca; to the moment I walked in for the actual party and was escorted to our private event room the whole experience was efficient, friendly and professional.Our party went smoothly, the food was delicious, the cocktails (with the exception of the mojito, which seemed to be mixed in an 'unusual' way) were very good, and the servers assigned to us, Jordan and another young man (who's name I didn't catch), were very efficient and friendly.  I will not hesitate to hold another event here.  I was really very pleased.I came to Buca with some co-workers for a job well done celebration. I'm not a real fan of chain Italian restaurants, but Buca is different with the atmosphere, being able to handle large parties, and if course family-style dining. We were seated in the Pope room which is fun but little freaky. Pictures of the Pope all over with a head of the Pope on the middle of the table and the Pope chair. Strange but cool having the Pope watch you eat. We started off by having the Mozzarella Garlic bread which was really good, the Chopped Antipasto salad, and the Apple Gorgonzola salad. The salads were pretty good not great but I thought it had a little too much vinegar for my liking. We had the Margherita pizza with fresh mozzarella which I thought was very good, Chianti Braised Short Ribs where they gave us three huge ribs that were boneless and covered in gravy which was very tender and very good. We couldn't have ribs without Rosemary Potatoes (meat & potatoes kind of guy) and they were really tasty and cooked perfectly. To top it off we had the Macaroni Rosa that had macaroni (of course) with a creamy sauce and chicken, broccoli and peas. It was really good. We ate it all up and had very little leftovers so that tells you the food was pretty good. No one seemed to be holding back. We can't forget about desert so we had the Dolce Platter which included Tiramisu, Double Dark Chocolate cake, Cheese cake, and Apple Crostata. The deserts were fantastic. Really good and everyone enjoyed it. The service was right on. Filling up our water glasses, beer, wine, ice tea, and soft drinks. Food came out in a timely manner too. So I have no complaints about the service. So overall, I had a very good meal with lots of variety of food and massive amounts to fill up everyone. Coming here is about having a fun time and good Italian food. So enjoy, eat up but don't forget to unbuckle that belt after you eat all that food.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?  I have lived in Charlotte for 3 1/2 years and only ate here for the first time tonight?  I apologize to my tastebuds.  Pulled pork, ribs, pot roast, chicken.....each one had an incredible smokey flavor and were cooked just perfectly.  I can't get over how excellent those ribs were....great bark on them, not too cooked down but not too tough either.  Green beans and mac'n cheese were excellent as well. Even got dessert...best coconut pie and pecan pie i have ever eaten.  You can tell it was homemmade! Service was great, atmosphere was fun. Do yourself a favor and stop going to Mac's and make this place your go to (don't forget about Bobbee O's in Northlake too though because they still have the best brisket around).This place serves the best pot roast you can buy in Charlotte. I put off trying this place because they don't serve brisket and while I like pulled pork I don't have the same love affair with it to begin with as I do with some nice juicy beef. Based on the reviews from other Yelpers I decided to go one evening after work to try this famous pot roast and I am now hooked.We were enthusiastically greeted upon entering and led straight to a table. I ordered a $4 mango mojito which was promptly served and it was as sweet as it was refreshing. Since we were basically starving upon arrival we ordered the appetizer sampler. In hindsight this was too ambitious for just the two of us since we were ordering full diners as well. The nachos and potato skins were delicious and the establishment did not skimp on the cheese. I loved the chicken fingers which were juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I am not huge on bone in wings but my dining companion said they were excellent. I ordered a soup as one of my fixin's, and it came out before the entrees as requested. It was potato and bacon and super creamy and filling. This could have easily served as an appetizer to hold me over until dinner.When the mains came (we both opted for pot roast) I saw the soup again and when the waitress saw she remembered that I already had the soup brought out but shrugged and said that I get two soups today. This was totally okay with me - free food is one of my favorite things. The pot roast was completely tender. There was some fat to pick around but the generous portion made me feel like I wasn't being skimped on. They must cook this roast for hours to get the beef so tender. The darker sauce (not sure what it was called, not vinegar based) that was at our table was a great compliment to the pot roast. Overall both the food and service were great and I will definitely be back! PS - the leftover pot roast made for great sandwiches the next day.

This place is pretty cool! Its inside Bass Pro Shop, which you think at first is kind of weird and would be really small, NO not at all! Bass Pro shop is huge and this restaurant is also. When you first walk in you can see a large fish tank that separates the front room dinning area and bar from the back dinning room. Once you get around the bar and the beautifully large fish tank, the restaurant opens up into a large dinning area. The celling is very high and the space in there is just so opening and welcoming. The decorations with the fish on the walls, the tables, the large fireplace in the middle of the dinning area, the paint, the fish tank..... it all works perfectly together to create an outdoor ambiance, with a lot of class and openness! I really loved the way they have this restaurant set up, its beautiful!Ok onto the food! We received an order of I believe sugar glazed bread when we ordered our drinks! Oh my goodness this bread is delicious. The sugar on the top gives the bread a little extra mmmmmm. It might just be me because I cant eat a lot of bread due to my gluten intolerance, but I had to have at least 1 piece! They have a great spread of different kinds of meals, from chicken, to sea food, to steaks to alligator! YES I said alligator! I have never had alligator before, so of course it was one of the appetizers I ordered just to give it a whirl! The best way to describe the breaded alligator, is that it has a shrimp texture, with a chicken tenderness to it. So its a mix of shrimp and chicken. It doesn't have a weird taste or bite to it at all. The sauce that was served with the alligator actually really played with the flavor well! It created a nice little extra bite to the gator to give it more flavor. For my main dish I had the shrimp pasta. The alfredo sauce was different, and really blended with the shrimp well. It was nice to have a dish with large pieces of shrimp to eat and not little bite sized shrimp. My friend ordered the cajun chicken pasta. This dish was served with the same alfredo sauce as mine but with the cajun taste instead of shrimp. I have to say his chicken was spiced deliciously and I enjoyed his plate much more than mine. The combination of the cajun spices along with the alfredo sauce made a great dish!The staff here was incredibly friendly, our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful when we asked about he alligator dish, the manager came and checked on our dishes as we were eating and everyone wished us a nice goodbye as we left! I like going to places like this, being surrounded by friendly people who enjoy their job and having a great meal, its just a great way to start off a good Sunday funday!

As you can see, I'm writing a lot of reviews these days because this is my last month on Yelp. Before I split, I wanna give credit to some of the unsung and under-appreciated small businesses in the NW area. DRAGON WOK is one of the better Chinese places that I have eaten at in Las Vegas. And I believe it's even better than most places on Spring Mountain. Summerlin/NW does not have many traditional style Asian restaurants. But places like DRAGON WOK are the closest you will ever get. This is not a generic panda express-like joint where food just sits out in a warmer. They cook it when you order it. They got amazing noodles here and the Orange Beef is also really great! I know that I get a lot of criticism from other Yelpers about how I tend to give "free" 5-star reviews out if the restaurant is operated by an Asian-American. Maybe some of that is true, but you need to realize that I am a 4th generation Asian-American whose family were direct survivors of the internment.  I'm always going to support Asian-American owned small business. But, DRAGON WOK does deserve every star I give it.

An all-inclusive place to hang out, eat, drink, and watch the latest sports on their multiple TVs!  With it being Vegas, no dress code or cover charge means it will be very popular!Walking in on a Saturday night, expect a wait of at least an hour because that's how long we waited for our party of four.  Call ahead to get yourself on the list since they don't take reservations for parties less than 10!  If you're lucky, you can squeeze yourself over by the bar and try one of their 100 to 250 beers on tap.  They say they do offer the "World's Largest Selection of Draft Beer."  You can order it by the pint or half yard, but watch out if you break the half yard glass; it'll cost you an extra $10!  But if you want a sampling, request their six-pack.  It's a weekly rotating variety of six different beers so you can get a taste of each.The best seats are in the booths, which can fit five comfortably.  The tables in the middle are for the big parties, but you're constantly being bumped into as people and staff attempt to squeeze on by.We went for a variety of appetizers to share:* Grilled Jamaican Wings: "tossed in jerk spices with rum bbq sauce" $10.25 - A generous amount of wings, but not enough of that sauce.  Full of flavor though and tasty!* Firecracker Wings: "tossed in a spicy sesame garlic plum glaze" $10.25 - Favored over the Jamaican wings because of the spice kicker.* Grilled Hearts of Romaine: "topped with red onions, candied walnuts and a gorgonzola champagne vinaigrette" $8.95 - Good enough to share with really nice walnuts and yummy dressing.  Even the guys in our group were fighting over it!* Baby Leaf Spinach: "portabella mushrooms, red onions, smoked gouda, tomatoes, croutons, and balsamic vinaigrette" $7.95 - Not enough portabella mushrooms, but I like the Gouda.* Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip: "main lobster, blue crab and artichoke hearts baked with a four cheese blend served with tortilla chips and grilled flat bread" $11.45 - Good dip, but not the most popular dish we ordered.* Barnaise Sliders: "four mini burgers made from Naturewell Natural Angus Beef served with fried onions, barnaise sauce, fries and pickle $9.95 - The fried onions make it taste really good, although the side of barnaise sauce sure doesn't hurt.  Even the thin fries taste good!* Classic Sliders: "four mini burgers made from Naturewell Natural Angus Beef served with cheddar cheese, our house special sauce, fries and pickle" $9.95 - Only okay after you try the Barnaise ones, stick to that one instead.  * Fresh Baked Brownie: "topped with mint chocolate chip, caramel or vanilla ice cream" $7.95 - Takes about fifteen minutes and meant for sharing.* Draft Beer Float: "Lindeman's Framboise with vanilla ice cream" $6.50 - Like a root beer float, but with Lindeman's.They do offer regular entrees like sandwiches, steaks, burgers, chicken, pizza, and seafood.  There's bound to be something on the menu for everyone, which makes this place a good choice.  The noise level is over the top though and you'll find yourself screaming to be heard.  (Not exactly the best place for a date if you're sitting across from each other.  But a good place to check out people and possibly make some new friends.  We ran into quite a few people we knew that Saturday night, so it's definitely a hopping place!)Since I'm still not a beer drinker, I like the Yard House because they serve up Lindeman's ($8, in a goblet) and Wyder's.  I can drink something I enjoy while everyone else is having their rounds of beer.They do offer Happy Hours: Monday through Friday, 3 pm to 6 pm; Sunday through Wednesday, 11 pm to close. Select appetizers are half-priced and drinks are discounted.  After 11 pm on Friday and Saturday nights, it's 21 years and older.  The crowd does change a bit and the skirts become shorter.  There's even a line outside by then, so come in earlier and get yourself acquainted at the bar.This place is kid-friendly since they do offer a kids' menu and their "Kids Klub."  But you probably don't want to take them here on weekend nights.Update! 05/31/08 - This time tried their (Mac & Cheese)2 "roasted chicken breast, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and parmesan cheese with castellane pasta and white truffle oil."  Next time, I'm going to skip the chicken because it's dried out.  But so yummy though when you get past the poultry part.A recent visit to celebrate a friend's birthday, Yard House left me feeling disappointed.  We had a large party, about 14 people at the table.  During our visit, we even had a shift change, where our original waitress was kind enough to let us know she was leaving and who was taking over.  Although the rest of our table had appetizers, The Husband and I arrived in time for entrees:* New York Steak Salad "green beans, roasted peppers, avocado, crispy potatoes, red onion and baby lettuce tossed in a gorgonzola vinaigrette with beefsteak tomatoes and pickled egg" ($16.95) - A generous and flavorful salad, loaded with the ingredients listed and a tasty steak.* Cuban Roast Pork Dip "tomatoes, pepper jack cheese, pickles, dijon and garlic aioli on french bread grilled with bbq au jus" ($12.65) - This was The Husband's order and I had a bite.  It wasn't that great, especially when I recall my previous experience with a Cuban sandwich.  The fries were good though.My concern was more with service.  The waiter asked the birthday girl what kind of dessert she wanted (out of three choices), and she went for the Chocolate Souffle Cake "mini serving with vanilla ice cream, served warm".  When it arrived, there was no candle which surprised us all.  (How are you supposed to sing happy birthday without a candle to blow?)  And he only gave us one spoon, which reminded me that he never brought back dessert menus for the rest of us.  At this point, we didn't bother ordering dessert since the birthday girl already had hers.  That part made the experience disappointing.The other waiter was able to do a split tender on the check, which was helpful.  (Although he put the costs wrong on my receipt, oh well.)  I usually think Yard House is on top of things, but I guess they weren't that night.Until last night's visit to the Yardhouse I was a big fan....now, I'm not so sure, here's why.A good friend and his fiance were visiting from California and wanted to get together for dinner & drinks.  Since Town Square is located on the Strip, it was a convenient place for us to meet.  Over the past few weeks I've been drinking a lot of IPA's and Chimay and was telling him that the Yardhouse would be a great place for him to give them a try.  Since they don't have a Yardhouse where he lives in California, we were all very excited.The Better Half and I met them at the Yardhouse.  It was pretty packed for a Sunday evening but we were able to find 4 spots at the bar in the corner so we could face each other and get seated immediately.  After browsing the beer menu, we decided on a Stone IPA.....the bartender said they no longer had it.  Ok, how about the Long Hammer IPA?  Nope...no longer carry it.  He proceeded to tell me they only had 1 or 2 of the IPA's on the menu because they are in the process of switching out the menu......what?  WTF is that?  I understand changing out the menu, but not being able to offer what you have listed until you make the change.....that's BS!  Especially for a place that claims to have 100's of beers on tap!  Ok.....well, if that's the case we asked for a Chimay Triple....guess what?  They didn't have any!At this point I was a little embarrassed because I hyped up this place as a solid "go to" place to enjoy new brews and good food.  We settled for a Ranger IPA and called it a day.For food we ordered Hot Wings, 4 Cheese Pizza, Jambalaya, and Sliders.  The Pizza was very soggy, even though I ordered it well done....that's the second time we've had Pizza and it come out soggy....we won't order it again.  The rest of the food was good, but not great.Overall, it was a disappointing night at the Yardhouse.  There are tons of places in Vegas that serve good bar food, but came here specifically for beers that were not available....and that's suppose to set them apart from the rest.  I hope this was an anomaly and not the beginning of a trend.Okay, there are a few things that are going to be brought up and I'm almost guaranteed to get a manager comment on this, but whatever, it's happening.Went here last night to try the Gardein line here. I was very excited to see that vegan meats have been added to some of their dishes. How cool is that?? But upon doing some internet research before we ordered, I found out that due to cooking methods, ALL of the dishes wouldn't be vegan OR vegetarian. They cook everything on the same grill as the meat. What sense does this make? None. It's like having a black coat and putting bleach all over it - it doesn't resemble a black coat anymore and is tainted. If you mix vegan food with meat, what is the point? And here comes why it is 2-star. IT IS NOT STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR THE VEG*N MENU TO BE COOKED IN A SEPARATE PAN. You have to go out of your way to ask for this, and even then a manager comes out to explain that it's not going to taste the same as if it were on the grill. Hmm - do you really think a vegan WANTS dead cow mixed in with her food? HELL NO. Granted, Yardhouse has already taken *some* action and put a little dot next to a few items that absolutely will come in contact with meat since these items are fried and have to go in the same basket as everything else. But they haven't specified that ALL the menu items will come in contact with animal products which is not okay. It would be really helpful if people who come here know this right off the bat. If I hadn't had my phone on me that night, I literally would have gotten sick since I haven't had any sort of meat in 6 years. Here's what I would suggest: just like other companies before you (Chipotle comes to mind), please automatically make all the vegetarian/Gardein items cooked separately from the meat. You don't want a lawsuit a la McDonald's. It is ridiculous that these vegan meats come to you and then you cross-contaminate them with animal sources to make them not even vegetarian. Oh and this isn't just for this Yardhouse, it goes for all of them - trust me, I will be contacting your corporate offices today. Also, it would be nice if you could put a little V next to the items that could be made vegan or are vegan on the menu. Makes ordering easier, and the confusion of your staff minimal.Anyways, I ordered the veggie sliders that come with fries, and we also ordered a side of sweet potato fries. Matt ordered a thai "chicken" pizza. After some back and forth, the sliders couldn't even go on the bread (only the wheat bread is vegan) so I got them protein style, wrapped in lettuce. The sweet potato fries we got as our appetizer were severely lackluster. Very bland, no taste, no toppings like sugar or anything. We couldn't have the sauce since it contained bacon, so I guess that's where all the flavor is. After the aforementioned back and forth with the wait staff, we got our food. Do they seriously only have the meat and the bun (in my case, lettuce) for the sliders? NOTHING else? No tomato or onion or even ketchup and mustard? For serious? The taste of the Gardein patty was wonderful, but for almost $11 for plain patties is ridiculous. The fries were way better than the sweet potato ones, but it just wasn't worth the price. I wish they would have suggested to make my order a veggie burger since that's essentially what they did anyways, was cut the patty into four pieces and pass them off as sliders. At least then I could have had the wheat bun and toppings. It was very difficult throughout the night to try and signal our waitress. I know it was very busy and that I did ask a lot of questions and such, but she was an expert ninja. Not the best customer service in the world. I also unfortunately don't see this Gardein line lasting here at Yardhouse. Until cooking the items separately becomes standard procedure, I can see a lot of vexed veg*ns. Honestly, what is the point of having vegan meats if they're going to end up on the same grill as actual meats? I just don't get that logic. Yardhouse itself is a bit pricey and I understand this, but at least give the customer the most you can. Plain sliders are not okay. In fact, I don't think I've been anywhere that has completely bare sliders. Due to the lackluster food, the outrageous price tag and the lack of good customer service, Yardhouse really deserves a 1-star review but I still love that a chain has decided to put vegan faux meats on their menu. The intent is there, but the execution is awful but can be easily improved upon. I might be back since there were other items that looked appetizing, but only when I want to deal with the headaches and the hassle. Until then, I'll stock up on Gardein at Whole Foods and make my own delights at home.I have been here about 3 times in one month, but I never complained until now. My friends and I went there earlier in the day to have dinner, but when we were waiting for a table, there were about five hostess' waiting there and doing nothing. After about 5 mins we finally got seated. They knew we were there, but did nothing.Other than that small incident, food is incredible! Id have to say the ribeye steak, macaroni and cheese are some of my many favorites. I've also tried a couple salads which were yummy as well!!Been coming here for years. I always get the tomato bisque soup to start DELISH! its very light and creamy with a touch of basil and homemade croutons. for the entree i can never resist one of two items. 1) truffle mac and cheese 2) seared ahi dinner.Mac & Cheese- very cheesy/creamy, bits of bacon and a truffle glazeAhi- Seared Ahi drenched in a Chinese black bean sauce with crisp basil on a bed of brown rice.these items are a must try!And now for the fun part.... THE BEER! ***Young's Double Chocolate Stout- omg its desert in a glass.***Big Sky Moose Drool- a creamy, slightly hoppy beer you could pair it with anything***House Honey Blonde- the perfect summer beer. amazingly refreshing***Sam Adams Cherry Wheat-  The best Sam Adams has to offer! a bright cherry flavored wheat beer with a crisp finish.. DELISH!***Chimay Triple- slight raisin taste with a touch of hops.. yum! perfect before dinner beer.why only 3 stars? the bar service is terrible. this location and red rock.After and independent of a UYE, when I join my Yelp friends for socializing at the Yard House, it becomes the Yelp House. The Yard House is a fun place for groups of friends to hang out over beer and good food. The restaurant does a commendable job accommodating large groups. Both times that I went to the Yard House we had no problem getting a large table. The service is precise. And when it is time to pay, we had our own checks. Substitute Yelpers for a gathering of general friends, or a date and the Yard House is everybody's social house.  The Yard House is my choice chain restaurant for beer selection. The Yard House is to beer what Baskin Robbins is to ice cream. Whereas Baskin Robbins features 31 flavors of ice cream,, the Yard House features approximately 600 flavors of beer (I counted the beer listed in the menu). If I were to go to the Yard House one Friday a week to order a flavor of beer, according to my math it would take me 12 years to done this. Or if I were to go to the Yard House everyday to try a flavor of beer, it would take me 2 years to do this. Some of the beers may have been listed under a couple of different headings. The deal is that the Yard House selection of beer is as good as it gets.   There are eleven series of beer. There is the chalkboard series. The cider series is the seasonals. The light beer is less than 5.8% alcohol content. This series includes many of the name brands such as Michelob and Budweiser. There is the Honey Fruit series which includes BBC Strawberry Blonde and Blue Point Blueberry. There is the wheat series that includes Blue Hawaiin Hefeweizen. The Malty series includes Bass Ale and Alaskin Amber. The Dark series includes Big Sky Moose Drool and Bison Organic Chocolate. The bitter series includes Anchor Liberty and Blue Point Hoptical Illusion. And there is the Strong and Effervescent series. The menu lists the alcohol content. Unless I overlooked something, the Allagash Curieux is the strongest at 11% alcohol content. There are three sizes of beer. I went for the middle size which is the pint. For the record I greatly appreciated the Firestone.  This very Yard House features a Happy Hour and Late Night Specials. The Happy Hour is Monday-Friday 3-6 pm and Late Night Special Sunday-Wednesday 10-close. They include domestic pints from $4.25-$5.75, well drinks $4.27-$4.75 and wine by glass $2 off. If you are up to food there are half price appetizers & pizza.  The food is good but I've tasted better. My complaint about the roasted turkey club is that it was layers of sandwich instead of the sandwich I am accustomed to. The classic cheeseburger was a good choice. The fries are these skinny things that remind me of potato sticks. I feel that the Yard House ought to expand their fries selection to include steak fries and just thicker fries.  When I socialize at a restaurant, I am big on the music that is playing. I was won over by the music playing. I heard great music from Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones and classic rock era.  The Yard House excells at their selection of beer. Whether it is my Yelp House or social House I intend to return. When I return I plan to try the Blue Point Blueberry beer that is brewed in Blue Point, NY; 5 miles south of where I lived. Gotta be patriotic to my home town.Daniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 72Had a fantastic lunch/dinner here during their Happy Hour.   We were immediately seated and greeted by our server Seth.    He was outstanding during our entire dining visit. We had a few questions about different menu items and he was very informative and helpful!  Plus he had a great quirky personality that makes him a great waiter!Since it was Happy Hour, they have many 1/2 price appetizers and deals on drinks.  We decided to split the Chicken Nachos and Bearnaise Sliders.   This was a fantastic deal as our nachos ended up only being about 5.50 and the sliders were around 6.50.  The chicken nachos were delivered on a huge plate!  This plate alone would have actually been enough for both of our stomachs to be filled.  They had a great combination of ingredients with plenty of chicken spread throughout the nachos.  Fabulous! The sliders came out with 4 on the plate and a side of shoestring fries. I didn't see that fries were included so that was a bonus.  Plus I love shoestring style french fries.  Yum.  The sliders were just ok.  I almost wish we ordered the classic style sliders.  Yes I did love the bearnaise sauce that accompanied the sliders on the side but the burger itself was very plain.  It still enjoyed them.  Their dining area itself is spacious and roomy.  There are plenty of seating inside and on their outdoor patio.  Everything was kept very clean and tidy! It doesn't hurt to see their keg room when you first walk in...  puts a smile on my husbands face!  It is a great place whether you are visiting or a local.This place is always crowded when I go. Even after happy hour has ended during the middle of the week!  So if you are planning a get together, call ahead and make a reservation. Even then, there might still be some additional wait time for the tables to be cleaned up and reset for your party.The biggest draw for hitting up Yard House is probably their beer selection.  Because the food is just alright overall with highlights here and there that I have discovered. For arranging parties when you don't know where else to go, Yard House is a safe bet.  Everyone in Vegas that goes out even occasionally will know about it.Love watching sports and paling around with friends or near by strangers?  This is a good spot, if you are willing to wait for an open table or vacant chair at the bar.  There are plenty of flat screens to occupy your attention.Looking for a quiet intimate and relaxing place to chill and grab a bite?  The noise alone will get this place crossed off the list.  But you are also not going to be spending the kind of money you would expect to pay at a restaurant with nice tablecloth and illuminated by real candle lights.The service is okay to way above average.  What I do love about coming here with a large party is that the waitstaff has been trained to keep track of who ordered what, so splitting the bill at the end of the night is as painless and effortless on the customer's part as it is going to get.  Uber kudos for that alone!I would almost give this place a 4 stars, but for that to happen the food has to be better.I've enjoyed Yardhouse in the past, however, my most recent encounter with one of the managers, Leo, has really affected my overall experience and opinion of this restaurant. Leo informed my group of friends sitting at the bar that one of my friends would have to leave if she couldn't sit still. It was her birthday and I will be the first to admit she was slightly intoxicated... I would understand if my friend spilled a drink, broke a glass, screamed obnoxiously, or literally fell over in her chair which she did not. She. Did. Nothing.My friend was a little tipsy and the manager was quick to judge. I understand that if someone at a bar seems intoxicated it is a liability issue, however, I feel there could have been more professional and polite verbiage used to relay that message. This was not the the case. Leo was cold and came off rude. The group I was with were all surprised and shocked because as I said earlier, the friend we were with by no means was acting obnoxious or creating a scene. I asked for the man's name who happened to be the manager and he told me it was Leo. He also tried to grab his business card and realized he didn't have one with him. He didn't offer to retrieve one for me either.... I get it. Working in the restaurant industry I know there are a lot of difficult and intoxicated guests to deal with (I've been a server back in the day myself) however, there is also a thing called empathy and delivery which goes a long way. I don't work in the restaurant industry anymore but I do work in guest service management. The manager could have asked politely what he would have liked to occur, but that didn't happen. I hope Yardhouse management improves because I actually really liked that place. My interaction with Leo really bothered me (still does). Mitch, a bartender working at the time tried to defend Leo and didn't show empathy as well. He event spelt his name out for me because he was very confident in defending why I was wrong to feel offended with my interaction with Leo. Not sure if Mitch understands what the interaction consisted of. He sure was quick to make me feel like I was in the wrong.Unfortunately this recent experience has really affected my overall experience with Yardhouse. I will not be recommending anyone to this restaurant nor I will be returning. Being a large chain as they are I hope they improve in customer service to retain some loyal business.My 1st time at this Yard House location and had a great time! I've been to the LINQ location twice and Red Rock location several dozen times and I liked this Town Square location the best.The outdoor patio offered an excellent ambiance with impeccable service by Rob, a week ago Saturday night. The draft beer and cider selection are abundant, tasty and intoxicating! The baseball game was on nearby TVs within eyesight for those with glasses, contacts and/or previous Lasik surgery patients. I suppose people watching would be entertaining from the outdoor patio gazing off into Town Square, however I was focused on great conversation while sharing many laughs :-)I look forward to returning again soon while the weather has finally cooled.YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #233

Restaurant name  Shane's Rib Shack
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
So in my quest for a new lunch spot, I dragged my co-worker and his wife to Shane's. We were greeted at the counter and the menu was so big, we had to step aside to read it all. We finally were ready to order our lunch!I opted for the Shack Sampler which comes with: 1/4 rack of ribs, 2 chicken tenders & 1/4 lb. pulled pork with 2 sides. I chose greens and macaroni and cheese. All this was delivered to my table!The food was pretty darn OK! The ribs were falling off the bone, and the sauce wasn't too terribly candy sweet. The chicken tenders were well seasoned and tossed in a hot wing sauce that wasn't very hot. The pulled pork was moist and tender and covered in the same sauce as the ribs. The greens were meh... they were sweet! Something I'm not used to. I was hoping for something more smoky/salty. The macaroni and cheese was not the kind that "Big Mama" used to make. It was tasty, but not homemade.I was delighted to see that they have Sweet Tea!!! Yay! That was a major plus for them. I wanted to try their peach cobbler so I went back up to the counter to order some. OK, I know some people are going to disagree with me, but I LOVE my cobbler doughy. Here's the catch, the dough has to be tasty. Shane's won on that tip too! I loved that the peaches weren't too terribly sweet, and there was a good amount of dough in the bowl. I plan on hitting up Shane's again for another "semi-southern" fix. It wasn't WONDERFUL it was "A-OK". If you want WONDERFUL, you'll have to hit my parent's kitchen in Spring, Texas. In the meantime, hit Shane's for a taste!texas toast with bbq brisket or bbq pulled pork.. choice of side: mac and cheese. fries. baked beans. fried okra. corn on the cob.   oh the heartburn. oh the delicious heartburn. no jokes, this place is great. they have free wifi, too. my inner nerd was greasy and pleased.

Restaurant name  Z'Tejas Southwestern Grill

Review Text :
This location is extremely 'group friendly.'  I just made up that term, but it's true... I've been to this Z a handful of times with large groups and I've never been disappointed.  Maybe it's because it's a central location and they've got a private lot for parking... or perhaps it's because of those chambord margaritas? or is it the chips and salsa? or the cornbread?  Whatever the reason, I'm giving this Z a 4 star review because of previous good meals and for the excellent service we had tonight.I called in the afternoon and had no problem getting a reservation.  Julie who answered the phone was really sweet (always a good sign), and Matt, our server, was extremely personable and attentive.  We had a group of 8 - including a few picky eaters.  We started with chips (which are house-made) and salsa, guacamole, and grilled shrimp & guacamole tostada bites... On top of that, the GM brought us over the beef tostadas and shrimp & pork dumplings - this was a very sweet gesture and much appreciated - we finished every last bite of both!  The dumplings were cooked to a golden brown and really tasty.  The beef tostadas were yummy also; I think these are both new menu items that are being tested - hopefully they will stay since they were both pretty impressive!After sampling all of that, I still somehow managed to eat my dinner salad with a light lime vinagrette dressing; it was good but nothing special.  (Nothing like their Achiote Chicken Chopped Salad which is my favorite menu item to order when I go to Z for lunch)... And then my 'Grilled Miso Salmon' entree - actually, not as good as I remembered, but tasty nonetheless... other entrees at our table included the halibut special, blackened tuna, porcupine shrimp, seafood enchiladas, and a couple of entree salads.  Everyone was happy and left full - and for just over $30 a head including tip... not bad!I'll be back to visit this Z again soon for sure... it's a safe bet no matter your reasons, and it's great for groups!  Word of caution: be careful with the chambord margaritas - they dangerously good!Z'Tejas is quickly becoming one of our top "go to" breakfast places in town. They've got reasonable prices, the service is always great, and the best part of all is that they've got an amazing brunch menu...and don't even get me started on the cornbread.  It really is like having an extra little meal on the side and it's some of the best cornbread I've ever had the pleasure of slathering butter on and shoving down the gullet. Oh...and did I mention it's free with every meal? Yeah...makes us wanna high five the waitress each time we go there.A few of our favorite items on the brunch menu are the breakfast quesadilla, bananas foster french toast (very sweet), and eggs benedict.  We also make sure to get the chips and salsa trio with any meal here since their chips are always nice and fresh like they just came out of the oven (or wherever fresh chips come from).  There aren't a ton of items on the brunch menu, but it suffices and never leaves us dissapointed. The combo of good food and good service here should be the gold standard for chain restaurants...Z'Tejas knows its shit...they have fresh/fun food, and they have wait staff that are personable and always seem enthusiastic about the menu...can't ask for more than that. The only reason Z'Tejas isn't 5 stars is because is doesn't have that jaw dropping 'wow' factor with any of the dishes we've tried yet...it does have the "mmm...that's realllly good" factor going on...but not quite the "Arrrrgggh, I'm gonna have a seizure from overloading my taste buds with too much pleasure" factor. Still...a great place. 4/5.

While waiting for work to be done on our car at the nearby Best Buy, we wandered across to City Tavern to quench our thirst with a couple of beers. It was great that they had some locals on tap, including my favorite Captain Jack from OMB. We also shared an order of the lobster nachos, which were okay but not not as much quantity as I expected.Quiet on a mid-week afternoon centered between lunch and dinner but the service in the bar area (several TV's tuned to sports channels) was good.

Z-Cafe is a very cool little restaurant that serves up both Breakfast in the morning hours and a tasty Lunch during the rest of the day. They also have some really good looking Smoothies and fresh Cookies to enjoy.Just happened to find this place with my Yelp "nearby" button. I had the craving for a hot Sandwich and the photos got my stomach growling. Their PDF menu on the internet has all of the items they serve and it is very easy to navigate.Ordered the The Bloom Sandwich with Turkey, Bacon, Provolone, Cheddar, Avocado, Red Onion & Chipotle Sauce on Sourdough Bread with a side of their Homemade Potato Salad. It was very delicious and all of the ingredients were very fresh.They have several other cold and hot sandwiches as well as breakfast items in the morning There are also Soup and Salad options that can be ordered as a meal or they can be combined with a sandwich purchase.Service was very friendly and the place inside is very clean. I was very impressed with how important it was to them that my visit was both pleasant and expedient.Definitely will be back to try out some more of their yummy menu. The prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes are just right without going overboard and putting me into a food coma. SAMMY TIME!4 STARS

Restaurant name  Maizie's Cafe & Bistro

Review Text :
I finally made it to Maizie's for lunch last Tuesday.  It was hopping, but my party of 2 got lucky and didn't have to wait for a table to open up.  We received a warm welcome and all of the staff including our waitress, Sarah, and Maizie herself went out of their way to make sure we were happy with our experience.  This place defines a locally owned boutique restaurant... it's great!The space is small, but adorable!  Very hip and modern yet has a laid back and fun energy going on.  There were a mix of people (young and old, business and casual) enjoying their lunches while we were there.  Although we didn't indulge, the wine list looked extensive for such a small place, so I'll have to return for that!  I ordered the Krazy Kobb salad - it was a really big portion.  I will admit, I didn't love the oriental salad dressing, but Sarah brought out the sherry vinaigrette as an alternative that I liked better.  I think I will try something different next time though; it still didn't blow me away.  I am sure it won't be a problem finding something since their menu is pretty diverse.  Maybe I should've taken advantage of the fact that I was there on a Tuesday - they have a 'Taco Tuesdays' special where you can order $2.50 tacos that are served with rice & beans, $2.50 Dos XX and Corona, and $3.50 margaritas!So, Maizie's had great energy and plenty of food/drink to choose from.  I don't think i ordered right this first visit, but you live and learn.  I look forward to returning to try some of the other menu items; maybe even Sunday Brunch!Quite the menu for such a tiny venue. OMG. I love a good rhyme! Maizie's made me a bit, um, crazy. Oh. Again. With the rhyming. I'm channeling Nipsy Russell. Impressive, cozy, urban space. And when I left. A smile on my face. Sadly my lunch choice, much like Elaine Joyce (this pop culture reference will really separate the young from the old), I say with a sigh, was dry, dry dry. I ordered a Milano sandwich with Italian meats and cheeses. Seriously. No. Really. Seriously. Quizno's or Subway would have been better. The fries were great, served with a "southwest" dipping sauce, i.e., mayo with chipotle sauce. The creamy artichoke dip with assorted, hot and fresh chips was yummy in my tummy. God. That was lame. Overall, my co-diners were "satisfied" with their lunches, not, however, going crazy for Maizie's. That said. I have high hopes, even when not high, for this Central Phoenix newbie! And the service was spot on I might add. Great vibe. Don't hide. Don't be lazies. Find Maizie's. Ok. I'm going to go back to playing with dolls and blocks now.I like Maizie's...I like it a lot. I think that for what it is its a good addition to the area. I met Melissa H., Christine O. and Melissa H. for happy hour today and I was quite pleased. Their specials, which run from 4-6, feature a good selection of $5 apps, $3 beers and well drinks, and $2 off glasses of wine. There were two wines on the wine list that I am a fan of so that made for a very happy hour. (Or two) The space is small. Intimate. Cozy. But not New York cozy where they have to pull out the table so you can slide into the booth. Its definitely more restaurant than bar. I like it because it fills a nice niche, its cute, its neighborhood-y, and its inexpensive. The menu is pretty large. Although I just sampled a few apps and soup (gauc- ok, could have used more cilantro, salsa- pretty decent, spinach artichoke dip- good, and french onion soup- very good, wished it was a larger crock) I would be willing to try their sandwiches (perhaps not the entrees) and I definitely want to try their brunch. Once the light rail is up and running I think I'll be here for brunch quite often! You have to understand what Maizie's is....its a neighborhood restaurant. Not in the Applebee's kind of sense but in the sense its one of those places you can count on when you don't want to cook and just want to eat out. Its not a special occasion type of place. Meet friends there for happy hour or grab a bite to eat before heading out..There's something about the vibe at Maizie's that feels so comfortable. It feels retro to me... a flashback to Indiana in the late '70s - early '80s. Maybe it's the giant bowls they serve the salads in. They make me think of Pizza Hut after a softball game circa 1980. Here are some things I like best about Maizie's:The wingless buffalo dip is deadly -- I mean that in a good way (and it should be on the late night menu). It's gotta be mostly cream cheese... how can you go wrong?!The fries are good, but the potato cakes are frickin' awesome! Thick mounds of really yummy mashed potatoes with a hint of horseradish, barely browned on either side.The inside out burgers are literally filled with the items described (my fave is the Feta burger - stuffed with feta cheese and sun-dried tomatoes and served with a thimble full of chipotle humus that packs a slight punch and is great on top of the burger as bizarre as that sounds)Only been here one time, but so far so good.  Had one of the inside out burgers (very tasty) and some cheesy buffalo chicken appetizer that was pretty good so I can't complain.  I need to go back and try many more items because everything looked so good.Kind of a small place so it was loud and crowded, which I guess could be a good thing for a restaurant these days.One word can sum up my experience at Maizie's- Unremarkable. The restaurant is a cute place, and I really wanted to like it. The service was slow. Our server would disappear for long periods of time, leaving us with empty glasses, and we watched as other tables got their food, even though we had ordered before them. I am not sure what is so difficult about making a sandwich, but clearly there was some rocket science type stuff going on back there that caused a 25 minute wait for the food.I had the veggie burger with fries, and my sister had a salad with ancho orange dressing and a cup of potato soup. I didn't try the salad, but the dressing was described to me as "tinted mayonnaise with no flavor". The thick and chunky potato soup got a better response- it was actually really good. About the veggie burger...kudos to Maizie's for making them in-house, but for crying out loud- could you give them some flavor, please? I now understand why the burger is served with apricot tzatziki and red onion marmalade- without them, the burger is tasteless. Ah well, the fries were good. One more nit picky thing that drives me crazy about this place- spelling errors on the menu. Seriously, there isn't a computer today that doesn't come with some form of spell check. Use it. I doubt I will be back to Maizie's. Nothing about the visit thrilled me.I like Maizie's.  Well, I've been 3 times in the last week so I guess I should say I like Maizie's a lot.I went for this first time a week ago with the fabulous Dottsy Z for a little much needed Happy Hour after work, and it was pretty packed.  Dottsy was kind enough to secure seats for us at the bar while I fought the wonderful PHX rush hour traffic.  They had $3 off all wines by the glass which I must admit was a pretty impressive selection, and they had a decent list of appetizers that all cost $5.We each ordered some wine and decided on the buffalo chicken dip.  HO-LY-CRAP this dip was good!!  I love the taste of buffalo wings but I hardly ever eat them because they're really messy and I invariably cover myself and whatever I'm wearing in them.  And as attractive as looking like a 5 year old is...Anyways, this dip is like the answer to my buffalo chicken prayers.  Came with a huge helping of pita slices and chips and it was delicious!!  Definitely going back for the dip alone!Luckily I don't have to.  Next time I went was Monday evening, and wouldn't you know it?  $3 burger and fries specials EVERY Monday night!  And they were gooood.  That pretty much ensured that I will be there every Monday from here on out until my arteries are so clogged that I have a heart attack and need to have a bypass.If that means I get to keep imbibing at Maizie's, I will take my chancesI still stand by the potato cakes (although they are flat and not thick any more) and the feta burger - whole heartedly! And, it is true the chicken on the southwestern chicken salad is well seasoned and has a good kick (appropriately soothed/complimented by the corn, jicama, peppers and mixed greens)... but, my most recent trip was on a Sunday and we sat at the bar to avoid the wait.Our service was excellent, even though they were really busy. Tina, the bartender, was engaging and offered up some great suggestions. That's how I found out about: the Drifter pale ale - a very refreshing beer with hints of grapefruit and apricot and LOTS of fizz! the $3 mimosas during brunch and, while I don't do bloody marys because of the tomato juice (yuck!) I had a taste of Tina's secret recipe spicy mixer and it's pretty dang good!! I could imagine drinking one of those bloody marys... Plus, I noticed they have a Sunnyslope high school football helmet (along with one from Brophy) displayed above the bar! We all know I'm a fan of Sunnyslope... so, for all of these reasons, I'm adding a star!i was really impressed with this impossible-to-park-at cafe. i think i committed three moving violations in two minutes trying to find a place to park and being trapped on the southbound side of central (stupid awesome light rail!). on an aside, anyone else not able to say or think "moving violations" without thinking of that 80s movie with bill murray's much less talented brother? and that song!anyway, i kind of expected my florist buzz surrounding my florist quality service and options. not at all! all servers were incredibly friendly and helpful - a feat given my dad's refusal to read a menu. it must be told to him, by a beaming, pretty waitress, please.patio is quite noisy and cramped - btw can't they do something about people locking their bikes to the fence since their handlebars stick into your sitting space and take up even more precious space?? they're prob the servers' bikes ... so work it out!we happened to go today, on St. Patrick's Day, and they had a special menu of Irish-inspired entrees. dad picked corned beef, mashed potatoes and gravy. i have never, ever tasted corned beef that was good. ever - it's typically stringy and tough. this was delicious, and they won my hard to please dad like whoa.i chose the cali spinach and added chicken; and that cheese, dressing and almond combo is divine.and yes, bonnie, not only did my dad enjoy this hipster joint, but that garlic bread is pretty good, too.I have forever banned Wendy's because of the square burger.  I think it's weird.  Maizie's changed that for me tonight.Went with Julia, Ayesha, Georgie and some guy Julia works with.  See, it's $3 burger night!  I'll put aside my disdain for the square burger.I got the house burger, which came with a side of fries.  Burger was H U G E huge!  That's OK.  I was H U N G R Y hungry!  It had lettuce and a slice of tomato on it, along with some slices of purple onion.  Served on Thick bread, like a ciabatta.  The fries still had the skin on them - my fave!  Lights dusted with some salt that had a bit of kick to it.I love that they also have Pellegrino.  I love sparkling water.  It makes me burp, which is what I *really* needed after that big, square burger!I've been here before on a Monday, and that was tight. The boneless buffalo wing dip deserves sonnets to be written about it. It's nearly orgasmic. No, really , I think I did leak a little eating this dip. It's just that good.Today, I experienced brunch at Maizie's and it was pretty solid. The four of us all ordered the Classic brunch--two eggs, breakfast potatoes, bacon, toast. Props to the potatoes, as they were delicious and garlicy and crispy and perhaps the most lovely potatoes I've had in such a long time. The mimosas were great! Get the bottle of champagne with a carrafe of orange juice. Have fun; don't drink until you're drunk and drive recklessly.There are two things that keep Maizie's from being five star in my book:1 - It is so warm that I felt like I was having early onset menopause2 - They are in an unfortunate location if you are going northbound on Central, because you have to flip a biatchHere are the things that make Maizie's pretty awesome:1 - $3 Burger Night Monday2 - $3 Beers during HH3 - $5 Bruschetta (that is freaking amazing)4 - Awesome bathroom with tasty smelling orange lotion5 - Cool looking bar6 - Big, open windows7 - Cool Aesthetics8 - Kung Fu Girl Riesling9 - Friendly, accommodating staff (especially for our large party)10- Lot's of options for everything: Food, Wine, BeerI really liked Maizie's a lot and I cannot wait to be back :)I met Roxy for wine and pizza Tuesday evening.  I showed up at about 6:20pm and the place was packed!  The place is little, but adds to the charm.  They don't win any interior decorating awards, but it is cute enough.  We sat at a two-top right in between two other two-tops.  We even chatted with our neighbors a bit.  It seemed the others were regulars.  Server Ed was super friendly too.When I arrived, Roxy had already ordered me a glass of wine and a pizza.  So I did not look at their menu.  Doesn't matter though- the pinot grigio was very tasty and on happy hour I believe.  The pizza was very, very delicious.  Great crust and sauce and their version of the Margarita pizza was spot on.  Traditional tomato, basil, and mozzarella, with added pancetta.  it was fabulous. It was a perfect summer dinner for 2 ladies.I'm sure we will be back soon, it's nice to break up the Postino's trips now and then.I have been on a quest to find the best fish n chips in CenPho.  I had heard they had a Tuesday fish fry at Maizie's and really love the place, so I had to give it a try.Four smallish pieces of fish, a stack of chips (with malt vinegar!!!), homemade tartar sauce and a couple of hush puppies.  Oh, and a side of slaw.I think the batter was a little bit much.  Hush puppies were dry.For $13, I had expected more.  It's only $8.25 at Turf and way more fish.I've been to Maizie's several times and the food is consistently good. Monday's are pretty bustling for the $3 burger plate and wine specials. It's chaotic but well worth the madness considering the deal. The wingless buffalo dip is one of my favorite plates and we've even been able to duplicate the recipe for a few of our own house parties. Another highlight is Maizie's Sunday Brunch. The red chili is awesome and so are $3 Mimosas & Bloody Mary's. We recently tried the Tuesday Fish Fry which was also great. Plenty of fried fish, a hefty serving of fries, two hush puppies and a creamy corn tartar sauce. The Half Baked dessert (warm cookie with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream) is the perfect ending to any meal and enough to share with at least two others. Additional high marks go for location (walking distance from the Central & Camelback light rail stop), patio seating (especially this time of year), wine punch card club (buy 5 glasses and your 6th is free. SCORE!) and the beer and wine selection. Service on a normal night is always great. Not so easy breezy on Monday nights or during the mad rush for Sunday Brunch. Certainly not a deal breaker for me, I've got a wine punch card and two more glasses gets me a freebie.Damn you, Maizie's... Why are you so damn delicious?!Maizie's has become my temptress as of late, luring me out of the confines of my apartment to dine on oh-so-delicious food, and drink great local beers all while not breaking the bank. I'm honestly more than a fan of this conveniently located restaurant. Maizie's is a well-decorated and well-staffed eatery with a menu that has the ability to please almost any craving a diner could have. I've yet to have a bad experience here whether it be with the food or with the staff. Also, they have some fantastic daily specials and a happy hour (M-F / 3-6) that rivals most in the valley. Some of the dishes I've tried include their Wingless Buffalo Dip, Bistro Tender Steak, Pizza Burger and the Matt's Pesto Manifesto Pizza. The dip was a bit much for me due to sheer guilt, but it was exactly what you would expect it to be, and the steak sandwich was above average, but just a steak sandwich. The other items though are fan-FLIPPIN-tastic! That pesto they use hits some high marks for me, and I find myself craving it much like crack-rock when I don't have it after a while.Every experience at Maizie's so far has been a great one for me, and I waited until many visits went by before writing this review. It's probably not for everyone, but it's one of my favorite spots for sure.I have now been here 3 times and my first time was great, as I stated in my first review.  But my last 2 visits have not been a pleasant experience.  I went for brunch a few months ago with a group of ladies, 25 of us, and our service was pretty terrible.  First we had confirmed the number of people in our party the day before but they still seemed unprepared for such a large party.  Our server was pretty rude as well, I swear she never cracked a smile.  Our party arrived within 30 minutes of or reservation time, some right on time others a little late and we had the large center table and 2 booths.  Our server stated after only 15 minutes and 12 of us being there that she couldn't hold the tables if we all weren't coming.  We assured her we were and everyone did show up.  It was the continual little things, not refilling water, not bringing fresh, chilled orange juice when we ordered another bottle of champagne for mimosas.  Rolling her eyes and sighing when we asked for the check to be split and never saying thank you before we left.Last night was so bad I won't be back.  I met with a friend for their pizza and wine special which I was super excited for.  The biggest problem was the bartender, she was rude, inattentive and totally cut corners when it came to making us happy.  We ordered a pizza and one of our toppings was goat cheese but only on one half.  When our pizza arrived it had mozzarella on one half and goat cheese on the other when the mozzarella should have been on the whole pizza.  This is a totally honest mistake and I can see where the confusion could have been in what we said and what she translated it to mean. But instead of apologizing she was a bit argumentative over what she thought we said when we ordered.  To make matters worse instead of having a new pizza made she asked the kitchen to just add the mozzarella on the side that was missing it and re-fire it.  What?!  It was charred in some places, dried out and all together simply not very good.  We were starving and contemplated sending it back, but twice in one night just seemed too much.  There was a nice gentleman that worked there who asked how are pizza was, bartender chick never did, we actually had to get her attention the first time to send it back.  We were in the middle of explaining why we didn't really like it when Ms. Snarky says "if you wanted me to have a new one made for you, you should have just asked."  WTF?!  I have worked in restaurants and usually when someone sends something back you remake it!  You should have done that in the first place!  She was so rude and it was really hard to even be polite to her at this point but I remained in the acting like a lady zone.  The did take it off our bill and gave us a free dessert.  Let me be clear, it was the gentleman who gave us the free dessert, he was very charming and apologetic.  If Ms. Snarky was nice about everything I wouldn't be writing off Maizies forever, but the icing on the cake was when she sat at the bar one seat down from us to eat her dinner.  I think that is very unprofessional but that wasn't what bothered me most.  The lady that took her place behind the bar and Ms. Snarky had a 10 minute bitch fest complaining about customers and how they can be such a pain in the ass.  The proceeded to regale each other with stories of how customers have annoyed them.  We paid our bill and left.  Ms. Snarky didn't say one word to us on our departure.  There are so many great places in the same area with a much nicer staff.  Those are the places I will be spending my money at.There are things about Mazie's that I just love. Like the sandwiches, expecially the turkado... It is exactly what it sounds like and delish. The breakfast burrito is amazing and covered in gravy. The benedict plates are okay. The hollandaise isn't my favourite and the eggs aren't poached... sad face. But so far... Everything else I have had there has been pretty amazing. Breakfast pizza has an egg on it... EGG! (If you like your eggs runny, order them sunny side up. The over easy eggs were overcooked) Also I love the sweet potato fries here. My favourite! The wait staff is always super friendly. Always quick to pick up plates and refill glasses. I love the ambiance. Lovely little signage hanging on the wine rack: Wine a little, you'll feel better. Thought that was really rad. There's not much else I can say about Mazie's that hasn't been said. Cool place to grab brunch or watch some football at the bar.I want so desperately to like Maizie's. The food is good, the atmosphere is decent, and it's on my street, just a 5 minute walk from my front door. Unfortunately after two terrible and embarrassing experiences I have decided to boycott them for life.On Sunday I was meeting someone for a business lunch. He suggested Carly's, I suggested Maizie's. He called Maizie's to see if they had any specials. The woman on the phone said that they have happy hour from 2-4pm on Sundays. When we got there we ordered some drinks from the young man and I asked "what's on special?" He laughed and said "we don't have specials on Sunday." I told him about how we called 20 minutes earlier and were told about happy hour. Again he laughed and said that they have never has specials and looked at me like I was lying. I asked to speak with the manager. He would not get the manager to come over. I said "do I have to get up and find the manager myself?" He said "do whatever you want."I spoke with the manager (blonde woman) and explained the backstory. She repeated the same statement "we've never had happy hour on Sunday." I told her I didn't care about that, I just want to know why I was told this on the phone. At this point most people in the packed restaurant were staring at us. We decided to leave since she was clearly uninterested in fixing this problem. After we went to Carly's (for a great dining and drinking experience) we got a call from the manager at Maizie's. She found out what employee gave us the incorrect info and offered us a couple free drinks. Nice try but I can't be bought off that easily. Free drinks doesn't make up for the bad attitude, terrible customer service, and embarrassing situation in front of a lot of people.Usually one bad experience isn't enough for me to give up on a place I love, but this wasn't the first time. The last time I came to Maizie's was 6 months ago, and there is a reason I haven't been back in 6 months. My girlfriend and I just finished our $100.00+ dinner and drinks and had paid our bill. Ten minutes after we paid, as we finished our drinks, a waitress came over to us and asked us if we would leave so that they could seat a large group that just walked in. No other tables were open, she didn't offer to move us, she asked us to leave. Seriously messed up and also embarrassing. So we left. I'm done leaving this place angry. Maizie's is done.Afternoon happy hour from 2 until 6 is very generous. This laid-back establishment is a perfect place to while away the afternoon blues on a hot, hot day in July.The appetizers for $5 and the sangria for $3 make this a feel good sort of place. You don't save much on the wings but the rest of the appetizers are a good deal. The hummus is very tasty and the doughnut wholes are a great snack or even a light dinner.The wait staff is efficient and our food and drinks were all correct when delivered to us. When we were there everyone sitting at the bar was wearing black. Possibly this is the required garb for acceptance into Maizie's cool club. If you just want a place to hang out, this is a viable spot and it won't cost you an arm and a leg. They have a few parking spaces out front but there is additional parking out back. This place is easy to find as it is on Central, just south of Camelback.

Restaurant name  Ruth's Chris Steak House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
My score is solely a reflection of the level of service we have received on several visits to Ruth's Chris - Madison.  I find their steaks to be excellent.  Mine have always been cooked perfectly to the requested temperature and well seasoned.  The sides and salads are great too.I decided to finally write a review after having dinner there last night.  First off, it is restaurant week and they are particpating in it.  However, they place the menu for restaurant week at the very back of the menu where it would be easy to overlook it.  I find that to be borderline shady.  Next, when we told our server, Honey, that we would be dining off of the Restaurant Week menu she turned ice-cold.  It was obvious she was not happy - eye rolls, quick short sentences, and her ability to ignore us as she walked by.  Her attitude throughout the entire meal was poor.  Frankly, she had the personality of a small soap dish.  Finally, the pace of the meal was really rushed.  Appetizer, Steak with side dish, one drink/beer each plus a bottle of wine, and dessert - total time at the table?!?  ONE HOUR.  Our impression of the evening was that Ruth's Chris was trying to churn-and-burn all the Restaurnat week dinners.The food last night was of the same high caliber we have had in the past.  We enjoyed it very much.If a restaurant is going to participate in Restaurant Week they should, in my humble opinion, embrace it rather than discourage it.  If they really don't want the Restaurant Week dinners because meals are discounted, no problem, just don't participate.  Not a big deal.  Several of Madison's finest restaurants do not participate and I don't hold it against them.  The lasting impression from Ruth's Chris - Madison is that they really didn't want us there last night.  OK - we will dine elsewhere from now on.

Restaurant name  Amante Pizza and Pasta
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Amante has some delicious salads, pastas and good pizza. The best part for me? It's right down the street from my house. The decor is freakin awesome. Lots of columns & neat decorations, you'll feel like you're dining in an upscale restaurant, but the prices aren't that bad ($9 - $15 for most pasta dishes). We really enjoyed the food, but they no longer have a liquor license. According to our server, they no longer serve alcoholic drinks since approximately 1 month ago. Again, I like the food, but I want some freakin wine with my Italian dinner. This short-coming will keep us from becoming repeat visitors.

Had to stay standing for almost 10 minutes when all I wanted was a drink. There was no line, only a bunch of lazy employees chatting it up on the side while only one of their crew members was left calculating prices and working out the transactions by hand since none of their registers were working. +2 stars for the lady busting her ass and delivering great service at 1am. Should've caught her name.

Review Text :
I wish I was rating this place higher. However, lack of follow through from management leaves me no choice.Quick review: Got a big group? Don't bother calling and setting things up with Dianna. You'll feel like second-class citizens. It's sad, really.I knew something was wrong when I called on Wednesday to try and see if this place could accommodate our #evfn (East Valley Friday Nights) group. When I asked the person if they could accommodate 30 people, he suggested I call back and speak with Dianna the next day. Odd, but OK.When I spoke with Dianna on Thursday, I explained that we'd be bringing 30 people for a combination of dinner and drinks. She readily agreed that they could handle such a crowd, and said she would be happy to reserve A) a section of the bar and B) a group of tables contiguous to the bar, as not everyone would be eating dinner. Great. Sounds perfect, as some of us like to mingle, and setting us in one long table doesn't help with that.When we arrived at the schedule time, we found four small round tables pressed together near the bar, where a grand total of three chairs were unoccupied. You do the math. 30 people it was NOT going to accommodate.As the attendees began filing in -- and the space quickly filled -- we spoke to the management (possibly Dianna, though she never identified herself) and secured another table near us that was soon to vacate. Another four-top.As our numbers quickly swelled to the promised 30, there simply wasn't room. And this was around 6:30, so it's not as if we were early. Some of our late arrivals grabbed an available table -- only to be rather rudely told by management that the table had been reserved and that she had "already informed them that there were no seats available.". Great. So much for making room for the 30 we had spoken about.In the end, we called it short an hour into the evening. Having the bartender also act as our server was a huge mistake. The boy did what he could, but there was no way he could keep up with the growing bar patrons -- not our people -- and our swelling numbers. So everything was delayed -- including out trying to get the hell out of there so the place could return to normalcy. I'd not be surprised if some tabs went unpaid. Unfortunate if it happened, but patience only lasts for so long. And remember that they AGREED to allow us to bring the event to their establishment.The kicker? When one of our attendees mentioned that things weren't  going so well. Dianne's answer? "I told the man who called that we couldn't handle this size of a group, but you all decided to come anyhow!" So in the end, the shitty review. You'll probably see more. Up front I said this was unfortunate. And it's true, for the food was excellent. I had chili rellenos and was quite impressed. However, I'll never go back to this place because of bad service. And mind you, all of this was pre-arranged. We never went over our promised 30 people. Hell, they couldn't handle us when we were less than 20. It's not even communication failure. It's follow through failure.So feel free to try this group when it's a party of 2. Anything larger... you're on your own. And forget reservations. And abandon the idea of talking to Dianna. She obviously isn't anyone who can follow through.Having arranged our large group in advance, we were given 1/2 the space we needed, the restaurant itself was uncomfortably warm, and the service was awful - to put it nicely.After not being allowed to sit at one of the four open tables, several of us sat at the bar next to other patrons (not with our group) who were drinking and eating. When we mentioned to the bartender, whose attention it took almost 15 minutes to get, that we would like to order, he was clearly put out at the prospect of having to deal with it.A few minutes later when I asked for a glass of ice water, the bartender said "NO. Not at the BAR". When our food came, it was delicious (although one of the orders was wrong).In general the entire staff at the restaurant seemed put upon by our group.It's a shame, really, because the food was delicious. Pretty sure I won't be returning to Blue Adobe Grill.But the food was excellent!Too bad the service was so poor.  I'd called earlier in the week (Sunday) and asked if the restaurant could handle a group of approximately 30 people from 6-8 on the following Friday.  I was assured they could and that I should verify the reservation by Wednesday.  They also suggested we choose from a shorter menu to expedite everything.  Fine.  The other organizer called to verify and was assured we were welcome.  I arrived early and found four round tops set aside for us, plus one end of  the bar.  We shoved the tables closer together hoping to get another one into that corner, but no such luck.  The single waiter struggled to take drink orders and then food orders as half our group ended up standing and shuffling around other patrons attempting to get to the restroom.  We did snag one more table but when we tried to get another one, a woman who I assumed was the manager asked those people to move - that table was reserved.  (Though is was not used until much later as we tried to check out)  A few of our group at the bar were at first told they couldn't order food, and another couldn't get water.  We realized they just couldn't hand us and tried to get our checks.  I had to pay my drink order and my food order separately.  Two people got their checks and the rest of us ended up standing in a line to pay our bills.  Nobody helped this one poor waiter at all.I realize we have a large group but we did call more than once in advance and were assured there wouldn't be a problem.  When I mentioned to the manager that we were not please with the service she informed me that it was our fault, and that she'd warned us they were overbooked.  Gee, I don't remember any conversation that went that way.As far as I know, none of us had any complaints about the actual food though.  I heard many compliments and my meal was very good.  Its just that we were made to feel unwelcome, the service was very slow and the people at the bar seemed to have quite an attitude when our people tried to order anything but alcohol.Don't say you can handle a large group and then drop the ball before we even get started.This was my second visit to Blue Adobe, and I won't be back. The first visit was for a family birthday dinner, about 10 people, and they had trouble coordinating our tables, goofed up our orders, and generally didn't seem to care about us much at all. But the food was tasty (once they got it right) so I thought I'd try again with the EVFN group.Two of the staff seemed trying to help, but everyone else either ignored us or seemed inconvenienced by all of us ordering dinner and drinks. What a mess.Now I know the service problem wasn't a fluke. It seems to be a restaurant living on a very good cook's skills in the kitchen, and those skills are the only reason it isn't getting a single star. For good New Mexican style food, I'd suggest Los Dos Molinos not too far away.I was among the large group several other reviewers mentioned that visited Blue Adobe Grille. The points they made in their reviews were right on the money. Because of that, I'll keep this short and add just a few more.The one server taking care of the group was hit and miss. He paid attention to some and seemed to ignore others. I was encouraging him to go around the table to take each order but instead would take one at a time back to the kitchen, and ignore others as he was walking away. Not very efficient. Still, he was trying, so I'll give him that. One of the two stars above goes to him.I shared a chicken quesadilla and bean queso dip appetizer. Nothing complicated, but it WAS good. The plates others had looked appetizing also - when and if they ever got them. That accounts for the second star.The manager, walked up to me at one point near the end of our visit. I was standing by our assigned 4 tables chatting with another person in our group. In an annoyed voice she said, "I'm going to have to ask you to not crowd the other tables."  I was 3 feet away from the next table - I counted the tiles on the floor just to make sure. Is 3 feet considered crowding?  Those three blank stars? Lack of follow-through, lack of service and lack of accountability by the manager.

I'm a real sucker for a feel good story and Jerome "The Bus" Bettis is all of that and more.  So, what fan of the 5 time Super Bowl Champion Steeler's doesn't wanna eat at Jerome's restaurant?Located in the Del Monte building near Heinz Field, the outside patio has an awesome view of the Pittsburgh City skyline.  On a hot Saturday afternoon, we opted for inside.  We were here for a late lunch, so we didn't get really adventurous.  My friend had a highly recommended Fried Italian Hoagie.  It was stuffed with salami, pepperoni, cappacola, provolone and hot peppers, battered and then "yes" deep fried.  It was crazy good!  My simpler tastes went for the Apple and Blue Cheese Salad with sherry bacon vinaigrette and candied walnuts.  Needless to say, I helped my friend polish off his hoagie and we took most of my salad home!  They also have the very best raspberry iced tea ever!Service was great.  We had a team of servers attending to our needs, not just one.  They seemed to be working as a mob, even though the place was busy.My friend commented that the men's room had a two way mirror, I could live without knowing about that.  4 star restaurant, get's another star for being Jerome's.  I said I'm a sucker.  No, I'm a fan.  I love it!The only word to describe this situation is HORRIFYING. I'm going to start this with clarifying statements.1. I know how busy restaurants get on Saturdays. 2. I understand it was exactly the time for that late dinner/drinks crowd.3. The North Shore gets crazy when there is a Pitt game, even away games.4. I have worked in restaurants before. THE WAIT:That all being said, we expected a longer wait for a table. What we didn't expect though, was to be told that they "in no way could even give you an estimate on how long this will take."  We had a party of 5 people, not a large group at all. After standing outside in the beautiful weather drinking beers, we soon realized that we'd been waiting for nearly 2 hours.Eventually this lovely hostess, Christine, approached us (they call your cell phone when a table becomes available) and asked us how long we'd been there. We told her and she immediately got us a table. She was truly a great employee. THE FOOD:Finally seated, it was another 5-10 minutes before a waiter came over. His name was Bobby and he was clearly young and new to serving. He was running circles around the tables. He obviously had a full section. 2 in our party ordered wings as an appetizer and those actually came out really quickly. They smelled great and I don't think either of them had any qualms with the taste either. This is where took a quick and crazy downturn. We asked the waiter for napkins and refills on beers, we didn't see him again for 10-15min. I actually had to flag down a bus boy/food runner for napkins/silverware. The waiter stopped back and we reminded him about the drinks we needed, which by this point had gone from 2 to 4 beers. We placed our order and 1 in our party ordered the 36 steak. In case you're not familiar with this it's a 56$ 36oz steak. This is a serious piece of meat. He ordered it medium well, and the waiter did let us know that this may delay the food coming as this steak is thick. The rest of us ordered various burgers. By this point I'm starting to get hangry (an anger driven by extreme hunger). I made certain to stop and tell 2 manager/supervisory types how great Christine was doing and she had even stopped back to check on us just to make sure things were ok! THE HORROR:We have been at this place for 3 hours now. Waiting for food for a little over 1.5 hours. The general manager stops over to our table with some of the absolute WORST customer service skills I've ever encountered. He did apologize, but it went like this... "We really don't know when you food will be out. Our kitchen is sort of down right now. It's coming eventually, bro." The member of our party who ordered the 36 actually asked him to just forget the steak and get us 5 burgers to go so we could go back to our boat. He also mentioned that if the meal was free we would leave with our burgers to go, make sure to really take care of the server, and leave as happy as possible. The manager's exact words... "I don't care if the server gets taken care of, I just want the customers to be happy." I was so offended. As I mentioned, I've worked in the food industry as did someone else in our party. That's just too much. The food came out about 5 minutes after that, including the steak. The steak was so bad that my friend couldn't eat it. It was cold and dry it almost made me choke. This was Denny's/Eat N Park grade steak, not 56$ steak. My boyfriend and our friend had the deep fried burger, I tasted that and it was delicious too.  Here is where I snapped though... I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger with a side of sweet potato fries. I am shaky at this point as I've been on a boat in the sun and haven't eaten anything. I put the top of the bun on my burger and grab a steak knife as I almost always have to cut a burger in half. I saw the burger in half, drooling as meat juices (I also like it medium rare.) and bbq sauce is squishing out. I pick up half of the burger and notice in the very low lighting something far brighter pink than the meat right in the middle of my burger. A PIECE OF PINK PLASTIC IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BURGER. I knew immediately what it was, it was the medium rare indicator that they are supposed to stick in the top of the burger. It was laying flat IN THE MIDDLE OF MY MEAT. I shot up out of my seat and took it right back inside and forced the manager to take it from me. I reminded him that this food can't get any more free than it is right now, and I don't have another 3 and a half hours to wait for food. He tried to tell me that it couldn't have been inside it. To which I picked up the other half and pulled the cut in half indicator out of the center. I didn't even get to eat dinner after 4 hours of waiting.Never ever ever again. I left starving and angry.

We come from a place where Asian cuisine is spectacular, where it's cooked by people who can't speak a word of English but make the most exquisite Asian cuisine.  When we moved to the states, we were expecting to find better food out here, since the states promises better and bigger things.We tried the great Asian restaurants in the Venetian, the Forums, and every other place you can think of.  Even the locals suggested a few asian buffets, but to our dismay the food was just "okay", and not the great flavors I sought.One day, out of sheer luck, we passed by this restaurant and finally decided to stop in.  Walking in felt like home; the counter in the front, the nice, homely tables around the sides, and the music just like the stuff played over the speakers at the Chinese and Japanese restaurants where we're from.The service, for a small restaurant, is impeccable.  Not only are they there to give you refills without asking, but the food comes out fast and extremely well plated.  Our first experience here happened to be what we've sought--great sushi.  We tried their tempura sushi and tuna, and to our amazement, we were finally home.Their culinary delights include their fabulous tempura that, in all honesty, beats the hotel restaurants and buffets on and off the strip.  Theirs is real tempura--light, crispy batter, perfectly brown and very well seasoned.  Their bulgogi, kalbi, and barbecue chicken is a delight.  If you order anything that comes with a special box, you must eat their macaroni and regular salad.  Even their miso soup is excellent.  Compared to a five star restaurant at home, this place is up there.I'm not exxagerating when I say that this is the best Japanese and Korean food in Vegas.  It honestly is, and if you want a taste of real Japanese and Korean food is, you MUST eat here.  Since my discovery of this place, we eat here every day for dinner, and we will continue to because their food is the best in Vegas.  Hands down.

I love the BBT as a cheap dive bar and for the great polish food.  I almost always get some pirogies and some kielbasa.  Most times after I order I see an old polish woman come out from nowhere and start cooking up my food!  It is definitely not health food, the 'rogies come out dripping in butter with some onions (and some sour cream), and the keilbasa comes simply as a giant delicious mouth watering link on a plate.  Although if there is a group of people who order different types of  'rogies you are almost guaranteed not to receive the mixture you ordered.  The live local music is fun, the beer fridge has a decent variety and a $1 bottle night on Thursdays, and their fries are good for snacking too!I'd really like to give this higher ratings, due the the $1.10 beers, decent bar food and friendly owner, but my last experience left a sour taste in my mouth.A group of friends and I were there on a Thursday in March, having a few beers and eating some Polish food at the bar. Now, if you haven't been here before they have 2 TVs behind the bar, about 15 feet apart from each other.It was like any other Thursday in March - cold and rainy, half empty bar - except it was the beginning of the NCAA basketball tournament. My friends and I were hoping to catch some of the games and we knew BBT would be a little iffy because the Penguins were playing (normal, regular season game), but we figured we'd ask the bartender if we could get a basketball game on one of the TVs. It couldn't hurt to ask, right? Wrong.The conversation, with the female bartender, went a little like this:Friend: "Excuse me, would it be possible to put the tournament on?"Bartender: "Don't you know the Pens are playing? Aren't you a Pens fan?"Friend: *looking down at his Phillies shirt* "No, I'm not from Pittsburgh."Bartender: "We can't change the channel. We have paying customers who will leave if we change the channel."Fair enough, we knew it might not happen. We even excused the bartender's terrible logic (inferring that we weren't paying customers; we certainly paid for our drinks and meals). And that was fine with us. We were perfectly content to continue hanging out and have a few more drinks before moving on.However, that was not possible as the bartender refused to serve us for the rest of our time there. No, it wasn't an honest mistake; she knew we had empty beers and were trying to order more, but every time she came close to us she dipped her head or averted her eyes. It was quite obvious. Eventually she had to come in front of where I was seated to make a drink for another customer, and that was when I was finally able to make eye contact to ask for another drink. She said OK and walked away, never to return.And that's when I decided never to return.No Ms. Bartender, what makes paying customers leave, contrary to your popular belief, is not changing a channel or the lack-thereof.  It's disrespecting them.I visited Bloomfield Bridge Tavern on Fri. evening around 6:15 with a friend from out of town and her dad.  I had been wanting to visit BBT for a long time, and her visit provided the perfect opportunity for me to try it while exposing my visitors to a very Pittsburgh-esque environment.  After battling the crazy traffic on Liberty due to the bridge closure, missing the entrance, and battling it yet again, we parked and made our way inside.As others have mentioned, the interior is definitely divey, but not smoke-laden, unlike many other dive bars in PGH.  We were carded literally as soon as we walked in the door.  We originally thought we'd sit out on the porch, but decided against it, given that the porch is a smoking area.  At the time of our visit, it was pretty empty, with only a handful of locals seated at the bar, and a few people on the porch.  The environment was pretty quiet, given the sparse crowd and lack of music, allowing us to converse freely.After perusing the menu, my friend and her dad each ordered a big hop ($5 each), and I ordered the Arsenal Cider on tap (Fighting Elleck; $6.50).  For food, I ordered 6 pierogies (2 potato/cheddar, 2 farmer's cheese, and two sauerkraut), which were on special for half off at the time of our visit ($0.75 apiece) with sour cream ($0.75, as I found out later), as well as an order of potato pancakes and applesauce ($5.95). My friend and her dad each ordered the red polish platter, which comes with kielbasa, a potato and cheddar pierogie, golabki, haluski, and kluski ($10.95 per platter).  All of the food was delicious and extremely filling, and the drinks helped to wash it all down.Upon eating all of my pierogies, I noticed that, despite my request for 2 pierogies of each flavor, 3 sauerkraut and only 1 farmer's cheese had been included in my order.  I mentioned this to the woman who bussed our dishes (different from our waitress), and asked if I could have another farmer's cheese pierogie, since that was my favorite flavor.  She said she'd get one for me, and a farmer's cheese pierogie was brought out to correct the mistake at no charge.Overall, all of us greatly enjoyed our visit to BBT.  I'd highly recommend it if you're in the mood for good Polish food, or are just looking for a genuinely Pittsburgh-esque eating experience. If possible, try to come on Fri. or Sat. between 5-7pm to take advantage of the half off pierogie deal! 4.5 stars.

It's been at least 5 or 6 years since the last time I visited this joint.  I worked at the Eldorado Casino back in the mid 90's and this place use to have decent food......that was back when it was named "Cactus Joe's".  It's really gone downhill since those days.I happened to be in the area and stopped by for lunch with my Mom.  I ordered the Nachos w/o Meat and Mom ordered the Fish & Chips special.After a short wait we were served our food.  I was disappointed to see that the Nachos were Chips, Cheese Whiz, Tomatoes, Onions on a plate with a small bowl of Beans, cup of Guacamole, cup of Salsa, and two packages of Sour Cream on the side......what the ___?  Was I suppose to create this thing myself?  Where did it say that on the menu?  I know why they did it.....to save money.  There's less food waste when you do stuff like that, but seriously?As a fan of Nachos it was a huge letdown.....plus they didn't taste good at all.  The Chips weren't fresh and the flavors were just strange.....unappealing.Mom enjoyed her Fish & Chips, which were really Fish & Fries.  She liked her Fish and I tried a few Fries...they weren't bad.  Maybe I ordered the wrong item?Overall, the service was good and since Mom enjoyed her dish I'm giving this place 2 Stars instead of 1.Will I return?  Someday I probably will for the sake of nostalgia....but I predict it won't happen any time soon.

I've had a nasty bug and have been eating lots of soup.  I decided to check with Yelp and see if there are any Japanese places close to the office so that I could have some miso soup for lunch.  This idea led to the following:"Mido Sushi!""Yes, do you have Miso soup?""Hello?""Do you have miso soup?""Mido Sushi!""DO YOU HAVE MISO SOUP?""Soup?  Miso?""Yes.""Hello?""YES!""Mido Sushi!""MISO SOUP!""You come get!""Ok.  Hello?""Click."*from the next office*   "You're having miso soup for lunch?  Sounds good."So the miso soup was inexpensive. I got basically a quart for about $1.75. The broth itself was pretty good but it had minimal tofu and no scallions or other garnish.  Average miso at best but when you have the flu it works well.

"EXCUSE ME!"Such was the theme of the night.  Trying to get good service here is nearly impossible.  Servers would walk past our table without even a second glance causing us to have to scream and flag them down.  Ugh.We stopped in for some drinks and dessert, after an early dinner elsewhere in NoSco.  After our experience I'm not sure that I would return for lunch or dinner....and it makes me wary to try North.  The mini cannolis had a very overpowering lemon flavor.  Cannolis are my favorite dessert....in my life I have had about 50 billion of them.  My wedding cake had cannoli filling.  I have never had lemon flavored cannoli before. It was half gross and mostly disgusting.  The chocolate and hazelnut "cake" was really a brownie in the shape of pie with a lot of whipped cream and some hazelnuts on top.  Not quite what I was expecting.The drink selection is pedestrian as is the beer and wine selection.  Then there is the water.  Holy cow I felt like I was drinking a glass of the chemicals my parents put in their pool.  It smelled awful and tasted absolutely disgusting.  I forced it down but oh man, they need to adjust their water filter.Its all open seating according to the server we ran into on the way in.  Although when we made the move to a newly open table we were told it was reserved.  What is it? Open or reserved?  Once we got a spot on the patio we were treated to parents letting their children run through the fountain at Kierland at 10pm.  I don't know...when I was 7 years old I wasn't running around crazy at 10pm at night.  (And I was most certainly not in Bar North after that having dessert and whatever.  Who brings a kid into a bar at 10pm on a Saturday night?!) Then came time for the check.  We waited so long for our server to pick it up that I actually had to go to the bar and pay for it there. All in all I was completely unimpressed.  Given the bizarre cannoli and the mediocre "cake" combined with the terrible service I'm not sure I would go back.....the only reason its getting the third star is because the pickings in North Scottsdale are slim.NoRTH is a great place to go for lunch or happy hour if your near Kierland. This is one of the better Fox restaurants with great food, fantastic service with a somewhat trendy northern Italian decor.  We miss their location on the west side on 67th.They offer a lighter side of Italian cuisine with an emphasis on freshness. This is not the place to go if your looking for the heaver side of Italian with loaded meaty sauces and carb-o-roma items galore.  They offer some classic carb loaded dishes and pizzas. But for the most part they offer several wonderful dishes on the lighter side with loads of fresh grilled seafood, chicken and veggies.  Their zucca chips or bruschetta with prosciutto and crescenza cheese are great starters with a glass of wine. The baked ziti bolognese with spinach, ricotta & mozzarella cheese is delish,  The pasta with butternut squash is also very good.  I always order their grilled chicken sandwich with a side of seasonal grilled veggies or their ahi tuna salad which is devine.  Their happy hour is fantastic with bargains on drinks and several apps. They have great service and will accommodate most special request for those with special dietary needs.Had dinner here with a colleague recently.  After browsing the menu, decided to go for the Baked Ziti (Bolognese, Spinach, Ricotta, Mozzarella Cheese, $16) and a glass of 2007 Frog's Leap Zinfandel, $12.50.  The weather was awesome, so we dined outside on the patio.Our server was awesome and made sure our glasses of Wine were never empty.  The food came out pretty fast.  I took one bite of my Ziti and instantly became a fan!  The Bolognese Sauce had the right combination of Spinach & Ricotta to make a heavenly dish....the proportions of ingredients was just right so that any one flavor didn't overpower the meal.  It went great with the glass of Zin.....which had a nice Chocolate-Berry flavor with a slight Peppery bite to it....yum!Overall, it was really good dinner.  Can't wait to come back and take The Better Half.Return Factor - 95%No where near as good as the one on 40th and Camelback.  And the seating, it is so horrible, for gods sakes, get some more comfortable chairs.  I work my ass off to be in shape, so I don't have enough cushion for those hard chairs.  We had our moms night out there last Saturday and my hubby offered to drive me, so I told him to pick me up after two hours.  He told me I could stay longer,  I told him, no way, my butt couldn't take it any more, I went to the chiropractor on Monday, I still have such a back ache from those horrible, horrible chairs.  Stepping down from the soap box, the pizza piece I tasted from my friend was ok, and my other friend barely ate her muscles.  The Milano Mule was good, but didn't numb my back pain enough.Found this place on Yelp (of course) and my husband I came here for lunch.  We sat outside on a beautiful not so hot day.  We had great service and delicious food.  We ordered the following:Grilled Cauliflower ($10).  So good, I'm not a fan of cauliflower but I will make this dish an exception.  It also had grilled asparagus, toasted breadcrumbs (next time no breadcrumbs, it took away the flavor of the dish), pancetta cream, lemon and a fried egg.  This was a great dish!The Pig Pizza ($15) - With all the cured meats, it made the pizza very salty.  It was still really good but I will do without it next time. Heirloom Beet Salad ($11) -  I love beets and this is a delicious salad.  It also had apples, hazelnut, cheese and lemon crème fraiche.  Delicious!Bolognese ($16)- Excellent!!!  Full of flavor, I can eat this all day!I will definitely go back!A friend of mine recommended North, and it did not disappoint. Cool vibe & great ambiance. We started with their "signature" appetizer, the "Zuc chips" ( deep fried zucchini chips ). They were thin, delicate and delicious. I hade the Kale salad, which was packed with tasty and healthy ingredients. My wife had the "Simple salad", she said it was "simply" delicious. She particularly enjoyed the inclusion of toasted pine nuts. My main course was the Rosemary chicken. It was perfectly prepared, moist, tender and very tasty. My wife had pan seared scallops, which she thoroughly enjoyed.Service was great, our waiter was attentive without being obtrusive, he answered all our questions and helped with insightful suggestions to help us make our delicious decisions.We'll definitely make North a regular stop on any future trips to Scottsdale.North has a number of locations in Arizona and Texas.I just had dinner at the Kierland location in North Scottsdale.Kierland is a beautiful mall and North is very pretty. (see pics) There is an impressive bar, two dining rooms and a cozy patio that is heated for comfortable outside dining in the winter.The menu includes appetizers/small plates, salads, pastas & mains.

Unfortunately, all the effort to make a great environment and fantastic menu ALWAYS gets over shadowed by poor service and thus the 4 stars instead of 5.Parking is limited. Parking garage is near by.

Worst dining experience in 2009 for me.  Where do I start?1.  Sat at a table that had menus and silverware, but was obviously not wiped down.2.  They can't decide who our server is, 5 mins, 6 mins, 7 mins go by... and right at about 10 mins. someone is our server.3.  Menu says Sam Adams on draft.  Turns out, after a long wait, there is no Sam Adams on tap and we order again.4.  Potato chips were delayed because they did not have any pre-made chips.  They arrived with the main meal.5.  Kitchen staff was joking around, girls screaming, almost as if it was a little Spring Break party inside and everyone could hear them.6.  Calzone was ice cold in the middle.  Frozen ricotta cheese?7.  Pizza was burnt on the top.  No, you're not supposed to have those black circular splotches on the cheese.8.  Just a few casual apologies from the teenage waiter for the above.  No manager apology, no "comped" items, nothing.This place seems like it was transplanted from some dopey college campus where every customer is 21 or under and just comes here to get drunk, regardless of food quality, service, and the time it takes to get food.Native New Yorker is a failure.  I regret not taking the other Yelp reviews more seriously, since NNY has a clear trend towards the low end of things, at this location and on Bell.Came in here before and wasn't greeted by anyone. Felt like a morgue. I've been to the native in Tempe and enjoyed it, this one not so much. After no hostess or server came around for a few minutes we ended up walking out the door. Oh well guess I'll stick to the Tempe location.

I love to dine at Claim Jumpers; in other cities but the Bay Area. For some apparent reason- the foods and drinks taste a lot better, the service is more professionally efficient and the restaurants are a lot nicer from other CJ's locations than the Fremont and Concord, CA locations. Maybe it's me, I don't know!This Claim Jumper is located (dead-center) in the outdoor Town Square shopping complexAs a high-volume eater, I love the amount of food offers to us. I also love the lunch items at Claim Jumper including the appetizers and the French Onion Soup. That hearty soup is also a pretty good size too.For lunch, I had a pair of one of  my personal favorites; the Caesar Salad and Chicken Fingers. The $10.95 poultry dish has five boneless breast battered to a golden brown. I also get a choice of dipping sauce, in which I chose the Bleu Cheese.  And the $6.95 Caesar Salad was tasty with salad dressing and the colorful green color of the Romaine lettuce. My salad: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg?select=DB-rVyekCYtrN03DP04YOgMy chicken fingers: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg?select=J5I8LRVYbemBdph4mHJdNAI also had a glass of Arnold Palmer (1/2 Lemonade & 1/2 Iced Tea) with free refills too. What a refreshing way to beat the desert heat!My drink:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg?select=rdK6ulY-Eutca40HxQs8LQWhile my food were being prepared, complimentary dish of buttery popcorn were serve. I can smell even the popcorn popper all over the facility. The popcorn also tasted good in my salad too. You should try that/ Popcorn: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg?select=xBfvl0agZUXeadGhxsSmOwI had a great seat in a booth right across from the bar where I can watch ESPN and CNN on the TV at the bar. Also Ernesto, the hustling bartender/waiter, took my order and serving my needs.

Indeed, my appetite was like a wolf.  My experience from this location is a positive one.  The only downfall is that the dessert case is smaller than the other locations. Just the perfect size to display the monsterous "Motherlode Cake."I just had dinner with a group friends, and with all of us being as original as we are, we all decided to be cheap and get the 4.75 california quesadilla. Little did we know, we all asked for chicken, and when the bill came for the table, we were all charged 11.95 for the chicken quesadilla! How were we supposed to know?! Our waiter was the nicest guy in the world, but he gave us little tips on what foods to choose.Customer service wise, great people who love to help, but you would have to ask! Come to this restaurant with an extremely empty stomach because two people can share one plate it seems!

On the 3500 block of Saint Laurent there is a host of nice restaurants, almost all with white tablecloths and candle lights, surrounding the trendy Complex Ex Centris shopping and cinema mall. At first glance, the Shed Cafe fits the bill, with its red lighted sign. But then you realize that the tables have no cloths, and there are large plasma TVs on overhead, with mostly groups of casually dressed men inside. This is Montreal's version of a sports bar!In this wine and hockey crazed town, where else can you go and watch Monday Night American Football? You may have to settle for Molson, or maybe Stella beer, or god forbid, a glass of French wine, but you can get your football fix! And perhaps better food than Hooters!Mais, Il n'est pas du lipstick sur le cochon!(excuse my French! I can't remember what I learned in High School!)Rough translation: But, No pigs with lipstick on them!There may be male chauvinist pigs present watching the game, but no pigs wearing lipstick! (Even though there is MAC lipstick store 3 doors down!)Come here for some food and drinks, and sports. On nice days, sit out on the sidewalk cafe tables and Shed a few.

Red Thai is on the St. Laurent corridor, filled with little, nice restaurants. Red Thai has a cozy, romantic decor, with purple velvet drapes inside Thai Palace carved alcoves separated by wood carvings of kneeling Thai statues with prayer beads, appearing to hold up the columns. The theatre track lighting with orange gels creates a nice mood, and the opposite side has a full wall smoked mirror to give the illusion of space. Nice Bamboo, Hawaiian Ginger and Orchids adorn the entry. The tables are clothed and have little plastic, pink lotus flowers in a glass bowl, with mood candlelights on every table. Sultry Diana Krall sings alluring jazz numbers and fingers her keyboard over the stereo system. The service is timely, polite and on point. The dishes themselves are elegant, in blue and white decorated porcelain, and shaped like a duck, a leaf, etc. The food is great. Try the Plamur, which are two calamari body halves, grilled, and sprinkled with sesame seeds, and dipped in a Thai sweet/spicy sauce. Follow the Plamur with a Gai Kang Kiew, a green chili chicken curry, with spicey red pepper slices, but not overdone with coconut milk, well seasoned and cooked just right, over your white jasmine rice. They don't have Singha Thai beer, but they do have a good wine list and hard to find Hue Beer, from Central Vietnam, or Sapporo from Japan. Bring your date here and have a romantic evening, with good food, good service, beautiful surroundings, and Dianna Krall to get you in the mood.

This is College of Southern Nevada's Hospitality/Culinary Dept's restaurant.  The front of the house staff are students in the school's Restaurant Management class.  The food are prepared by Culinary Arts students in one of the Culinary Department's restaurant classes (e.g., Aromatics, French, International), with menu changing daily during the weeks that the instructional restaurant is open.This is a sample menu prepared by students in the Aromatics class from 10-14-2008:Choice of Soups or SaladsButternut Squash Soup with Garam Masala or Wild Rice Soup with Fresh Marjoram, Seasonal Mixed Greens with choice of Maytag Blue Cheese Dressing, Apple-Walnut Vinaigrette, or Asian-Orange Vinaigrette.Choice of Entrées:Grilled Marinated Ahi Tuna served with Fried Wasabi Potato Cakes and Hot and Spicy Eggplant with toasted Sesame Seeds.Linguine tossed in White Clam Sauce with Littleneck Clams and Fresh Oregano.Curried Lamb and Vegetable Stew served over Cous-Cous with Mint Chiffonade.One of 3 Dessert selections prepared by Pastry Students in the program.All meals include Homemade Bread or Rolls prepared by CSN Culinary Arts Students under the direction of Master Pastry Chef/Professor Rudi Eichler and Pastry Chef/Instructor Ms. Jody Lee.Price $7.95 (tax included, tips goes toward CSN Scholarship fund)North Las Vegas is far for most ppl, especially with the freeway and road constructions currently causing havoc on Las Vegas roads, but if you are in the area it is well worth the drive.  The dessert that is served alone can cost $7+ in a typical restaurant with its own Pastry Chef.  This is literally the best deal in town when the school is in session.

I used to fly through CLT all the time and was pleasantly reminded why I didn't mind spending a couple hours here on my travel days. The reason is this BBQ spot. Its quick because its done fast food style in the food court but the food is delicious. Probably the only place in here with a line because people literally search it out.I get the same thing every time - pulled pork sandwich with mac n cheese and a fried pickle on the side (comes with it). The pork has tons of flavor before you even put sauce on it and their sauce adds that much more. It's not my favorite style of BBQ sauce but no complaints by any means.I think the fried pickle is my favorite part. Every time I get fried pickles they are done as chips but this place throws in a battered pickle spear with your meal. I need to look for more places that do them like this.If you're in an airport with terrible options this place is a savior.Memphis. St. Louis. Kansas City. Barbecue capitals of America. You should include Charlotte, as we know 'cue here in this town and don't y'all forget it. So when you're changing planes here our very fine Queen City airport, stop in the main atrium (between the B and C concourses) and get yourself a plate of barbecue.Yep, there's a line. Yep, it's totally worth it.I got the pulled pork sandwich, which comes with one side. Mac & cheese is it. And of course, a fried pickle spear. You Yankees who ain't never had a fried pickle? Try it, you might like it.They'll offer to put barbecue sauce on the meat. Your answer here is "Yes, please."At the register, grab one of those locally brewed beers that you probably won't find elsewhere. OMB ("Olde Mecklenburg Brewery") or NoDa or a Carolina Blonde from Carolina Brewery up in Mooresville. Maybe a little cup of banana pudding too.And find a place to sit. In this instance, I don't recommend the rocking chairs as it's potentially messy food and you don't want to wear it.Pick up your sandwich and dig in. If it's like mine, it's tender and juicy and tangy and delicious. Mmmmm... that's barbecue. Welcome to Charlotte. Enjoy your stay!

Me and my wife went to san felipes cantina in Tempe AZ Saturday 6/28/08 they wouldnt let me in becouse I have my daughters name tattoo on my neck, they said just that day management told the workers not to let people in with tattoos above there shoulders. So becouse if this kind of stereotype or racism I rate san felipes cantina in Tempe AZ zero stars. And the worst bar in AZThe food is pretty much inedible. After dark it turns into a hot, sweaty, ugly, trashy dance fest of scary people...who want to fight...or worse yet...fuck.Two stars because it is possible to day drink here and survive. But for the love of god as soon as the sun goes down run. RUN!Worst experience ever at a bar... My friend and I stopped by after grabbing lunch elsewhere in the marketplace. We had just order our first beer and started talking to a couple at the bar next to us. The guy jokingly attached 4 straws together and was trying to drink out of his dates cup. The bartender grabbed the straws, pulled them apart and threw them away without making any eye contact with any of us. Shocked, we told her she was very rude, and that it was completely uncalled for. She immediately cut all four of us off and told us to leave. We asked for the manager, who was in his early thirties, overweight and a complete underachieving nerd named Ryan. He said he stands behind his waitresses regardless of what happened. I told him I would ruin him on yelp and he replied, "yelp is worthless, nobody reads it anyway." Other than that, the bottled beer tasted fresh.We decides to check out San Felipe's to satisfy a fish taco craving. It always looked pretty busy having walked by on other occasions.  Since we were planning on seeing a movie, it seemed convenient.We should've followed our instincts and turned around when we saw the skankily dressed and over made up waitresses smoking outside the back door.We were given the option of inside, bar, or outside. We opted for outside, and loved the cell call service for when the table was ready. There was no mention or indication of there being a band on the patio.   The hostess put us on the same side of a sticky picnic table. We had to move a couple of smokers who were sitting on top of the table before we could sit down. Note, WE had to,the hostess did not. At that point we realized a band was about to start playing.  Luckily we were able to get prices and place a drink order before the screeching started.The drinks and our appetizer of chips and salsa came quickly, but our waters did not.  The music was so loud we couldn't even focus on reading the menu.  We asked to be moved inside, and the waitress obliged. The hostess (also the manager?) came out to move us, and made it clear in her facial expressions that we were severely inconveniencing her. She took us inside, and I caught her rolling her eyes at a waitress as she re-seated us. About 15 minutes later, we finally had a waitress approach us. During this time we had discussed dropping some money on the table and leaving, but we were too hungry and figured the experience could only get better from here.  We couldn't have been more wrong.First request, the water we hadn't gotten yet.  We immediately placed our order, and it came out about 10 minutes later.  It was dropped by a surly food runner with zero personality. Water?  Still missing.  I was stuck sipping my weak margarita and by boyfriend had nearly finished his beer.When we were halfway done with our lukewarm meals, the waitress came to check on us.  Was she carrying water?  Nope.  Finally she followed through on something and brought them.During this time we were subjected to the horrible music coming in from outside.  I'm fairly certain the band's singer was both tone deaf and unable to keep a beat.  I have heard better music at last call in a backwoods karaoke bar.The baja sauce was disgusting. It's basically watered down mayo with a little hot sauce mixed in.  I should've taken to heart their sign that said "if  the food doesn't meet your standards, lower your standards."Well, we finished our meal and waited for our check....for nearly 25 minutes. Between the bad music, bad food, and bad service, we nearly left without paying. Its clear nobody would've noticed.  Since we have manners, I got up and asked the 4 waitresses standing around at the entry for our check, since our's was MIA. They scurried off, and I assumed they were finding her.  After ANOTHER 10 minutes, she finally showed up with the check. AND she had the nerve to say "see you guys next time!" Never again.  Save your time, save your money, save your ear drums. Avoid San Felipe's Cantina.

For some reason I'm on a Fatburger kick lately.  I was in the area, so I stopped by and ordered a Large Fatburger with Cheese and Skinny Fries. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5jTmjxb1X34EfcY1gos4tw?select=GHXXu6KUhAB1WgvXVovFBghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5jTmjxb1X34EfcY1gos4tw?select=nuXk9K_k26TXuwTqscisEAI like this location because the restaurant is always clean and there are plenty of seats and tables.The food took a while to come out.....it's Fatburger after all.  The Fatburger was very good, as usual, and the Fries were cooked just right.  I couldn't finish the order of Fries, next time I'll pass.  Solid 4 Stars ()Return Factor - 90%

Review Text :
8/20This grocery-slash-eatery reminds me more of Cafe Istanbul in terms of its lighter traffic than that of Haji-Baba's eatery and market.  Some of the items on the shelves had a light blanket of dust...Ordered the beef kabob (2 pcs.) platter, with lettuce, onions, hummus, and two pitas.  The kabobs were tasty, even though they were slightly overdone in temperature.  Liked the pitas, disliked the hummus.  I couldn't taste any flavors from the chickpeas, tahini, or spices.  Just that of an oil I couldn't even place its origin.  As I was finishing up the kabobs and pita, I spied two young men enjoying their beef shawarmas, so I ordered one to-go.  Got into my car and couldn't wait to have a bite...  I should've gone with my first choice (of beef shawarma)- this was a very tasty selection.  I'd come back to order it again.I also enjoyed a Lebanese baked dessert, almost cake-like, with two distinct layers- slightly sweet cheese, reminiscent of dried-out ricotta and cream cheese, on the bottom and golden-orange wheat (semolina?), topped with crushed pistachios.  A side sauce dish of simple syrup accompanied the dessert.  I had asked the woman behind the counter two times what the dish was called, and she didn't sound too confident in telling me that she knew it as "shmeer."  (It's the closest thing I could decipher.  Perhaps "shmeed" might be a better word... can anyone help me?)  The ff. is the closest image I found to what I think I had.  (If so, then my dessert was missing the ashtar topping, a type of clotted cream, pictured below.)  The dessert I bought doesn't even come close to approaching the wow factor of this link's image... Kanefe/Knefeh.http://grabyourfork.blogspot.com/2007/08/rabeih-sweets-punchbowl.htmlAfter Yelp Office Hours on Tuesday (Thanks Again Gabi! :-), Mr. K, Brian S and I decided that we needed lunch...were to go?...were...to...go?We were sort of in the neighborhood of Al-Hana, (OK, not really, but close enough) and it won out over some of the other suggestions...and I'm glad it did:)We all like discovering new places and this little spot takes some discovering:)If you don't know that it's inside Baiz market, you will never discover Al-Hana...and that would be a shame:)Much like the cafe at Ranch Market (just up the street) this little cafe is a genuine delight embedded in this small grocery market (with, apparently, no end of interesting food items and sundries in its aisles:)One of the more interesting things I noted, during our visit, was the sizable inventory of hookah's, under lock and key, in the front of the store:)They must have 50 of these things in stock!I'm not a hookah marketing expert, but if asked about inventory management of hookah's, I would have said "hold on there, Earl, I think 3 or 4 hookah's in stock is plenty" :-)So, imagine my surprise and delight, when, during a one hour lunch, I saw 2 of these water pipes walk out the door, accompanied by all sorts of tobacco cans, and other paraphenalia:)And, these hookah's aren't cheap...sticker price looks to be around $200 for the low end models (I really can't tell high end from low end, with hookah's...I'm just going with size as the differentiator:-)What is cheap at Al-Hana/Baiz is lunch...cheap and delightful:)I had Chicken Shawarma and fries (I know...intriguing combo:)...quite tasty:)I got a chance to sample Brian's Hummus and Babaghannuj and I looked over the menu for future visits...because there will be future visits:)The menu includes kabob's, whole roasted chickens, delightful little meat pies ($.69 each...wow!:), and whole host of middle eastern delights...and fries:)And last, but not least, the staff at Al-Hana is so friendly, smiling and eager to please:)It's a stark contrast to the places that think it's enough to just take your order and toss your food at you...the nice people that took care of me just didn't stop smiling the entire time I was there...and I didn't even have spinach in my teeth...this time:)Half-way between Roosevelt and Van Buren on 20th St.It's worth making the trip:)"Do you like Middle Eastern food?" This question started my impromptu tour of Cool Places I Didn't Know Existed in Phoenix.  Uh, wait... where are we?  A grocery store?  I like it!Al-Hana is located within Baiz Market - if you didn't know that, you would probably never find it.  Walking inside, I was immediately taken with the scent of exotic spices, and the interesting combination of hookahs and religious artwork for sale.  I could have spent way longer lingering in the aisles - they have items that I haven't seen elsewhere, and at very reasonable prices.    The dining area is a simple order-at-the-counter setup, with a small collection of tables and chairs.  It is easy to see that everything is made fresh on-site, since the brick oven is right behind the counter and you can watch the goodness happen.  Ooohhh... the food...  babaghannuj with fresh pita, chicken shawarma, and adorable meat pies.  Oh yes!  The more I ate, the happier I was.  By the end, I was smiling and waving at the guys working the brick oven.  You are awesome!  Oh, and the whole table full of delights was only $12...  Too bad I ran out of stomach real estate (and was actually stuffed for the rest of the day) - so many other things I want to try and buy...  little pies that look like pizza... baklava (OK, actually the entire dessert case in the back of the store)... and the cheese, glorious cheese!This makes me wonder, what other hidden gems are out there, waiting to be found?I'm writing this update on Al-Hana to let everyone know they've made some changes recently and for the BEST! The Baiz Market is pretty much the same.  It's a wonderful Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food market and THE BEST place to buy olives, oils, middle eastern spices and pita bread!!  2 for $1and it's fresh daily! Al-Hana~ "take a deep inhale as you enter the Baiz market, awe...." It's the same wonderful aroma and quality of food but they've made some changes to their menu.  Yes, that's right I said menu.  They have menu's now!  They are nicely done with full color pics of most dishes so no more guessing and no need for an interrupter!Their dishes have changed.  They've added rice to most of their dishes at no extra charge. In fact they lowered their prices on a lot of things and changed up a lot of their entries to include rice, hummus and garlic sauce! The chicken and beef schawarma are both some of the best in town but I prefer the Shish Taook ~ two huge skewers of grilled to perfection chicken seasoned in taook spices on top of a large bed of seasoned and delicious rice served with hummus, mixed pickles, tomatoes and their garlic sauce.  It is a HUMONGOUS plate full of tasty goodness that comes with two fresh pitas on top.  It's enough food for two people, people!  So be ready to share.  Their garlic sauce and hummus are as good or better than anyone else's their Shish Taook will leave you wanting!I also recommend getting some of their small meat, cheese or cheese with spinach pies, the small square ones that are folded, heated for an appetizer and share a plate of hummus.  Their small pies are full of flavor and the pie dough is awesome!! Plan to par-ooze the market while you wait for your food.  Skip the pepsi coolers near the Al-Hana counter for your beverage and pick a beverage from the large coolers on the first aisle leading back to the produce.  This is where you'll find just about anything and everything from the middle east to drink.  Yes!They still have the same wonderful team of two guys cooking and the young lady running 100 MPH taking orders and serving everyone all at once.  They have made some fantastic changes and they one of THE BEST places to go for your Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food fixes.  I hope to see you there!Oh my!!  Not only was this some of the best Middle Eastern food I've had in Phoenix, but it's rates right up there with some the best food ever!  And for cheap!  Met up here for lunch today with Rand H, Mike C and Arlin B and even though it's in a crappy part of town, it was well worth it.  We started with some of the little pies, we had the meat, and the spinah/cheese.  Different than other pies I have had at Middle Eastern places, these were made with a tasty dough instead of the layered sheets of whatever they use.  The fillings were seasoned and fantastic, so good I bought a dozen to take home!  99cents for one, 8.99 a dozen, how can you beat that price?! We also all shared a plate of hummus that was delicious, creamy and tasted like hummus should.  For my meal I ordered the beef shawerma plate, but was already full from the other goodies I brought most of it home.  While the meat looked like it was burnt, it was nothing but tender and seasoned just right.  Oh...and everything came with what seemed a stack of fresh made pitas!  Hours later I'm still in that happy food coma place and I'm already planning my next visit.I used to love you, Al-Hana.  I have fond memories of enjoying good food and good company while sitting at your little wobbly tables and chairs.  I fell in love with your babaghannuj.  Yes, you had a lot going for you.I was disappointed, but kept coming back, when you decided to raise the price on Every Single Item I Like, while making all of the portions smaller.  I understood that you have to pay for those new glossy menus with the pretty pictures somehow even though I liked the old menu board with the plastic letters just fine, thanks.  I settled for slow and sometimes surly service from your staff.  Why?  Because I loved you. Well, I think our one-sided relationship has come to an end.  That last visit - you know, the one where you gave our food to another customer (uh, you were confused?), and left us waiting for over 35 minutes without an apology while fulfilling orders for people who arrived and ordered much much later?  That will be my last one.  I especially will cherish the charming way in which the 'manager' grudgingly provided a refund for the food I never received.  "Do you want to return the water as well?"  Um, no.  Since I had to get it out of the cooler myself, I actually received that portion of what I ordered.  Thanks.Keep your rising prices and shrinking portions.  You are no longer worth my affection.----------------CASH Preferred.  Credit Card -- $10 minimum---------------This is important if you're a single as most things on the menu are less than $10.     This place does not have filtered water or even water from a tap.  So, don't forget to grab your drink and pay for it with your food.  I didn't realize I could not get a cup of water when I ordered/paid for my food, so I ended up drinking a bottle of warm water in my car when I was done eating.  Meh.This restaurant is down a street I would never drive down.  Most people would probably never pass this store in their commute to any place in the Valley.  The restaurant itself is located inside of a middle eastern (maybe Islamic/Kosher/?? as there are no pork products in this store) grocery store.  You will not see the name "Al-Hana" on the outside when you drive up, so don't be confused.I had lunch here last week with the Yelper lunch UYE group with Rand H. I tried their chicken schwarma and the fatoosh.  Both tasted very good to me.  I thought the chicken was over cooked, but the flavor was still there and exceptionally good.  The fun part about eating here is exploring the grocery store and standing out like a sore thumb.  I loved checking out all the products.  The herbs and spices you find in whole foods for astronomical prices are not so expensive in there.I would love to go back and try this place, when I have cash on me.  I hope the 2nd time is the charm!----------------CASH Preferred.  Credit Card -- $10 minimum---------------

I have never had the sushi here, my review is based only on my Korean food experience at Maru.It doesn't compare to Mom's cooking, but it definitely satisfies my Korean food craving on those nights when Chinatown is just too far. The interior is very nice and always clean when I have been here. I usually order:-pajun (kimchi pancake)-seafood soondubu (spicy tofu soup)-dolsot bibimbap (hot stone bibimbap)Servers are friendly and the food is consistent. Banchan has been fresh everytime as well. Until there are more Korean options in Summerlin I will definitely continue to come to Maru, and even then, keep it in my rotation.

Review Text :
Essence of Thai is pretty decent Thai food despite the fact that they have Crap Rangoon with imitation crap listed as an appetizer.I brought a coworker here while we were in Las Vegas on a business trip.  He had never had Thai food and his first experience he opened the menu and spotted the Crap Rangoon straightaway.That made for some barely controlled guffawing.  Nice.  So this is the food you wanted to introduce me to?Moving on, we shared some chicken satay.  It was very good with a mild bite and great yellow curry flavor.  I ordered the panang curry and my coworker ordered a beef stir fry sort of thing.  He reported it was good with no signs of crap.The panang curry was nice.  I ordered it 5 out of 10 on the spiciness scale since I had never eaten here before.  I would go more like 7 or 8 if you like it hot.  The dish was very good.  The shrimp were tender and juicy, not sproingy and overdone as sometimes happens.I also had a Thai iced tea which was yummy although not as strongly flavored as most Thai restaurants version.Overall, I would dine at Essence of Thai again.  Skip the crap though.

Remember the movie Brokedown Palace with Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale? And all of the Thai people were so mean to them. Oh. It has nothing to do with this review. I was just asking if you remembered that movie. Anyway, you won't find mean Thai people here. It's definitely a team  effort here and everyone was very helpful and most friendly. Seating is rather awkward as their isn't any signage indicating what to do, wait or sit. Or order inside. But I was quickly invited to sit wherever. Before I knew it a cold, crisp, simple salad and a menu was place in front of me. Yay! Free salad. The dressing was SO good. I bet Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes didn't get free salad. Course they were too busy being pistol whipped by the prison guards. Anyhoo...I ordered the pad thai and it was fantastic. Though I would have loved more tofu. It came with the cutest little spring and a wedge of cold watermelon. YUM! Love watermelon as it so refreshing. All this for around eight bucks. I bet you Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes...oh...never mind. Just get your butt to Thai Basil. Where you will be greeted warmly, served efficiently and probably, won't get pistol whipped by a lesbian Thai prison guard.I love ordering their food Thai-Hot (thats the hottest you can get here). If you like you're food spicy, you can't go wrong. Their pre-meal salads; which come with every dine-in meal, has an awesome salad dressing. They also sell their salad dressing for ($5) to take home. I forget how many oz. they said it was. I think its close to 12 or 16, but don't quote me on it. Every meal seems to come with a slice of fresh cut watermellon.  The watermellon is a nice refreshing pre or post meal snack and also light on the added calories; although the rest of the meal may not be.My favorite dish is their garlic dish; either rice or noodle, ive had it with chicken and tofu before. The tofu is prepared in such a way that it has a crispy outside and a buttery inside. I don't think that I've ever ordered a tofu dish before and thought "I might order this again some time." Their lunch meals will cost you about $10-$11 after tax + tip, so I don't visit all the time, but they are a great choice if you can't stop thinking about thai food and you're in the midtown area near central ave and thomas.

Nice atmosphere, but TFC (The Filipino Channel) on the tube set on VERY LOUD quickly ruins the good vibes for me.  I start to wonder what the non-Filipino customers think of the shows' quality, but then I recall Judge Judy, Montel, COPS, etc., that air on TV and I don't feel so embarrassed.Food are set out buffet-style or "turo-turo" (you point at the food you want), and I quickly learn that the daily lunch specials' menu printed and displayed on an easel outdoors by the entrance doesn't accurately depict what you're going to find served indoors.  Friday's menu listed a dish that wasn't offered bec. apparently it was served the day before and another dish was offered in its place.  (Why even bother printing out a menu if you're not going to stick to it?  Guess I better call ahead before making the trip from Laveen.)  One dish stood out, and I asked the server if it contained any meat, to w/c he replied just "ginataang kalabasa" (aka squash simmered in coconut milk).  I was starving, and aside from the "bistek" (pan-fried slices of beef steak) and "pritong tilapia at galungong" (fried tilapia and scad), nothing much interested me here.  So for my lunch combo, I chose fried tilapia and rice w/ squash, green beans, and okra simmered in coconut milk for my veggies.  I was having a good time eating my lunch until I noticed that there were shrimp (allergy) in the squash dish... The server apparently was not aware it had meat in it, could not verify if it was shrimp, and had to ask the owner/cook to confirm.  I thought this an unacceptable practice; it's a good thing for him that I am not a vegetarian, and a very good thing for the venue's cook/owner that I am not deathly allergic to shrimp, at least not yet.The owner/cook gladly replaced the squash dish for beef steak (w/c tasted fine, albeit salty and VERY greasy), although my original buffet server was not pleased.  This irked me- what does it matter to him that she replaced a dish bec, he was negligent of the original's ingredients?  Perhaps he felt embarrassed that he couldn't even tell there was shrimp in it, but why show discontent?  Oh, he really made my blood boil!  I'll try to visit again to try other lunch specials and see if the service improves.  Otherwise, I may just spend my money at Jeepney Bistro and Lumpia Factory down the road (where my eardrums won't be tormented by untalented comics on "Wowowee").  I do have one positive thing to say about Gingerroot- its rice was whiter, fluffier, and better in quality than that of Lumpia Factory, w/c was yellowed, drier, and just plain sorry-looking enough for me not to take home to re-hash in "sinangag" (rice fried with garlic... yum!).I do hope that the dinner service and menu are several times' better than that of lunch... Menu prices made me laugh... Gingerroot's ambience definitely places it at the top of the list of all the other Filipino venues in Chandler if you're on a date, but I'd very much dislike the experience if I'm forced to listen and watch TFC and have buffet food at those prices!

Dang! I wanted to be the first to write a review and TWO people beat me to it! This place has great, fresh, healthy food! They day I went, they'd only been open for 4 days and they were a little discombobulated. Serving spoons were nowhere to be found, so the folks working there were trying to use tiny plastic spoons to fill big heaping containers. Their cash register was broken too.But from my first taste of baklava, nothing else mattered but the food. The baklava is luscious. It's some of the best I've ever had. It's not gloopy and not cloyingly sweet. The taste of nuts and honey and flakey pastry all come through.Then I tried their veggie soup. It was nothing fancy, but somehow heart-warming soul food in soup form. The Manoshet White Cheese pita/pizza like thing (fiteer for those who know the language) was outstanding. The pitas are fresh baked every day using organic flour. I could eat the Manoshet 3x/day and it would be a long time before I'd tire of it.The Nazarene Salad was a standout. Cabbage, carrots, sesame seeds and bell pepper in a tasty homemade dressing. I do want to suggest they add a combo plate of salads but as friendly as these folks are, I bet they'd make one just for you even if it isn't on the menu.The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was the atmosphere. I'm not so inclined to eat in and much more inclined to get take out. But the food is some of the best to be found in Vegas.I found Amena thanks to Yelp -- again - (Poly A, your review was terrific and convinced me particularly when comparing your notes on Habib's, that I should give them a shot).   So this Easter Sunday, when I realized I'd not ordered items for a party the next day, I remembered reading the review and headed over -- they were open -- Habib's wasn't.  I explained my situation to Amir -- what a great guy.  He and his niece were thoughtful and caring -- beyond generous.  I think they offered me samples of everything in the place.  And even offered to make items I needed that were not on their menu.   I arranged for pick up the next day at 2:00 (meat, cheese and spinach pies, stuffed grape leaves, falafel, tahini, pita bread, baklava, these round phyllo cookies that were crispy, sticky, sweet and cinnamony and just incredible, as well as little chocolate "quickers").   My staff had made lots of the items we served at the Persian-themed party, but there were some things that were just too hard for them to pull off -- hence the outsourcing.  I've not had tremendous luck finding good reliable sources since we've come to Vegas -- but these folks are the real deal.  And sure enough, yesterday at 2:00 sharp -- they were ready, and proud -- even found Persian music for me to use at the party!  Everything was delicious -- truly spectacular and reasonably priced.Bless the Chef's heart -- he looked exhausted, too.  I know my order was a tall one.  I did learn one thing that I thought was interesting that Poly hadn't mentioned -- the family is from Nazareth.  Amir used to be a local bank branch manager.  Anyone looking for a great lunch -- terrific falafel sandwiches, kebobs, etc -- like Poly said -- on freshly baked pita is in for a treat.  It's also a great spot for a dessert -- or to use them for takeout -- but probably best to get to know them and order in advance.   The shelves do seem a bit bare -- but trust me, engage the owner or the girls in a conversation -- ask him what he likes -- their food couldn't be fresher, or their hearts any bigger -- and when I see a family working this hard in this business with such passion, I can't help but want to spread the word...I stared Death in the face and ordered a falaffel sandwich.I was getting ready to leave Las Vegas. The TV weatherman's map showed the southern half of California being pounded under torrential rain.  The entire length of I15 back to California was colored red, and the forecast was for the storm to peak at 3 pm, exactly when I was supposed to leave for the 5 hour drive home.  The Weather Channel said there would be high wind warnings in effect and mentioned there would be the possibility of tornadoes along the road back to southern California.   Well, I thought, if I'm going to risk my life on the road during this storm, I want to make damn sure I have a decent last meal.  There was no doubt in my mind, I had to have a falaffel sandwich from Amena Bakery.I had just tried the place for the first time the day before, based on Misti Y's excellent review.  Her recommendation was, as the English say, spot on.   Amena's pita bread is heavenly.  Tender and light, but still strong enough to hold a bunch of falaffel patties and fixin's. And as Misti notes, they serve the falaffel sandwiches stuffed at Amena Bakery, none of that bogus folded pita nonsense here!  (hello Daphne's!)  The falaffel patties have a great initial crunch and a flavorful interior.  Absolutely delicious!  Each sandwich is made to order, so the patties are plenty warm when you get them.  When your sandwich is ready, you specify what toppings you want.   Without question, this was the best falaffel sandwich I've had in the last 20 years.So, now, as I was getting ready for my redicuously dangerous trip home, I was faced with that Yelp Profile question: what did I want for my last meal on Earth?  It came down to a Super Taco from La Takiza, or a falaffel sandwich from Amena Bakery.    They are both excellent, and I would have been happy to have either one in my belly when I kicked off.  I ended up picking Amena because there are plenty of taco places where I live, but nowhere to get a great falaffel sandwich.And Amena didn't disappoint!  The woman at the register remembered me from the day before.  She asked if I was going to try something new today.  I really wanted to try the shwarma, but I stuck with the falaffel.  I also purchased a couple baklavas.  I'm not a big baklava fan, but the free sample I got on my first visit was so delicious, I had to have more!  So crunchy and sweet!I can't wait to go back to Amena!  I'll have to go multiple times next time I'm in town because I really want to try the shwarma and other items on the menu, and I can't wait to get another falafflel sandwich. Mikey C says: Thanks for turning me on to Amena Bakery, Misti Y!  I love this place!Vegetarians rejoice! ...and Middle Eastern food fanatics!  This place is great!  I had long been craving sabich (ch pronounced like a hard hhhhhh, other transliterations use sabikh with a K) since the Israeli joint on Fort Apache and Sahara closed down over 3 years ago.  A little birdie told me Amena had sabich, so on a trek from UNLV to Centennial Hills, I stopped here for lunch.Fresh-made pita daily, this place smells good and has a wide variety of menu items including sandwiches with schawarma, falafel, lamb to veggie pies, hummus, lebneh, etc.  I stood in line and looked frantically for sabich on the menu, but it was not there.  However, the staff resassured me that it is available, "off-the-menu."Sabich is essentially a pita stuffed with eggplant, hard boiled egg, and amba (a sour mango spread).  Amena serves it with hummus instead of amba, and then allows you to stuff it with all of the healthy fixins': red cabbage, green cabbage, diced onions with a tomato paste similar to harissa with a hint of spice, cucumber, sliced onions, and pickles.  It was a MOUTHFUL!  The staff set s'chug (hot pepper paste) and tahini bottles on the table.  I also got a Mexican coke to drink.  The sandwich was overfull of deliciousness, endless flavors, crunchy fresh veggies, soft pillowly fresh pita, a variety of beautiful colors, hot and soft eggplant and eggs....drool!  Eating this...probably seemed like food porn to the rowdy group of Israeli guys at the table next to me, chattering away in Hebrew.  I am so coming back here and dragging Eric R. who loves middle eastern food and fresh pita!!!  And for all of the curious readers out there, the word for tasty in Hebrew is "ta-im!"Went to TJ's hungry and instead of picking up some of their prepared food to eat (E Coli outbreak) I decided to check this spot out. At first, the word 'Deli' had me excited for a sammie, but as I got closer I saw other signs for 'Shawarma' & 'Falafel'. Holy excitement. The place itself isn't much with just a few tables strewn about. One side has freshly made pitas lined up on a table and a case serving baked goods. The other side was the 'deli' section serving all sorts of Mediterranean delights. Beef, chicken, lamb shawarma, falafel, lentil soup, homemade hummus, etc..  I scooped up a chicken shawarma plate ($11.99) which came with sides of hummus, a small salad and two pitas. There was certainly a good amount of food for the price and I walked away full. The salad was OK, typical Israeli style with lots of cukes. The chicken was moist, sliced nicely and had that wonderful  shawarma spice to it. The only knock is that it was wayyyyy over salted. Highlight of the dish was the hummus. . Shawarma, earmuffs!.... I knocked back two fantastic pitas in that hummus. So good.  Def stop by if you dig the Mediterranean meats vibe.The food was actually pretty great but their customer service was terrible! Earlier that day I had a coworker bring me lentil soup from this restaurant which was the best I have tried so I decided that I would actually go there for lunch. Upon entering the establishment I did notice there were a handful of people enjoying lunch so I kind of instantly thought it was going to be a great experience and since it was so close to work, I would probably make this a frequent place to eat. That actually would be the farthest thing from the truth!I walked up to the counter and was not acknowledged for several minutes even though the women working behind the counter made eye contact with me several times. I reviewed the menu and decided on the lamb gyro platter and was going to be also getting a side of hummus to go for the girls at work. After a few more minutes a middle eastern couple came in and instantly the lady behind the counter said to them "Hello" and they replied hello back, still nothing was said to me, they started to talk in a language that I did not understand which was no big deal and they all looked at me, so the worker comes up and said "yes what would you like" I placed my order and also added an iced tea and went to have a seat. The couple ordered their food and sat down. 2 other middle eastern guys came in, immediately placed their order, the lady came from behind the counter gave them a hug, seemed friendly here. A white couple came in stood at the counter for exactly 8 minutes, I timed it and was never greeted and then they left without ordering anything. The 2 gentlemen that came in long after me were served their food first, then the couple immediately behind me received their food next which did include stuff that looked to have been cooked longer than lamb gyro meat. It was about 40 minutes after I sat down that I finally received my gyro that was not put together at all, I guess you have to build your own here.  I asked for my drink and she was all "Oh I forgot" then after she dropped it off I asked if there was any way she could bring me silverware and the hummus I ordered?  She laughed came back and literally dropped it on my table!  Nothing to go with the hummus either so I ended up having to go to Trader Joes after I finished my Gyro so that we had something to eat the hummus with.  A few other people came in that were not caucasian and were promptly greeted and served faster than I was.  Although I look caucasian, I am mixed but feel this is the first time someone discriminated against me for being part white! I know that sounds ridiculous but also witnessing the caucasian couple not be acknowledged at all makes me believe that these people really do not want anyone in here that cannot speak their language.As i was leaving I did see the lady behind the counter and say "Thank you, have a nice day" and she just looked away.

Restaurant name  Bourbon Steak

Review Text :
My husband and I chose to kick off the first ever Phoenix Restaurant Week at Bourbon Steak in the beautiful Fairmont Scottsdale Princess.  While the ambiance of the restaurant is somewhat fun, the food and service do not have me running back.The restaurant itself is done in a very modern white theme and its very large.  There are several dining rooms (some that are more tucked away than others as well as a large dining room), a bar/lounge area, and a rather inviting looking patio.  I remarked on the way in that it would make the perfect place for a group dinner- its fun, lively, and can easily accommodate a large party.  (If you are looking for a romantic evening, this probably isn't your spot).  The selection of music is questionable, as we heard a range that went from Jack Johnson to Snow Patrol to the Eagles to 80s.  The service left much to be desired.  We waited entirely too long to place our orders, so much so that the duck fat fries and foccacia had already been brought to the table by the time we did.  (We also waited for water for entirely too long...water should be put on the table moments after we are seated).  Once we had placed our drink orders our two glasses of wine took a bit to get to us.  Our table wasn't properly set (a huge pet peeve of mine in restaurants) and we had to ask our server for plates to enjoy the foccacia and fries.  Throughout the night the service was spotty at best.The duck fat fries were very crunchy, yet very good, according to my husband.  (Being allergic to duck I was not able to enjoy them, but I much appreciated the fact that it was announced they were cooked in duck fat when brought to the table.  But then again most upscale restaurants announce the dish and method of preparation when delivering it).  The foccacia was great.  I selected the heirloom tomato appetizer with Burrata cheese which was lovely, and my husband enjoyed his soup (which he found to be sweet) and his mini grilled cheese.  We were both disappointed with our entrees however.  My husband selected the skirt steak which was fatty and very tough to eat.  I know that is the nature of the cut, however, I have had skirt steak that has literally melted in my mouth.  My prime beef short rib was good, but alas, prime rib is prime rib and when I eat it I always feel as if I'm at a wedding.  We had also ordered a side of their truffled mac and cheese which was perhaps the most disappointing part of the meal.  When I order gourmet mac and cheese I'm doing it because I want to indulge...there was nothing indulgent or decadent about this mac and cheese.  It was practically flavorless actually. Of all the mac and cheese side dishes I have ordered in my life (and trust me, there has been a lot), this was my least favorite.  In fact, we didn't even finish it.  Dessert was delicious, even if my beignets were more like zeppole.  My husband loved the vanilla pot du creme which was caramelized perfectly on top.  His trio of ice creams was unremarkable.The regular menu is a la carte style and was actually more reasonably priced than I had expected.  Although Yelp has it listed as a "dressy" restaurant there were people in jeans there.  (I don't think there are actual "dressy" restaurants in Phoenix....)   Now, yes, this is Restaurant Week and I do understand that sometimes restaurants can be overwhelmed with people.  Bourbon Steak was not full by any means (we were the only people seated in our section for quite some time) and I can't imagine our server had more than 2 other tables.  I also understand that the menu options are being produced en masse.  However, in selecting the menu one would expect a restaurant to choose dishes that they know that they can make en masse and make them well.  Restaurant Week is supposed to entice the customer to come back for more, but I have to say that I don't think the quality of food warrants a second visit anytime soon.Writing this a little late, but we came here during Restaurant Week. We were seated in a small dining area, which felt closed off from the rest of the restaurant. I wasn't a fan of the lighting. I felt like I was in a fitting room. Anyway the service here was great. Our waiter explained both the Restaurant Week menu and their regular menu. They immediately brought us the duck fat fries and 3 dipping sauces. I love them all. The french fries were great. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. This is a great starter. We tried the cauliflower veloute and the beef carpaccio for our appetizers. The carpaccio was ok. It did have too many unnecessary ingredients. The cauliflower veloute however was divine. It was so smooth and creamy. It included a lobster fritter and pieces of apple. I could have had a bucket of this for dinner and have been in heaven. We also received some focaccia bread with out appetizers. It was so warm and buttery. We hadn't even had our actual dinner yet and we were getting full. They certainly give your your monies worth. We both ordered the flat iron and short rib for our entrees. We got a little bit of each, which was just enough since we had quite a few other things to eat on the table. The flat iron steak was juicy and flavorful. The short rib was tender but just not as appealing as the steak. Lastly we shared the mascarpone cheesecake and the beignets with the butterscotch creme. Both were delicious. The beignets came with more than enough creme so we took a bit and layered it on top of the cheesecake. Yum. Nice place for dinner. I love coming to the Princess to lounge and have after dinner drinks. The open air bar with their huge lounge area is a great place to come on a nice night and enjoy our beautiful weather.My husband and I enjoyed dining here on NYE and it was extremely delicious! This restaurant is situated inside the Princess and has a great atmosphere. It's lively and overlooks one of the pools. It's much more open and airy than other steakhouses. The service was excellent and we were treated to five star customer service from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. Once our waiter learned that I was expecting he made sure to only serve me food that was pregnancy approved as well! The only downfall of the night was when we arrived and learned that it was a required prix-fixe meal. We made our reservations several weeks in advance and when we did, they didn't mention the mandatory prix-fixe meal. They called us two days prior to our reservation to confirm and when we spoke with them they still didn't mention the prix-fixe. It wasn't until we were seated on NYE that the waiter placed the menu in front of us and we learned that we didn't have the option to simply order off the menu. This resulted in the meal being much more expensive then we planned and it also limited us from getting to enjoy the items on the menu we would have liked to (I was itching to try the Lobster pot pie). The meal ended up being spectacular and we enjoyed a several hour event with five courses of sublime food, but it would have still been nice to have been warned prior to the meal. However, because this was NYE and a special night out, we looked past the prix-fixe issues and thoroughly enjoyed our night! The meal was fun and delicious and we enjoyed the Princess NYE party after the meal which was free for guests and diners of the restaurant to attend. I would definitely recommend a visit to Bourbon Steak but if it's a holiday, confirm their menu with them first!

Review Text :
"BAM"!Emeril...take that BAM back because this place was not all that.  It was decent, but I expected more from you.We get there around happy  hour and start off with a couple of mojitos and chips & salsa.  The chips & salsa appetizer is HUGE, and for $5...a good deal.  I opt for the pulled pork sandwich (with carnitas) and fried pickles.  Husband gets the burger.  I get the concept of the carnitas in a bbq pulled pork sandwich, but I just wasn't too impressed with it.  The fried pickles on the other hand were phenomenal!  My husbands burger was good, but I wouldn't say it was anything special.  Service at Table 10 was excellent.  Our server was very attentive, and refills were never an issue.  There's better places to eat in Vegas, but if you're staying at The Palazzo and looking for a spot during happy hour...this place will do.  They have tvs around the bar with various sports playing, and I must add the mojitos we had were really good.(3.5 stars)Table 10 is located in The Palazzo and it is one of Emeril Lagasse's Las Vegas restaurants.  The restaurant sits in a little shopping/restaurant area of The Palazzo that is a good distance away from the casino.The decor is eclectic but not over the top.  It is a dark space with mostly dark browns (hardwood floor, high bar stools, half booths, walls, etc.).  There are splashes of color though as well as prominent but not ghastly decoration.  The overhead light fixtures are modern and alternate in color (blues and yellows).  Lots of design throughout the room with patterns in the bar seat cushions and the backs of the booths.  Also, the table tops are decorated in multi-colored tiles.  Some metal decoration too including a wrought iron spiral staircase at the center of the bar, which I think heads to nowhere.The complimentary bread was a brioche roll, which was pretty good.  The crust was not much of a crust--kind of like the crust of a normal dinner roll.  There was a pretty good soft and flavorful brioche center that went well with butter.I started with the Seared Maine Sea Scallops With Crispy Fried Leeks, Lobster Tail And Salsa Provencal.  Las Vegas restaurants tend to be very overpriced, but I felt they actually could have charged more for this dish.  For the price, there was a generous portion of seafood (scallops and lobster).  The quality was great too.  The scallops had a nice caramelized sear with a tender and moist inside (though the scallops were a little gritty).  The lobster was tender and sweet. The fried leeks went great with the seafood.  They were very crisp, but they were not oily or greasy.  Good onion flavor.  The sauce was the base of the plate and it consisted of oil, tomato and olives (the olive flavor was very strong).  The sauce had a little bit of spice to it.  The sauce was not bad though not the best flavor and I did not think it complimented the dish (the seafood stood out fine by itself).My entree was seared tuna on a crispy corn cake over a tomato confit base.  The tuna portion was small (though it was a lunch dish).  The tuna was good.  Nice sear on the outside with a rare center.  The crispy corn cake had a crunchy outside and a sweet corn center.  The tomato confit base was kind of like a warmed up salsa and I was not a big fan of it (the sauce really reminded me of a tomato sauce I had at Xiomara Melrose so maybe this cuisine/style is just not for me).  While the tuna was good and everything was cooked properly, the resulting flavors did not really go together that well.I think my disappointment with both sauces/flavors had a lot to due with how each dish had a flavor/ingredient that stood out too much--olive for the starter and tomato for the entree (and not necessarily the best flavor/representation of those ingredients).  It could just be a matter of preference.  They did use very good quality seafood ingredients so I could see how these dishes might appeal more to others.Service was good.  The waiter was soft-spoken, polite and attentive.  Food came out at a good pace.I have never been to an Emeril Lagasse restaurant before so I do not know how this one stacks up to his other locations.  For lunch, the ingredients they use here are better than some of the other Vegas restaurants serving lunch in the same price range.  There are definitely some positives here and it might be worth trying if you are a fan of Emeril Lagasse (or are curious about his food).I walked here, but I imagine The Palazzo has complimentary valet and self-parking like other major Las Vegas hotels/casinos.I can't believe I waited so long to enjoy a meal here! I came here on Sunday after seeing the huge line at the Grand Lux on Sunday. Apparently they are trying a breakfast buffet which attracted a different vibe than I was going for as I was entertaining my future sister in law... The Vibe at table 10 was perfect! Quiet enough to have a conversation and still considered a casual lunch. Service: Absolutely fabulous. I made sure to let the manager know before I left.  My water glass was never half full and the server made sure I was informed on the Sunday menu special. Food: Hummus was great! The salad was slightly smaller than I expected, but I was still plenty full by the end of the meal. I recommend adding chicken if you are making a meal of it. Dessert: I had tea so it wasn't chocolate cake... but it was great! They have a nice selection of teas. They aren't exactly a vegetarian's paradise, but they have plenty of options.Items Experienced:Warm Rolls with ButterCrab Hush Puppies - Pepper JellyJudith Point Calamari - Preserved Lemon Mayonnaise + Tomato SauceCandied North Country Bacon - Noble Tonic #1Bacon Wrapped Dates - Almond + Goat CheeseLouisiana crab cakes - NOLA remouladeFried Green Tomatoes - Shrimp RemouladeChicken + Andouille Sausage Gumbo - Steamed RicePea Tortellini - Blistered Tomatoes + Smoky Pork BrothTomato Soup - Ricotta CheeseBeet Salad - Pickled beets - roasted beets - pistachio butter - sea salt cracker - goat cheeseNOLA Shrimp Po' Boy - French bread - New Orleans BBQ shrimp - lettuce - tomato - friesChicken Breast Sandwich - ciabatta bun - avocado slices - tomato jam - gem lettuce salad with onion, tomato, & cucumberEmeril's Banana Cream Pie - Chocolate Shavings - Caramel Sauce - Whipped CreamFlourless Chocolate Cake - Lemon - Vanilla Cream - Blood Orange SauceSpice Carrot Cake - orange bourbon sauce - candied pecansWhite Chocolate Malassadas - cinnamon sugar - raspberry saucePeach Hand Pie - crumble topping - vanilla ice creamRaspberry Panna Cotta - salted brittle - chocolate pistachio biscottoHaving visited each of Emeril Legasse's Las Vegas restaurants at least once in the past it was with family in town that lunch was planned at Table 10, and sitting with three local friends involved in marketing the celebrity Chef it was to a grand tasting that our table of eight was treated, a kitchen-in-transition showing the same quality we'd come to expect from the man who made "BAM!" a household phase.Currently in the process of promoting a new chef and as such cooked for by Director of Culinary Operations Sean Roe, it was with conversations and reminiscence of my earliest years of fine dining that menus were perused and drinks were ordered, the eventual decision a carte blanche assortment of eighteen plates with several very high highs and only one or two relatively minor lows.No doubt an underregarded space, the shops above the Palazzo gaming floor more readily known for pricy clothing, burgers, and coal-oven pies, Table 10 suffers a bit of an identity crisis compared to Delmonico or the Fish House, yet with a dynamic menu loaded with bargains plus professional service in a laid-back environment the experience is perhaps best described as 'comfortable,' a similar compliment befitting the food.Beginning the meal with soft buttered rolls that continue a trend of great bread service from other Emeril spots, it was next to several small bites that the menu progressed, the Squid from Judith Point a bit lost in the breading let alone the mayonnaise while hush puppies, candied bacon, and stuffed dates were each well prepared American small-plates starters, the first particularly ample with crustacean that shined when matched to the jelly's sweet heat.Onward to proper appetizers, the daily special soup impressing my Aunt but falling a bit short in complexity for my tastes, better bites were found more Southern-slanted flavors including low-filler crab cakes and fried green tomatoes beneath a duo of tangy remoulades, the spice of Andouille well met by dark roux in a gumbo served atop rice.Offering mostly sandwiches and lighter fare at lunch, the dinner menu dressed up in duck and other hearty meats, it was with a beautiful beet salad that two sandwiches were presented atop NOLA-styled bread, each Po-Boy going over nicely with the family while I attempted to keep tender pea tortellini rich with mascarpone in a smoky broth all to myself.Unembarrassed to request all of the desserts, a second round offered when the world-renowned cream pie and spicy carrot cake were obviously in short supply, suffice it to say that there is always room for sweets in any Legasse restaurant, even the simple peach hand pies and bursting white doughnuts amongst the best in town.Perhaps a 'misunderstood' spot as much as it is underregarded the team at Table 10 is turning out a good product at a fair price for the strip with some of the best desserts in town.  Obviously in a transition phase at the moment it will be interesting to see how the restaurant evolves under the direction of a new toque, a dinner visit in order once the menu is revamped.Items Tasted:Sweet Roll with Salted ButterPraline Candied BaconRoasted Pumpkin Soup with Toasted Pumpkin SeedsNew Orleans BBQ ShrimpVietnamese Pork and Shrimp Spring RollsBahamian-style Redfish Ceviche.Salt Roasted Beet Salad with Pistachio Butter and Cypress Grove Goat CheeseSlow Roasted Wild Salmon with Roasted Creamy CauliflowerBarolo Braised Short Rib with Mascarpone Polenta, Baby Carrots andShaved Black TruffleChocolate Sheba Cake with White Chocolate AnglaiseGraciously invited by One7 Media to meet one of the very few Celebrity Chefs I hold near and dear to my heart it was on a rare Sunday night out that I joined three friends for some true "Event Dining," the launch of 'Essential Emeril' coinciding with the introduction of new Table 10 Chef du cuisine James Richards during an intimate 60ish person private dinner on The Palazzzo's second floor.Greeted by several members of the Lagasse's Las Vegas team, Corporate Executive Chef Sean Roe telling us of the newly innovated Snack Bar just moments after we arrived, it was with Champagne or Punch that the evening began and with several of the Chef's classics featured as butler-served hors d'oeuvres whetting the palatr, a meet-and-greet with Emeril himself transitioned all to the dining room where things got kicked up a notch.Describing his new book as "the closest thing I'll ever do to an autobiography" while presenting each dish with anecdotes showing both humility and his own grinning gusto, it was with greeting from several friendly faces from Delmonico, The New Orleans Fish House, and even Lagasse's Stadium that the meal marched forth and reflecting on his earliest years the Roasted Beet Salad was cool, creamy, and aromatic - a heartiness in tune with cooler weather, and a sign of flavors to come.Telling a tale of Charlie Trotter, the man to whom he dedicated the book, before presenting slow roasted salmon that transcended typical through controlled cooking temperatures that yielded a perfectly flaky filet it must be noted that, although rare to imbibe, each wine was on par to the plate with which it was paired, a 2013 Merlot blend from Ornellaia showing a good deal of oak and acidity to compliment truffled shortribs braised fork-tender in Barolo.Mopping up the rest of the beef's juices and any remaining polenta with a buttery sweet roll it was with a lone dessert that the two-hour meal concluded, and citing an unlikely reference in French legend Pierre Gagnaire the Chocolate Sheba Cake walked a fine line between ganache and mousse-like with shaved nuts adding just a touch of texture alongside creamy pool of Anglaise.Thanked repeatedly by Chefs and Staff for our attendance, the gratitude flowing equally from our side of the plate, it was with a signed copy of the new book that each of us departed after again shaking hands with a true legend, a return visit to check out Chef Richards' menu update already being planned.A good spot for grubbin' on some of Emeril's best. I wouldn't have even known about this place if I hadn't seen a poster advertising their 4 courses for $48 deal in the Venetian elevator. It's a good price for a lot of food, most of it quite good. FIRST COURSEFLAME-ROASTED MARROW BONES: $11 for three giant bones. This was a great start t our meal, with the gelatinous gold spread onto baguette slices and sprinkled with sea salt. (Not part of the 4/$48)ROASTED PUMPKIN SOUP: I assume it's seasonal, and it is damn good. Get it while you can. This soup is surprisingly thick (like potato) yet smooth, with a light, rich flavor. The toasted pumpkin seeds and pumpkin oil added just the right bit of "extra" to keep it from being too simple.CHICKEN + ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE GUMBO: it's not my favorite version, but a passable one for the Strip location. Slightly spicy, surprisingly meaty, and served over soft white rice.SECOND COURSEEMERIL'S BBQ SHRIMP: Overcooked shrimp seemed like it had been sitting out, the NewOrleans barbecue glaze wasn't well-received by others at the table, and the rosemary biscuit had nice flavors but was hard and dry.SMOKEY MUSHROOM PASTA: A surprise hit! Fresh, perfectly al-dente pasta with tasso ham, smoked mushrooms, and parmesan cheese, with a zesty Cajun sauce. I could have done without the ham, and expected slightly more mushrooms given the name of the dish, but was pleasantly surprised by this dish.THIRD COURSE (MAINS)EMERIL'S PORK CHOP: served with caramelized sweet potatoes, which paired perfectly and went perfectly with the colder fall season. This was one of the best pork chops I've had, tender and juicy with plenty of flavor and a great seasoning/glaze. The menu description also mentions a "green chile mole" that I either didn't receive or that simply wasn't distinct from the other flavors on the plate.CARAMELIZED SEA SCALLOPS: Got this over the short rib at the suggestion of our server, and ended up really enjoying it. Light flavors and portion, consisting of 3 large scallops served on a smear (there really should have been more!) of a great cauliflower puree, with a sea of brown butter sauce, accented with raisins, marcona almonds, and capers. This was surprisingly well-balanced, I liked that the capers didn't overpower the other, milder ingredients. I do wish the scallops had a better sear, though.FOURTH COURSE (DESSERTS)BANANAS FOSTER BREAD PUDDING: A decent bread pudding, topped with two lonely slices of banana, with a caramel glaze and more whipped cream and chocolate shavings. A less successful banana-based dessert.EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE: Heavenly. A homemade crust topped with tons of fresh banana, a blanket of smoothly sweet banana cream, and decorated with chocolate curls, caramel sauce, and whipped cream. I would come back for this.Our server, Diana, was great at making suggestions and checking on us without being overbearing. Interior seating is dark and quiet with a date-night atmosphere. Large bar area offers a limited "bar bites" menu, and there is a HH available, but by far the best deal is their 4 course dinner.

I've been eating here since it was still a falafel truck on Bigelow Boulevard.  Top-notch Middle Eastern/Mediterranean entrees.  The "Best Falafel in Pittsburgh" sign is not hyperbole (the falafel is perfectly spiced and fried a lovely golden-brown, and comes stuffed in a pita with sumac, pickle, tahini sauce, and an astonishing chopped salad with lemon in it), but don't let the glory of the falafel dissuade you from trying the gyros, the shwarma, or anything else.  The hummus is also very good -- lots of tahini (which I love), and drizzled with olive oil and homemade chopped pickled hot peppers.  Definitely a tasty treat anytime.Opening the restaurant and getting out of the back of the truck has let the menu expand, and now there are some entrees that it wouldn't be practical to cook and serve in a truck.  I particularly love the moussaka.Assuming you haven't already gorged yourself on hummus, falafel, and other delicious foods, you should also get a piece of baklava for the road.Leena's also has a sort of inspiring backstory.  The owner has had a lot of struggles in his life -- after coming to America, he was hit by a drunken driver and horribly injured years ago, his young daughter lost a hand in a terrible kitchen accident, and the city harassed the Oakland food trucks and basically drove them all out of business for a long time.  But the owner did not give up.  He opened his restaurant after his truck was driven out of business, and he is always so happy and optimistic despite all the obstacles fate has put in his path.  I would not have known about all the terrible things he's surmounted, but the Pitt newspaper ran a story about it when the restaurant opened up a couple years ago.  Leena's Food is a great restaurant, but it also is a physical embodiment of the American Dream, and the owner is one of the quiet heroes you find every day in Pittsburgh.

I am not from Montreal but i have seen the reviews and they weren't so pleasant. I had some suspicion about this restaurant but it was a long day and my mother and i were very hungry and wanted a good early dinner. the outside doesn't seem like it was the best place to eat and once you walked in they had barely any customers. We were greeted by the waiter who seated us very quickly, handed us the menu.. He seemed nice and notice we were Americans and told us if we had any question to just ask. Once we looking over the selection two very strange guys came into the restaurant and i could immediately tell they were on drugs. i think the other people in the restaurant could tell also. Once our waiter seen the worried looks on me and my mothers face he made sure they we would have a pleasant time and catered to us. I ordered the Carbonara ( w/ bacon)  which by some reviews a lot of people didn't enjoy and my mother had Festin Italien ( Spaghetti w/ meatball , sausage and Cheese bread). I enjoyed the Carbonara, it was so delicious, My mother enjoyed her food as well. Even thou those strange people were around us i can't say that it wasn't a good meal. The staff were very professional and handle the situation very well and catered to me and my mother and very well. Hopefully people give this restaurant another chance i believe they deserve it.

Disclaimer: This review might offend you if you aren't Greek and take jokes too seriously. They should call this place The Bad Greek. Actually, maybe the name is a warning... "if you arrive here a happy Greek once you try our terrible food you will leave a Mad Greek".  I don't know who is back there making the food, but the cook should be sent to live with the Turks in Cyprus for being so impressively bad at being Greek. Maybe this place was opened by a Turkish housewife as a passive-aggressive jab at the Greeks. I could sit and do nothing but speculate all day as to how these people got so truly terrible at life, but then I would get hungry eventually, which might cause me to need to eat more of their crappy food.Kidding aside, we Greeks are a very hungry people.  If you are luring starving Greeks to your establishment, the most important thing you should know is that eating is not a joke to us.  So don't burn the freaking spanakopita.  Especially if you didn't even bother to put more than a half teaspoon of filling in it... ESPECIALLY if one of the minuscule four burnt "spinach pie" nibblets doesn't even have the correct filling in it!!!  Did someone drop some jam in there?  Why was it sweet??  And why did the nibblets consist of almost nothing but burnt phyllo dough?!  This I do not like. This is merely a reminder of what could have been.Everything else was mediocre at best...Pre-made cheap Italian dressing on my Anatolia salad that you can't call a "salata" unless you want to confuse them.Dolmades piled sloppily under a sea of bland mystery sauce, loosely rolled as though they were Taco Bell burritos, filled with unvarying smoosh and what appeared to be instant rice.Pre-crumbled feta... WTF?  Are they really so lazy that they cringe at the prospect of clasping their hand a few times to break up some blocks of feta?!None of this should matter to any Greek reading this... Because they had the audacity to serve me badly burnt spanakopita with no filling.  It was like a pastry version of the worst frozen potstickers you've ever eaten.  How dare they!!What they have created in the charliefoxtrot (clusterfffff) that is The Mad Greek is worse than spitting on my food... They have spit on my soul.  Don't mess with hungry Greeks!!!  Not cool.  Every time someone goes here to eat someone's yiayia drops dead... So save a yiayia and don't ever eat here!!!

Review Text :
After three and a half years working with business owners, planning events, trying to connect people to places worth praising, I've learned a lot. Now this is not to say I know everything there is to know about running a small business, I'd be running one if I did. But I do know a couple of things, and I'm about to reveal a million dollar secret that will take any business from bummer to bustling: PEOPLE FIRSTHuge, right? Now what do I mean by this? If you own a small business, you probably do so for several reasons... but your first should be people. You should want to turn on the lights, unlock the doors, welcome members of the community into your space and exchange something for the money patrons are spending at your establishment. People are your business. It might not be the only reason, but it's why you exist.I've been to The Library a few times now and each time I'm there I don't feel like I'm welcome. I understand the place is tiny, it's typically packed with drunk coeds, it's loud, there's little room to maneuver, all of this I understand. But I also understand that it doesn't take much to make people feel like you value their business and you enjoy them experiencing the things that make you so stellar in a hospitable way. The staff that I've encountered is anything but hospitable. I tell business owners, strive for 5, in other words control everything you can control and work to give people five-star experiences. You can't be 100%, 100% of the time, but a smile goes a long way. A thanks for stopping in, come back and see us again goes even farther. I'm not certain what they're striving for at The Library other than closing time, when they can turn the lights off, lock the doors and not have to deal with people until tomorrow.

I happened to be in the area and was hungry so I used the Android Yelp App to search for Sandwich joints in the area.  Found this one and decided to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did.I ordered the Wise Guys Sub (Capocolla, Mortadella, Hard Salami, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Roasted Red Peppers, Pepperoncini Peppers, Provolone, and Basil Mayo) on Ciabatta Bread $6.99, a bag of Jalapeno Chips $.80, and a Bottle of Water $1.99.The food came out within a few minutes.  The size of the Sandwich was just right....not too big and not too small.  I eagerly took a bite and was impressed with the flavor that the Roasted Red Peppers brought to the Sandwich.  I've had a lot of Italian Sandwiches and have never had one with Roasted Red Peppers.....additionally, the Basil Mayo added another element to the Sub which made it very good.  The proportion of Meat and toppings was very good.The only complaint is that with all of that wet stuff in the Sandwich, the ingredients were sliding off the Bread and it took some work to keep it all together.  I didn't dock them any stars for that....it's more of a preference thing.Of course the Sandwich came with a Spicy Pickle.....which I didn't think was too Spicy at all.....nice flavor though.  Would have enjoyed a really Spicy Pickle.....was hoping for one.Will I return?  I live on the other side of town and rarely come to Egypt....but next time I'm near the area, I'll be back.I made my 2nd trip back to Spicy Pickle. I was sure pleased! This time I tried the "Brooklyn" which had Turkey Pastrami, Swiss, Coleslaw, and Thousand Island dressing on rye. It was a panini. It also came with a side of macaroni salad.The sandwich as very tasty. The Coleslaw was crunchy and fresh. The Thousand Island dressing added a nice touch and they weren't shy on it which I liked since I like extra dressing on anything.The macaroni salad was unlike any other I ever had. It maybe had an Italian dressing on it? I'm not sure but it was fresh and tasty. There were crunchy fresh pieces of celery and onion in it. I had my own drink so the meal cost $7.56. I was yet again very pleased and will for sure be back! I think I will try their flat bread pizza next!

Review Text :
I'm as familiar with Ethiopian food as humans' understanding of the mechanics of a singularity. With that prologue, I agreed to try out this place with my friend Adam out of sheer curiosity. This is a casual place with inadequate ventilation so you may smell a little when you leave. Adam suggested that we start with something small and if we like it, we'll order more. What a great idea that was! The vegetable combination platter that we ordered, although seemed small, was so filling that we were stuffed after going through a quarter of it. You get four-five items sitting on top of a bread called injera. There were collard greens, stewed lentils and three different types of stewed peas: a mild version (yellow), a medium spicy version (orange) and a super tangy and spicy version (red). The mild peas and collard greens were sooooooo good! I loved them. I'm not into lentils so I skipped that while the red peas were the strangest thing I've ever tried.  It had such a strong kick to its taste, and did I mention how spicy this particular item was?!! Injera, the bread, came in a basket; a bundle of fluffy spongy goodness for you to tear up and dip into the stewed vegetables. I've never had anything quite like it. It was subtle and strange and yet very much agreeable with my palate! I wouldn't mind coming back here again. What an experience that was!A worthy venue to experience the flavors of Ethiopia. Located conveniently near "The Orleans" resort, drive from The Strip to Tropicana Blvd., turn west, just passed "The Orleans" turn in just before Decatur Blvd. This restaurant is nicely decorated and staffed by very friendly people. A full bar is available. The veggie and meat combination (about $27) should feed a group of three or four. It has a large selection of delicacies and plenty of Injera accompanied.  The menu is very self-explanatory with familiar items such as Gored Gored (raw beef), Awazi Tibs (cooked beef), and vegetarian specialties.Worth a $25 cab ride.Save room for Cafe Latte or Spiced Tea afterward.HORN OF AFRICA DINNERHere for dinner with our Ethiopian friends and successful Henderson business owner Mo and his wife Sally who we have known for many years.Following ingredients are commonly utilized in Ethiopian cookery:Injera: made of a whole grain known as Teff and in the United States is made with Teff and wheat flour.... not easy to make at home.Kibe: Ethiopian purified butter which is well seasoned with several condiments and used in traditional sauteing.Berbere: is made up of many tasty spices like ginger, red pepper, cardamon,  cumin and fenugreek. It's spicy and a key ingredient in Ethiopian cusine...Mitmita: Hot spiced chili powder... it's applied to suit your tolerance and taste. Introduced to landlocked  Ethiopia in the 14th century by Portuguese traders. The name Abyssinia is the country's orginal name given by the British. Their cuisine has been described as "foods of the earth" and some of the oldest recipes known to mankind. Ordered menu item #35  Vegi and Meat Combination. Including aforementioned three items Injera, Kibe and Berbere. INCLUDED VEGI MENU ITEMS as part of COMBO #35:4.  Abyssinia Salad: Special salad with tomato, onion jalapeno, touch of fresh garlic with secret Abyssinia style salad sauce5.  Ater Kik Alicha: Mild yellow split peas cooked with onions, oil and garlic with a touch of tumeric  and subtle blend of herbs and spices6 . Yatakilt Alicha: A delicious vegetable, boiled cabbage, sliced carrots, and simmered with onions, garlic, ginger and vegetable oil7.  Yemisir Wot with Red Pepper: Split red lentils are stewed with onion, garlic and a blend of mild Ethiopian  herb8.  Yemisir Wot with Tumeric: Split lentils are stewed with onion, garlic and a blend of mild Ethiopian herbs9.  Collard Greens: Chopped collard greens simmered in a mild sauce of oil, onion and herbsINCLUDED MEAT MENU ITEMS as part of COMBO #35:12.  Doro (Chicken) Wot: A drumstick or thigh cooked to tenderness in a hot and thick red pepper, onions, garlic, gingered and purified butter sauce. Served with hard boiled egg and home made cheese16.

Yebeg Siga Wot: Spicy tender lamb pieces stew cooked with onion, butter and Ethiopian  herbsORDERED SPECIAL not included in COMBO #35:Special ordered Fish Goulash (center of platter) for this Saturday evening.  Normally this entree is available only on Wednesdays and Fridays from a separate postcard of Specials offered.Yu-go and I were first introduced to this cuisine while we were stationed in the Washington DC area where the Ethiopian community is the largest in America. We have repeated tasting the cuisine in many different parts of America. Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant is equal to the best of the best in Washington DC.UGH! *WHY* did I come here the night before a nude photo shoot?! I knew I wouldn't be able to control myself around this delicious food....and sure enough, I beasted like a little piggie and now I LOOK like a little piggie :-(I don't have much to compare this to -- the only other Ethiopian place I've eaten at is Merkato. The food and service were comparable, but this place has the edge when it comes to ambiance: cozy, cheerfully decorated and homey.A friend and I shared the meat & veggie combo platter for $30 -- something like 10 different scoops of lentils, veggies and meats on a giant piece of injera (spongy sourdough pancake). Plus a basket of injera on the side. Everything was fanTAStic!!!The only downside was, I ate so much injera and it's all puffed up in my belly now. And as mentioned, I have a nude photo shoot in the morning. Thank dog I do all that ab work at the gym...hopefully my abdominal muscles are strong enough to suck it all back in. I will definitely be back here!

Review Text :
I was once an avid supporter of the deliciousness that was being concocted at Zada Janes. But after today I'm sorry I will not be returning. In a laid back atmosphere I am okay with a laid back service style. Today was beyond laid back to the point of lazy and down right nonexistent. The kicker. A friend specifically ordered gluten free pancakes. Having a gluten allergy this seemed to be a no brainer. Half way through the meal the server let's us know that the pancakes are not the gluten free ones and asks. "Do you still want them?" Then proceeds to tell us that someone else can have the rest of her half eaten ones since she wasn't going to finish them. WHAT?! So after a trip to CVS and $20 in medication we will not be returning again. Sorry Zada. This failure can't be recovered from.

Review Text :
Los Cerritos serves up the best California Burrito in the area! The burrito itself is HUGE and stuffed with well-cooked and seasoned carne asada, potatoes, grilled onions, melted cheese, and some herbs and seasoning that make this like no other burrito. All this in a freshly made tortilla for only $4.99! When we have a craving for Mexican food, we'll drive past the several other closer restaurants to visit Los Cerritos because the burritos are that good. I wasn't too impressed with the crunchy shredded beef taco, but the rice and beans were good and the lettuce was fresh. Now, I just stick to the burritos because they know how to make a mean burrito! Like Roland W. and Stephen B. mentioned, sure this place doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't judge until you've tasted the food. The staff here are always friendly and take their time preparing the meal (not just thrown together in 30 seconds in a tortilla like they do at the fast food chains). Los Cerritos is a small casual restaurant that serves up some tasty Mexican food!

I absolutely love the interior of Maria Maria. Upon entry, I'm instantly relaxed, especially when they dim the lights 'round 7:30 p.m. There's a picture hanging near the hostess table that i wish I could snatch off the wall and run away with. I love it! If you see it, it's the picture of a guitar etched upon the back of a female. Lovely!But, what about the grub? Well...First trip here, I sat in the bar area. I ordered their Baked Cheese with chicken, ham and chrizo. It came with warm, thin tortillas. A bit too greasy for me - some would say I should have expected this - but I thought, over all, that it was good. It sat in my belly like a rock, though.My second trip here, my friends and I sat in a "mini lounge" area under one of the huge plasma screens. It was a comfy space that begged to be occupied on an early Friday evening. We each ordered a drink. Sangria for two. Sangria blanco for one. Four Peaks Sunbru for me. Then all 4 of us split the seafood guacamole. Oh yum. If you order anything of the menu, this is a must. The lump jumbo crab meat with shrimp is heavenly. I could have eaten just the warm seafood that comes on top of the guac. In fact, we did ask for just a side of that. Unfortunately, when the check came, we were charged for 2 orders of seafood guac. So, basically we were charged $28 for seafood guac with extra seafood. Go figure. (If I had known, I wouldn't have ordered it on the side.) Three salsas, chips and the seafood guac was hearty enough to satisfy us. For kicks, one friend ordered the plantains. I had a nibble. It was good, though I'm no fan of the creamy white stuff on top. Icky.As for drinks, the Sunbru was just okay. They do have a pretty good drink menu, though. Between beers and wines, I'd be set here any day of the week. They offer 2 different Viogners by the glass! They do have plenty of mixed "specialty" drinks for those who like their hard liquors. If you like coffee, they serve that too. When asked what super strong java they had given me, I was told it was from the brand "Mr. Espresso." And here I thought I may be drinking authentic coffee, for it sure packed a super strong punch!I have to say that while I really, really, really dig the decor and atmosphere, the food has, for two times in a row, made my tummy a little bit upset. I can't put my finger on why it would, but it makes me a little concerned to go back. I think if I do, I'll order the Spinach Mango Salad with Grilled Shrimp, with almonds and raisins. For $13, it better be great! If you're at Tempe Marketplace, check this place out. My friends and I ended up sitting around and chatting for a few hours. Our server was very nice, though towards the end, he got slammed with other patrons and neglected us a bit. It was understandable, since we were basically only there to nosh and drink. *drum roll*Maria Maria gets...4 stars for atmosphere and decor. 4 stars for service.2 stars for food that makes my tummy a tad upset.2 stars for the live music that night. It didn't seem to fit the motif. For a final score of 3 stars, which is a typical "It's worth checking out but don't expect to be blown away" rating. I really wish I could rate this place higher. I want to! But...I just can't.My visit to this place was not only disappointing, but it made me sad to think that this place would probably go the way of Planet Hollywood in a year or two. I had the Carnitas and I had to cut (or should I say SAW) into it with a knife and fork. My friend's crab enchiladas were underwhelming. I was heartbroken that yet another famous Latino is slapping his name on a "brand" that will probably fail instead of actually checking out the food and making sure it's edible. Very beautiful decor, and nice (but not terribly sharp) staff is about the only thing I can say about this one.I wanted to hate this place more than I do, but it's not that bad.   Been here a few times and the food was average to above average.  Drinks were normal, but any specialty drinks or tequilas seemed expensive. The nachos were very good, and different than most places.  I liked the music, and no they don't play much Santana at all.The staff is young and inexperienced, so service is hit or miss.  If I had to hang out at Tempe Marketplace I'd come back here I guess.

I really want to give this place another star but cant as of yet. It is Korean family owned. They are in the process of getting their liqour license so their menu's were a bit confusing. They didnt have the beer pictured on the menu and they were out of or did not have what we really wanted to order from the menu. No fatty tuna etc etc. I suggest either not having those menus out or marking out what is not available. It was a bit confusing. We finally started with the green mussels and crab angels they were ok. Imitation crab eh, the Ikura was good see pics. The kid loves those damn things. The roll we ordered tasted really good but I cant remember the name, it had red snapper on top it came apart easily and their mayonnaise sauce was a little too orange looking compared to what I have seen. The meat eaters seemed to love the dolsot bibimpap with all the little sides. The tuna titaki was different hardly seared at all. I have been here before its a cute little place I love the staff they are super nice. There was tons of people picking up food while we ate. There were also several other diners being served. The best thing about this place is the pictures of all the dishes on the walls I think that is pure genius. The new sign says J.K. Sushi it was also known as The Japanese Bawl not bowl. I agree with Aletheia on this place though, it truly is better than Hana on 7th Ave. http://www.yelp.com/biz/jk-bowl-phoenix I really hope they get their liquor license soon before Ah-So opens up at Norterra.

Review Text :
Pretentious, boring, contradictory.  Their menu totes "freshest ingredients, giving priority to local and seasonal produce, to create surprising flavour combinations and unusual dishes that you won't find anywhere else."  This statement is a stretch by any means, I have been to many vegan and vegetarian restaurants, that have blown my mind with unique and innovative cooking. This is not one of them. Tofu and tempeh burgers are a dime a dozen. As are asian fusion bowls but not with the hefty price tag of 13 to 15 dollars, for a veggy bowl. What is local or seasonal about daikon, dulce or wakame? Let's be honest about what this restaurant truly is; it does not cater to much of the vegan crowd, because most vegans wouldn't pay the inflated prices for things they could easily make at home.  Most vegans and vegetarians have had their share of tofu and tempeh burgers, if not a few hundred veggie bowls. Therefore, lets truthfully admit that this restaurant caters to the curiosity of non vegan and vegetarians offering trendy fare at a price. The staff were rather aloof, and had us standing at the host station for 10 minutes, while looking over a virtually empty restaurant. Furthermore when we were seated by who we thought to be our server, she said nothing to us and walked away from the table after seating. She then returned  with a bottle of water (for 3 of us)filling our glasses with water and walked away. 20 min later our glasses were empty and we were still waiting to order. When we finally made eye contact with one of the other employees behind the juice bar(who was leisurely chatting with other staff behind the bar), the original host/server finally came over and begrudgingly  took our order. After our food arrived our water glasses remained empty ( we think that they only allowed us one bottle of water because they expected us to buy drinks, such as $4.50 for 8oz of juice) and no one came to check on us to see if the food or order was to our satisfaction. To top it off the server had forgotten to bring a bowl of soup, but didn't realize.  Then another sever showed up at the table with soup in hand after we had already finished our meal.  After asking him to pack it to go, he returned with the bill and has the audacity to start chatting us up, almost as thought he was hoping to get a good tip. WTF?!The food was satisfactory, but all in all the place left a bad taste in our mouths and a hole in our wallets.Generous portion, reasonable price and fresh ingredients. I had the buddha bowl (with tofu), which came in a large colorful bowl of veggies and rice.My only small complaint is that I wish he proportion of rice to veggies was more equal, as there was way too much rice and not enough veggies to balance it. However, the sauce was very good and complemented the meal well.   The price point was very reasonable. $11 for the sandwiches and $13-15 for the bowls. I wish i had the room to try their desserts as they looked so so good. Will definitely return to try the sandwiches and chocolate desserts !   P.S. Their menu is extremely extensive, so great place for non-vegan/vegetarians as well.

Restaurant name  English Rose Tea Room

Review Text :
We went back today to try the Duchess of Bedford's Formal Afternoon Tea....truly sumptuous! It is served on a 3 tier stand ..... the presentation is  really amazing : ) We were lucky to get a seat as there were only about 2 tables left on the front patio. It was great to see it so busy as well as to see everyone enjoying their tea and sandwiches!We had to order the Paris Tea once again as we had been craving it since our last visit. The staff as last time were wonderful and we picked up yet another little item at the gift store.Do you feel like taking an afternoon trip to have high tea with the Queen? What's that you say? You can't find time in your day to hop on a plane to the United Kingdom? Well that's quite all right because I have the next best option right in our own desert backyard. I am talking about the one and the only royal experience at the English Rose Tea Room in none other than Cave Creek Arizona. I will just start by saying that the website and pictures don't do this little afternoon tea house any justice. Think of the English Rose Tea Room like the perfect haven for ladies who lunch. The ambiance is fit for a Queen. It's girly, it's cozy and it's adorable, almost like a magical elf's cottage. The woman who runs this tea room is English herself which makes the experience that much more enjoyable. As you walk in, a quaint outdoor patio greets you and once inside, shelves line the walls with every type of tea and tea accessory imaginable. Oh and let's not forget about the Queen herself welcoming you inside (or a cut-out, but we're playing imagination here). Behind the panels lies an intimate tea room where ladies and their guests lunch or have afternoon tea. Hats? Yes there are plenty of hats all around. Did you forget your hat? Well that's ok because there's a basket full ready to be loaned out for the occasion. Moving on to the tea experience itself, well it's really quite charming. The menu ranges from basic lunch items such as quiche, chicken salad sandwiches and salads to afternoon tea items where you can order the entire Afternoon Tea ($24.99 a person) or you can pick and choose from an a la carte menu. Because my Mom and I had waited so long to try the English Rose Tea Room and we went to celebrate her belated birthday, we ordered a feast fit for a Queen. We first started by sharing the half English salad split for two which was a perfectly fresh salad of greens, raspberries, candied pecans and a delicious raspberry vinaigrette. Following our salad, the Afternoon Tea for two appeared in front of our very eyes! This three-tier meal was accompanied by our choice of tea. We decided to go with the apricot and enjoyed every last sip of not one but two pots! The tea was so delicious you don't need sugar or cream either. The three-tier tea included 6 mini sandwiches a piece (2 cucumber, 2 chicken salad & 2 salmon), two very large (and scrumptious) scones topped w/ powdered sugar and many mini desserts to finish off the meal. My favorite items were the chicken salad tea sandwich, the salmon tea sandwich and the scone. The desserts were decent but the scone really stole the sweet-filled show. This is a truly delightful place to spend a lazy afternoon when you have nothing but time. Don't visit expecting to be in and out for a quick lunch. No, tea is meant to be savored and you can absolutely do that at this perfectly tealightful restaurant.Pick out the girliest, most floral covered dress you own and put  it on. Make sure it's pink. Next, double check that you have pink nail polish, lipstick and blush. Ok you're all set.Do you have a mom? Sister? Wife... Daughter... Aunt... Female caregiver...? Are they in the least bit girly and celebrating a birthday or mothers day or divorce or whatever?  This is where you take them.You sip tea and nibble scones all while surrounded by pictures of the royal family, flowers, dogs, kittens, tea cups and other feminine knick-knacks. And of course, the hats. They have a basket of hats available to borrow for your afternoon tea. Some of them are clearly for little girls and are a little beat up, but there are plenty of nice new ones as well.The tea menu is extensive and will satisfy any taste, available in small pots and large. I had the English Rose and it was delightfully light and aromatic. The food offerings allow for both breakfast or lunch with savory and sweet options. And of course save room for the scones. The scones they serve are the highlight. They are served warm with clotted cream and strawberry jam, like in any good English parlor.After you have had your fill of tea and scones, walk over to their little shop next door. In it you will find jewelry and hats, home decor, soaps and fragrances.Quite the lovely experience, indeed!

The first time we tried Lucky's was maybe six years ago. I didn't like it then. Hard to remember what we ordered, perhaps a Sicilian style, but either the crust or sauce or something else turned us off and we decided not to go back. Until a couple of weeks ago, when, having exhausted just about every other food place in Surprise two dozens times over, I came up with the jolly idea of getting us some Lucky's again based on all the good reviews. And I hated it just as much this time around as the first. UGH.The only positive thing I can say about this place is that they give you a ~monstrous~ amount of pizza. Imagine a large pizza box precisely filled with a giant square BRICK of a pizza, easily an inch and a half tall and cut into square slices. That's what we got. I'd say it was over 3 pounds of pizza; flavorless and gross. I found it breathtaking that it had that little taste. This was a supreme pizza that tasted through and through like I was eating play-doh. Olives, sauce, cheese, crust, the works. To top it off, the mushrooms were slimy, canned champignons and not fresh at all, and tasted as though they'd just been pulled out of someone's nose. I've had some pretty bad pizza in my time, most of them I'd liken to eating chewy, dry cardboard. This was the first one that was this big and relatively succulent and STILL tasted gross.I stomached maybe six slices over two sorry-ass sittings before throwing about 2/3 of the pizza away. Two pounds' worth of "food", down the sh1tter. I don't know where the mass delusion about this place comes from, but I'll never return. If I want a gutbuster special, especially now that Bronco Billy's is gone, I'll head to Rays just down the road instead. Plus, Lucky's is overpriced. A large and a smaller pizza cost us $30. Most of the smaller pizza was thrown away too - I didn't try any of that one so I'm not reviewing it, but the wife said she was incredibly unimpressed with it, and it was just a plain cheese. If it all tasted good it would have been worth it - I'd have paid that and more for a Chuck Wagon Special from Billy's - but the lack of flavour and value drops my rating of this joint to a bottom-of-the-barrel single star. And just for proverbials and giggles: http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=inspectionResultsDrillDownAA&permit=FD-05766&business=Lucky's%20Pizza&address=15508%20W%20Bell%20Rd%20Suite%20207&insp_id=3182324

My "go to" place to grab a bite to eat when I'm in the C-Gates area of McCarran Int'l Airport.  I like to grab a Burrito & a Brewskie while I wait for my plane to depart.  Since I'm one of those guys who likes to get to the airport super early so I don't miss my flight, I have plenty of time to kill.  The FREE WiFi is awesome because I can surf the web while I enjoy my eats from this place.Return Factor - 80%BLAH is really all I can think of.  Blah, Blah, Blah.Everything tasted the same.  Everything!  I got an open chicken burrito which is basically a burrito in a bowl, opened.  It had chicken, rice, cheese, peppers, onions and the shell.  I ate a piece of chicken, tasted like the grill.  I ate some rice, tasted like the **Burnt** grill. I ate an onion, tasted like the grill.  I are a pepper, tasted like the grill.  I ate the cheese, tasted like a burnt grill with cheese on top. YUCK!  I ate about 4 forks full and was so disgusted I had to chuck it.Fail of an airport dinner to the max!

Review Text :
This Burger King is in McCarran, after you pass through security. It's my default meal choice when I'm stranded here.It's tradition for me to have a light lunch or dinner here before flying out (I even impulsively got onion rings here once after arriving in Vegas). Yes, this Burger King is reliable, but the sad truth is that airline food sucks a big fat one. Anyone else notice that this Burger King always seems to be expensive, and it's not just the sales tax talking? (It's not quite price gouging, but it comes close for fast food.) Thank goodness they take credit cards.For many, it's easy to succumb to Burger King's greasy goodness - the other businesses in this terminal don't offer much, anyway - TCBY's, I'm looking at you!

Review Text :
Alright, now were getting to the good stuff. And by "good" I mean un-fucking-believable. Yea, I said it. Unreal. Never have I wanted to pick up and move to Vegas so much in all of my life, but I'm thinking about it after the dinner I had at Sushisamba's new ultra lounge, Sugarcane. This is an incredible statement for me because for one, I can only take Vegas in small doses, and two, I despise the heat. So having said that you can believe me when I say that I love absolutely everything about Sushisamba, the Brazilian/Peruvian/Japanese fusion restaurant at the Palazzo. Where do I begin?Oh yes, Holy Mary Mother of God, I've died and gone to heaven...A friend of mine is the Publicist for this new restaurant, as well as the brand spanking new, Sugarcane. She hooked up a dinner reservation for me and some friends so that we could celebrate my good friend's birthday in style. Upon our (late) arrival we were greeted warmly by the wait staff, as they explained to us that our party would be the very first members of the public to sit down to dinner in their brand new ultra lounge. As we walked through the dimly lit hallway, past the DJ booth and dance floor, and into the dining area portion of Sugarcane we were immediately taken back by the overall design concept of the space. I"m gonna do my best to do it justice but I would highly recommend a trip here to experience for yourself because it is just too complex for words...The walls are covered with graffiti-style murals of Samurais and Japanese script, the dance floor has a canvas like screen that wraps around the circular pods that make up the women's bathrooms (see pics) where they project abstract imagery to coincide with the music playing. The DJ that night was Claudio who I wanted to put in my pocket and take home because the music was just that dope. There are multi-colored glass cylinders that hang from the ceiling and beams of light (see pics) that separate the dance floor from the dining area that change from red to orange to white that create a truly magnificent effect. The food and service is on a level that is even harder to explain - it was incredible. Our waiter Anthony took such good care of us we felt as though we were old friends by the time we left. Of course, we were the first to be seated and the last to leave, so I guess if you spend enough time with your waiter (four hours) you begin to feel like family. Our sake sommelier was a hilariously funny girl (I forgot her name) and very helpful and knowledgeable when describing our sake selections. We ended up choosing a bottle with gold leaf cherry blossoms there were supposedly good luck if you found them floating in your drink. Our table decided to order the signature Sushisamba 7-course Omakase ($70 per person) as our dinner selection. Anthony asked us if we had any food allergies or other special requests before going back to the kitchen to get our party started. Our first course was a selection of appetizers (see pics) which included the Kobe beef carpaccio with wild mushrooms, seared ahi tuna on a tiny bed of spinach, and (my favorite) tiny ceviche fish tacos with a chili foam sauce that was AMAZING! Next up was the best snow crab I have ever tasted, filet mignon, duck, Chilan Sea Bass (unreal), grilled tomatoes, fish jowel (I forget what kind) and the most beautiful sashimi plate I've ever seen/tasted. Just when we thought we couldn't eat any more came the sushi course. A stand out roll was the Kobe beef wrapped roll with (from what I can remember) a spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado center. As we sat back in our booth contemplating exactly how we were planning on walking out of there, Anthony presented the birthday girl with an incredible chocolate fondue plate (see pics) complete with Japanese-style sesame rice krispies, Japanese cake, homemade marshmallows, and a selection of fruit. There were also mini fruit tacos with both mango and banana, with a chocolate mousse and caramel topping. Do you see what I'm talking about?????Here's the rundown....Party of four:First round of cocktails (on the house)Several cocktails to followBottle of premium sake7- course Omakase dinner for four ($70 each)After dinner cocktailsDivine dessert platterTotal bill: Approx $600Not bad I'd say. Not bad at all. All in all, I plan to go back to visit several times over. Anyone who stumbles upon this place should consider themselves lucky to be in the presence of such foodie excellence. This dinner made our entire trip, and made for a very, very happy birthday girl. Sushisamba: the wait staff, the owner, the managers, the DJ. You rock my rock-n-roll world.Sushi Samba has been a hit or miss with yelpers, and here's my chance to check them out!  Featuring a special "Election Day Menu" with specialty cocktails and cheap appetizers, it was a perfect opportunity!Drinks on the menu:* Obamarama (blue) for $11 "Svedka Citron, blue curacao apple liqueur, guava, blueberry" - Really good the first time around. Pleasant to look at and just tasty-good.  The guys and gals enjoyed this drink.  The second time I ordered it, there was way too much alcohol though, and not in a good way.  A good cocktail should be enjoyable to drink; I passed the second one off.* Maverick (red) for $11 "Pearl Vodka, freshly muddled strawberries, orange liqueur, lime, guava" - Served in a martini glass, so a bit more delicate to drink.  Pretty tasty as well. I enjoyed it.Bites to eat:* Shishito Peppers ($2) "grilled spicy peppers, sea salt and lemon" - They give you a bunch of these peppers on a plate, and it was okay for me.  I tried one and found that to be good enough.  Didn't really care for more.* Organic Chicken Aji Amarillo Anticucho ($2) - I found the chicken to be okay, but really enjoyed the Peruvian corn that came with the dish.  That was the best part of it.  Our order had one skewer of chicken, but the party next to us had two? Hmm... * Spicy Crunchy Tuna Roll ($3) - Really good roll!  I liked this a lot and ordered myself another.  I like how they do their spicy sauce here; it's more mayonnaise-based.  And the slight crunch is nice too.* Salmon Avocado Roll ($3) - Pretty simple roll with just salmon and avocado.  But it was fresh fish and good.  I'm sad I didn't order more.* Mini Chicharron de Calamar ($3) "cornmeal crusted calamari with tamarind sauce, tomato salsa & plantain" - Our friend's order came out soggy, so they thought it was gross.  Ours had a better crunch on it, so it tasted better.  It wasn't particularly exceptional, it was okay.  I don't remember any plantain in my dish though.  * Japanese Chicken Wings ($4) "teriyaki and sesame" - It's hard to go wrong with teriyaki chicken wings, right?  Good, but messy.* Chilled Oyster Sampler ($4) "ponzu jelly & tobiko with three oysters" - Really fresh oysters with an interesting ponzu jelly.  We were supposed to get another order before we left, so I missed out on more!  Next time!* Mini Yellowtail Seviche ($4) "ginger garlic and soy" - Reminded me of Hawaiian poke with the dressing.  It was good with the red onions mixed in there, more poke-like than ceviche-like though.* Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos ($4) "shiso, avocado, roasted corn miso and spicy aji panca sauce" â" Two different sauces to put over the taquitos, and it was good.  Very messy though as it broke apart after the first bite and was dripping all over my hands.  Our order came with two taquitos, but when our friend ordered it, he only got one!* Rosca ($9) "homemade doughnuts with hazelnut chocolate dipping sauce" â" Recommended by our bartender/waitress as her favorite dessert.  Four doughnut holes arrived and they were just okay.  Disappointing for us, and we wished we had chosen another dessert instead.We spent the whole time at the bar because there was standing room only at this event.  So, the girl making our drinks also served us.  She was busy but tried her best to make our drinks were full and our orders were in.  (Our drinks were good for the most part except for that second Obamarama we ordered.  But hey, some people like more alcohol in their cocktails!)  I had a bigger problem with the kitchen output and their consistency.  With certain orders coming out, sometimes you got two of something and other times you got one.  Our friend mentioned that we got more sushi in our order than when he ordered it.  (Makes you wonder what happened to the other pieces.)Overall, we had a decent experience at Sushi Samba.  You definitely can't beat the price and the atmosphere is casual, which is nice alternative at a strip hotel.3.5 stars.They also offer a happy hour (Sunday through Thursday from 4 to 7 pm, and then a reverse happy hour from 10 pm to close), available in the bar area only.(Pics posted, of course!)I'm a sushi purist.  Please no fusion crap.  Very few places can pull off fusion and I'm sorry but you're definitely not in the runnings. Serve me my fish off straight from the waters onto my rice.  Thank you sir, now get outta my way you're blocking my view of the fish I'm going to devour.Huge disappointment, pricey, trendy, and mostly empty and how dare you forget my soy sauce again?  Don't you serve sushi? Doesn't it say that in the name of your restaurant? Even after I pointed it out to one of the servers he jokingly said, "yah and we're a sushi joint, you think we'd have soy sauce."Gimme my freakin soy sauce!Sushi Samba was the perfect spot to fill up on tasty food after a quick shopping spree at The Shoppes at The Palazzo with my fashionista girlfriend. We went straight for the $16 Chilean seabass bento box, which was the best deal on the lunch menu. It came with miso soup, field green salad, tuna roll and oshinko pickles. The three skewers of miso glazed seabass, along with all the sides, was a nice amount of food (though could've been a little small for a big appetite), but I seriously could have eaten three more skewers. The seabass was amazing! That miso marinade was to die for. I suppose I could've gotten the entree portion, but for lunch, it was perfect. Plus, $29 is a bit much to spend on a lunch entree. There were six tuna rolls, so that also made the bento filling.The funky decor was really cool, and reminded me a little of Blowfish in the bay area -- but much bigger and with Latin influences intertwined. The staff was awesome, and the food came out quick. We were in and out in a flash, and back to the pool before our guys even missed us.Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian fusion. I'd think that intrigue alone would be enough to bring anyone to Sushi Samba.I'll have to admit that I was nervous when our knowledgeable and friendly server began talking about the three different kitchens, the different ways to order...it all sounded way too complicated. (To be honest, I just wanted to fill my stomach so that I'd be able to drink later!) Luckily, one of our friends is a Sushi Samba master, and he did all of the ordering for our table. I pretty much loved everything - if only for the novelty of it all - but a few stand-out dishes were:1) yellowtail ceviche taquito: they looked like little yellowtail and guacemole tacos. somehow it all worked...2) yellowtail tiradito: kinda like a ceviche? yellowtail, jalepeno, and lemongrass - i'm definitely a fan of sour and spicy.3) fresh oysters and jumbo shrimp: no explanations needed.4) El Topo roll: salmon, jalepeno, melted cheese, and crispy onionsI also would recommend getting a side of Peruvian corn (which went along with our churrasco plate) just to see how HUGE those kernels are! It's kind of ridiculous. Anyway, not only was the food great, but the service was among the best - they even have a "sake sommelier", so to speak. The place itself is energetic, contemporary, and very, very Vegas. I can't wait to go back!We were in Vegas this past weekend and decided to check out Sushi Samba.  We did the tasting "omakase" menu and it was a hit with everyone on the table.  We got a nice sampling of everything there, it was all superb.  My favorite were the yellowtail tacos, yumm!  Most of all, we had a really great waitress, unfortunately i can't remember her name but she was very well informed and on top of it and she's the reason i'm giving this place 5 stars.SushiSambaSushiSamba is an Asian Fusion type of Restaurant.  It takes the combination of Japanese, Brizilian and Peruvian cuisine to create their menu.  After attending a show in the area we had the craving for some Sushi.  We had decided on Sushisamba.When we got there I think we were in between meals (lunch / dinner) so the place was now crowded.  It was kind of good like that, because it wasn't too loud and plenty of tables to select from.  Kind of dark, but yet nice ambiance.  A little music in the background, not too loud which allows you to have a nice comfortable conversation.  Not too dark to the point where you couldn't see what you were eating.  Here is what we decided to order:Rock Shrimp Tempura Golden pea shoot, snap pea jullienne, spicy mayo, black truffle vinaigrette 18.00Tasty...think I like this dish the best.  4 starshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=YfPESP5vVgqKCRts_w9uKQSea Bass and Miso  Sea Bass on a skewerTasty and flavorful, the sauce was on the sweet side.

I even picked out the most popular items (of course, according to Yelp) and took my server's recommendations. However, I expected my taste buds to have a party that night, and it fell a little short.Overall, it was a good dinner. Service was impeccable. From beginning to end, their staff worked perfectly together to make sure we enjoyed our experience. Water were always refilled, our emptied plates were cleared immediately, yet they didn't hover or rush us. Very friendly. We really couldn't have asked for a better wait staff to serve us.What did we order?Crispy Taquitos - Yellowtail & LobsterRib-Eye Robata SkewersMiso Marinated Chilean Sea Bass w/ Purple Sweet Mashed PotatoesPeruvian CornSamba Strip RollBobo Brazil RollRosca - donutsThe best tasting dishes for us was of course the Chilean Sea Bass. It was good enough that we were a bit disappointed that it was such a small serving size. Two small skewers. Peruvian Corn was also a hit. However, the sushi rolls were well presented, but lacked much in flavor. The rib-eye and taquitos were decent, but as I reiterate, all pretty to look at, yet nothing came close to being a wow.Setting is very nice, the restaurant is nice set up to accommodate large parties as well as couples. Bar serves food and offer happy hour drinks till 7pm on weekdays. I definitely appreciated the complimentary birthday dessert, the Coco Duo, which was sweet and yummy. Photos are available of all items I listed here. 3 stars for now, however I'd definitely give Sushi Samba another try. Maybe the wow will come later...While my better half was making moolah at the poker table, I needed to escape the ding-ding-ding sounds of the casino and decided to grab some happy hour. A short walk from the Encore, SushiSamba seemed to fit my need for some discounted booze and appetizers. Their long oval bar by the main entrance was pretty much empty, so I easily settled into a spot and perused their happy hour offerings. They offered three different whiskey cocktail concoctions for $6. Not being a huge whiskey fan, I picked the one that sounded the least rough to me. It was actually pretty decent, although I could have used a little more cocktail and a lot less ice. I picked three appetizers, an amount that is generally plenty at most happy hours to fill me up to the brim. The shrimp & chorizo skewers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA#rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA) were my favorite. The shrimp was barely cooked through with nice char marks and the chorizo had great flavors. The chimichurri-like sauce on top was great. I could have eaten a lot more of these. The sliced ahi tuna (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA#-AMDCTLNjWrfNMkPbPGf0A) consisted of two very thin pieces of ahi drowned  in a soy-mustard sauce and topped with a halved cherry tomato and some leaves. This portion was super tiny and made me wonder whether happy hour at this place meant you get a quarter of the portion for half the price of the regular appetizer dish... I got the same feeling with the shredded pork mini tacos (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA#i30qdbtwZSj2f8tNbjkqLQ). One bite and those suckers were gone. The spicy sauce on the side served in a shot glass looked cool, but it was so frickin' hot (the bartenders thoroughly warned me) that you could only use a mini droplet on each taco. So what was the point of serving that much sauce? Again, the portion size was disappointing and the taco was just average. Two drinks & three appetizers = $37 (including tip). I left hungry and unimpressed. For around $40 I can usually eat and drink myself into stupidity at happy hour. Sheesh, I could have had a great entree and a nice glass of wine at many of Vegas' amazing restaurants instead. Oh well, SushiSamba is overpriced for its portions and the dishes were nothing mind blowing. Don't think I'll be back here anytime soon.oh yea! love me some SUSHISAMBA! Ive dined here a few times and its always been awesome.I always start out with a watermelon mojito... its amazingly refreshing.My favorite app is the Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos. I don't even know how to describe them apart from saying they re like putting heaven in your mouth.I also always order the Pacific Roll. its  king crab, avocado, Asian pear, soy paper, wasabi-avocado crema. the pear in the roll really brings out the yellowtail and the wasabi is the cherry on top.And also you cant forget to order the Peruvian Corn. Its AMAZING.Whenever we are in Vegas and stay at the Palazzo, The Better Half insists on stopping by this joint so she can get her Sushi on.  On this particular visit, I joined her for lunch and we grubbed.She ordered 4 orders of Unagi (Eel), $4 ea. I ordered some Edamame, $6 and the Seared Wagyu Beef, $18.The Beef was awesome and while it's a small plate, it's very rich and fulfilling.  TBH enjoyed her Unagi....it's her fav.We ate lunch at around 3 pm, which is a great time to do that because it's between the busy lunch and dinner hours, so there's not too many people around.  When it gets busy, it can get crowded.We'll definitely be back.Return Factor - 90%Ever since I came here the first time I went to Vegas, I've been DYING to come back.The food is so good!  I thought we just got lucky the first time we came, but as it turns out, everything we've tried on the menu thus far is DELICIOUS.Ambiance is classy and cool.  It's a nice location within the Palazzo hotel with lots of seats.  Service was also good, as my water glass was always full despite being very busy on a Friday night at midnight.We got:MOQUECA MISTA - shrimp, squid, sea bass, coconut milk, roasted cashew, dende oil, chimichurri rice - $29 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushisamba-las-vegas?select=T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uA#T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uAThis thing is the BEST EVER.  Creamy Thai-style curry taste (hence coconut milk) with the delicate seafood mixed in with bits of crushed cashews, giving the dish great texture.  Rice was served within the sauce mixture as shown; the rice soaked up all the sauce, making every morsel DIVINE.  I thought after a while the dish would get too rich-tasting, but somehow I kept gobbling and gobbling until the plate was empty!EL TOPO SUSHI ROLL - salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion - $15 (forgot to take a pic; too excited about the moqueca mista)Very unique roll with interesting flavors and textures = Delicious!CHICKEN TERIYAKI - Samba Style organic chicken, aji amarillo, purple potato mash, crispy onion - $26 (again forgot to take a pic...)When I saw the huge price tag I thought "WTF?!", especially for a seemingly simple plate as chicken teriyaki (my friend ordered this one so I had no control).  BUTTT I'll have to say that it was probably the best teriyaki chicken I've ever had in my life!  Super juicy fillets of teriyaki chicken, pan fried (I think) to a crisp.  The sauce was perfect; not too saucy, not too dry, and definitely not overpowering to the dish.As with all finer dining restaurants, especially on the Las Vegas Strip, I did think the prices were a little inflated.  Hence the lack of that final star.  However, probably one of my favorite places to eat while in Vegas.  I'll definitely hit it up again on future trips.  They have a good happy hour too (both early evening and late night), so I'll have to take advantage of that next time! :)I'm so glad I made reservations hereI wanted to reserve a place that wasn't Italian or heavy in the Venetian or Palazzo for my group of 8 girls.  We arrived a little early for our reservation and was seated immediately.  My cousin told the waiter what we liked and didn't like.  He said he would create a meal according to what we wanted.  Everything was fantastic.  Below is what we had and its description:Pork Gyozo-  Each dumpling was served on a delicious pumpkin puree.  Delicious!Sushi Platter- We got 5 different types of rolls, 2 of each type.  They were all so good.  Tiger Rock Shrimp- Yum!  If you like honey walnut shrimp then you will definitely like this.  It was perfectly made.  Yellowtail Ceviche tacos- These were the best tacos I have ever had.  The sauce it came with was a yummy spicy foam hot sauce.  They were small but definitely satisfying.  They just melt in your mouth.  So good!  Probably my favorite thing there.  Steak- The Steak was served with collard greens, potatoes, rice, and black beans.  It also came out with 3 different sauces that were all so good.  The green sauce was my favorite.  Seabass on Skewers- This was served with some Peruvian corn.  The seabass just melts in your mouth.  They were perfectly made.  The corn was also really good and went perfectly with the seabass.     Shots- Our shots came out beautifully presented on a shot tier.  Two of us didn't drink so our waiter brought out two that were watermelon juice so we could join in on toasting.    Dessert- Dessert was a mix of the best vanilla ice cream, creme burlee, mixed berries, and banana.  It was nicely made and topped off with some sparklers.  Everything was so tasty and beautifully presented.  The food wasn't just all Japanese.  It was definitely a fusion but everything went together wonderfully.  I think for us 8 girls it was about $75 each.  It was very worth it and we all left stuffed and happy.      Our server took care of us really well.  I liked that he noted there were 8 of us and made the portions perfect for 8 girls.  One of our girls couldn't eat raw fish or anything spicy and he made sure she got her own individual thing.  He also made note that two of us couldn't drink and brought out shots for everyone with 2 virgin drinks.  He made great recommendations and was helpful.  He also took time to take a couple photos for us.  As for the the ambiance, it was beautiful.  We had a great time celebrating.On the Saturday of my bachelorette party, my girlfriends treated me to dinner at Sushi Samba.  It was a fabulous, memorable meal, where we ate well and celebrated in style.We were staying at The Palazzo, and Sushi Samba was the perfect venue for the occasion.  It was convenient to get to in heels, and the atmosphere was festive, edging on clubby without being obnoxious.  We had a big comfortable table, and service was excellent.  I wish we'd gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need, and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise.  (For management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6/29.  You know, your only bachelorette party of the month?)We ordered cocktails, which were pretty good.  I had a Blame it on Rio, a caipirinha variation with cachaça, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, cucumber, and jalapeño.  It was both cool and spicy, and it went down really easy.  The classic caipirinha was also great, with just the cachaça, lime, and sugar.  I also tried some of the Chu-Cumber, a shochu drink with Hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and muddled cucumber - very refreshing.  At some point, we got a complimentary cocktail tree, a beautiful iron tree bearing shot-sized wine glasses on every branch.  They held some frothy, sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion.Dinner was delicious.  We had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase, and we decided to keep things simple.  We specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions, and the food just started coming.  It was all served family style, and everything was well portioned for our big group.  We left full but not overstuffed - a plus, since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night.  The cuisine was fun, a creative, unforced fusion of Japanese and Peruvian styles.First, we had a trio of vegetable otsumami, all served together in a lovely green array.  There was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime, and green bean tempura served with a rich black truffle aioli.  My favorite of the three, though, was the handful of shishito peppers.  These were grilled blistering black, polished with sea salt and lemon.  They were pretty irresistible.  Next we got a tray of Japanese A5 wagyu beef gyoza.  These were great, thin-skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince.  They came with kabocha pumpkin purée, a sweet soy drizzle, and a su-shoyu dipping sauce.  The best thing I ate all night, though, was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail, avocado, and roasted corn miso.  The shell was thin and crunchy, and the fresh, tender fish was just right with that avocado, miso, and some thinly sliced vegetables.  The taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant, frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake.After the smaller plates were done, we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi.  I do not remember everything we got, as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi.  The rolls were great, a nice mix of California standards - you know, the mix and match of eel, yellowtail, tuna, etc. with avocado, cucumber, and dots of mayo - and more Samba-specific stuff, with the stray crab leg and lobster claw.  I particularly liked the Samba Strip, with Maine lobster tempura, mango, tomato, chive, soy paper, and a coating of crispy rice.  It was unusual and flavorful, served with a peanut curry.  The rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo.  The sashimi was more traditional, served on a bed of ice.  It was hard to share, as there was only one of each kind, but the slivers I had were great.The most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course.  We got two hefty platters of the Rio Grande with three meats, grilled hanger steak, ribeye, and chorizo.  These were great, juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor.  They came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil, chimichurri, and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu.  We also had some sides of rice, beans, collard greens, and a medley of roasted vegetables - giant corn kernels, toothsome brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, pearl onions, and more.  We also got miso-marinated Chilean sea bass a la carte, with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko.  This was a winner - the fish was moist, flakey, and shot through with miso flavor.We were full by dessert, but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse, served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message.  The lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls, whipped cream, and a little bit of candle-stuck banana.  We each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner.In conclusion, my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend, and for this fun, delicious meal.  Sushi Samba was an A+ choice, worthy of a night I won't soon forget.Good lunch option for Vegas! We started with the Japanese Wagyu Gyoza and all I can say is, wow! This little pockets pack a ton of flavor. I kind of wanted to order another round but I refrained. The yellowtail sashimi tiradito was also wonderful. Thick slices of fish came in a bed of lemongrass and jalapeno sauce. The let down were the rolls. We ordered the green envy and the lima and both were a little weird. I'd say avoid the rolls. The flavors were just off and coming from LA where you can find fantastic rolls at many places, I wouldn't order rolls at Sushi Samba again. The place was packed so service was a bit spotty, but I'd come back again and stick to the tiraditos and gyoza.SUSHISAMBA fuses Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian flavors- peculiar, until you realize that Brazil is home to the largest Japanese population outside of Japan itself.From edamame to plantains, wasabi to chiles, SUSHISAMBA is a true testament to the unique tastes created by immigration and integration and the balanced evolution of these flavors over the last 100 years. Having visited the Las Vegas location several times as well as the Miami one, SUSHISAMBA is high on my list of culinary experiences that delights time after time.Among my favorites is Yamato roll, comprised of tuna, foie gras, osetra caviar, topped with gold leaf. At $19 for 3 pieces, you may have to take a sledgehammer to that piggy bank, but you probably won't regret it.  Another outstanding roll is the Bobo Brazil, filled with avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, and chimichurri inside, layered with tender seared wagyu beef on the outside. Every bite melds into the tongue and disappears in a flurry of flavor.I tried the Kanpanchi Tiradito on this last visit and didn't find it worth the $19. Drizzled in yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil, the 4 small slices of amberjack were acceptable but not exceptional.On a final note, our waitress looked like a gorgeous supermodel, which worked out great in curbing my own appetite, thus making the meal more affordable. I already started a new piggy bank for next time.I didn't realize that patrons can cook at their tables until I sat down!!! Rut roh--not good for my hair!! This is fine if I wasn't going out afterwards...but I got all dressed up and was stressed the whole time about smelling like smoke, bbq, etc.  That put a kink in the experience for me, but I got through it with the help of a few rounds of cocktails:)!  My food was delicious and the service was fantastic!!!  My only complaint was the ventilation and wasting an hour getting ready.  It was good, but I'm thinking twice before going again.Well this is a new fusion- Brazilian- Sushi. Can't say I've tried a newer combo, but from the little Brazilian treats I had here, I'd have to say it works. Located in the Palazzo,  this place has an upscale, trendy vibe. Service, seating and décor were all impressive. On to the food...WHEN YOU GO- reservations are recommended if you plan on stopping by after 6. The place gets uber crowded in the evenings, especially on weekends. Like I said, I didn't get to try as much of the Brazillian side of the menu as I'd like- I'll def concentrate more on that next time. I can speak for the Waygu Taquitos. Could be the best single bite of anything I had in Sushi Samba. Delightfully crisp and light, they were the best taquitos I've ever had. The sushi held it's own but they have a lot of competition in Vegas (see my Yellowtail review). I was impressed with the Lima (shrimp, crab and avo) and the El Topo (salmon, jalapeno and mozerella!). Excellent oyster menu as well. The Kumamto's were delicious, but at $5 ea, not the best deal in town.All in all, I like Sushi Samba and will definitely be a return guest!By far, my favorite sushi restaurant in Vegas! It's Brazilian-Japanese fusion, which is very unique. The quality of everything here is amazing and very fresh. I'm extremely picky when it comes to sushi and this place definitely deserves 5 stars. The service is always impeccable and it is super clean in here. It doesn't have the fishy smell that most bad sushi restaurants have. The pricing is very reasonable for the location (inside the Palazzo and on the strip). The decor of the restaurant is pretty in-tune with the rest of the hotel and other restaurants - hip, modern, and a little funky. They have great cocktail selection and a full bar, as well as a happy hour menu. SERVICE: 5 Stars.I've never had a single complaint about the service here. Every time we come here, the service is always consistent and excellent. We celebrated my friend's 21st birthday here with a group of about 20. After ordering countless rolls, plates of sashimi, cocktails and shots, our server graciously brought the birthday princess the 3 Wise Men shots. Doing stuff like this makes you come back because a year later, my friends and I still recant this story and bring up Sushi Samba.FOOD/DRINK: 5 Stars.Everything is so fresh and good. I usually order Omakase and my favorites seem to be the Yellowtail, Uni, Fresh Ono, and Tuna. The  Tuna Tutaki appetizer is excellent and something I order whenever I come here. For non-sushi eaters, they have plenty of choices. They have a lot of unique cocktails custom to this restaurant that pair well with almost anything on the menu. You will not be disappointed eating here!Sushi samba is located inside palazzo hotel. It's got Japanese, Brazilian & Peruvian food all in one Restuarant. They have the biggest sake menu in Vegas. We saw one on the menu for $4000!!! We ordered the oysters (I wasn't a fan), shishito peppers & edamame for appetizer. I loved the shishito peppers personally.Then we ordered the yellowtail jalapeño, some specialty tuna roll that was crunchy & another specialty roll that had mozzarella cheese in it (sorry can't recall the names) & they were all very very tasty. You should expect to spend about $50-60/person at this Restuarant. Overall, it was good & I recommend it to everyone especially if you are staying at the Palazzo hotel.  The waiter & the hostess were very friendly & nice. Our waiter was originally from Baltimore & he was very nice.

I had a hankerin for a bagel and this location is on my way home from my early morning drive to mesa and back, so I stopped one morning and kept returning. After an unfortunate incident last month though, I won't be coming back to this location.My first couple experiences were fine. Not amazing but I got my order quick enough (sometimes correct, sometimes not) and the location was easy to get in and out. My last visit was just bizarre.I placed my order with the cashier since there were only a couple customers in line and no one was working the order station on the opposite end. One of the employees was fiddling with the screen that shows the orders because it wasn't working correctly. I paid for my sandwich and waited...and waited...and waited...Another patron and I made small talk while watching the one sandwich maker fiddle with the screen some more. The assistant manager was cleaning the coffee equipment. Another employee came out to work the order station and gather bagels for customers who ordered boxes. One guy came from the back to fill the ice machine. Another employee proceeded to eat his food while clocking out for break. The cashier continued to stand around. The other patron and I continued to make small talk.Silly me to think that the girl messing with the equipment will realize that people are waiting for food...I should have spoke up sooner. 13 minutes go by until I say something. "Sorry, we're having issues with the order screen". No shit - how about you start hand writing orders or communicating with the person taking them? Thank you for exhibiting zero problem solving skills.Oh, and the assistant manager? Still cleaning the coffee equipment. No leadership whatsoever.I can put up with incorrect orders, or waiting when it's busy, but I can't put up with lackluster customer service. I'll go out of my way to the 16th st and Camelback location when I have another bagel craving.

This place just couldn't be any more consistent, clean or great.  I've come back about six times since my first review.  It's just spotless -- and I really appreciate that.  But it's really about the food.  It's just great.  Seriously, if you're homesick for Southern food -- greens, hushpuppies and zero-grease catfish that doesn't taste muddy, this is it.   I don't know how they do it -- it's just delicious.  Did I mention that the corn fritters rock.  For lunch, this is a great find.  I can't ever clean my plastic plate -- 2 piece special that comes with 2 sides.  I usually get double greens and couldn't be happier.  If I've got a guest with me, I'll splurge and we'll split either the fried green beans or the corn nuggets (they're back).   Never can clean my plate --and that's just fine.  Seriously -- if you're on the east side, this place is just wonderful.I just went here for the 1st time a week ago but I had to go back & get some more of that catfish so I did. Well being highly medicated I ordered a Family 8pc catfish cajun-style  w/hushpuppies and 2 sides(baked beans & fried okra), plus mac n cheese bites. The catfish once again was outstanding, as were the hushpuppies but I was a little disappointed with the rest which is why I've deducted 1 star. Granted it was take out and I didn't get to eat it hot & fresh. The mac N cheese bites were not impressive at all. The okra looked real tasty but didn't make it home crunchy.The beans were just beans,probably canned. I really like this place, the owners run it and its very homey.

Review Text :
Pholicious is a new vietnamese restaurant that just opened in Peoria.  I just love the name of this restaurant: PHO - [pronounced fuh, or fur] is vietnamese beef noodle soup that has existed for more than 90 years + LICIOUS - these days you can add that suffix to just about any base word and you know it is something good. Anyways, got a flyer in the mail for this place and being a fan of vietnamese food decided to give it a go.  We walked in to a restaurant filled with Vietnamese people.  Now this gets me excited because I know it has to be authentic and delicious.  I ordered a cup of crab/asparagus soup - $2.95 for a cup!  And more than a generous amount. Shrimp fried rice - $7.95! Delicious, tasty, cooked to perfection.  The shrimp were not the baby shrimp, but were rather large.  D. ordered the vermicelli w/beef - $6.95!  This was an absolutely delicious dish, extremely flavorful. There are sooooo many things to try on this menu, the selection is huge and the prices cannot be beat.  I know we will be back soon to dine-in or order take-out.When your partner's least favorite kind of food is your most favorite kind of food, you have to pick and choose your battles.For me, this means only suggesting Asian cuisine when Misty S is a) not feeling good, b) not feeling Yardhouse, or c) not paying. All of these scenarios have one thing in common; they rarely ever happen.But alas, as chance would have it, Misty S and I both came down with something over the holidays.Thus, I began my attack."Let's get some pho.""I hate pho.""It'll make you feel better.""No thanks. I don't like pho.""Oh wow, you know what sounds really good right now? A big bowl of soup. Hot, steaming soup. Oh man, Ci Ci's has soup! All the chicken soup you can eat, and pizza too! Snap, chicken soup and jalapeno pizza! We'll be good in no time!""Fine, we'll do Pho."Ironically, when we pulled into Pholicious we saw what may have at one point been a greasy child-infested Ci Ci's, now closed to the world like a tomb. A graveyard of all-you-can-eat-awfulness.Walking inside, I could literally feel the steam off of other people's bowls. It was like a sriracha flavored sauna. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a gentleman drinking coconut juice right out of the fruit itself. And waiters carried around massive bowls of noodles and stuff and other stuff. For a moment I felt that I had found my perfect restaurant.And that's when I panicked.For it is practically written in the cosmos that the more I love an Asian restaurant, the more likely Misty S will find it lacking. See Also: Wong'sSee Also: Dragon Garden ExpressSee Also: Any Chinese Buffet....ever.One of the many joys in dining-in at any Asian restaurant (sushi included) is that I'm not expected to actually pronounce any of the items from the menu. That's why there's all the numbers.Whenever I go for Mexican or Italian the waiter looks at me like I'm a tool if my pronunciation's off and corrects me before having a good laugh at it.Oh, thank you, JEFF, for imparting your SUPERIOR knowledge of the Italian language onto me. Here, before you leave, can you make sure I'm pronouncing this correctly...Vaffunculo e muoia! Now bring the check, I'm going to the Olive Garden.I ordered the #2 (spring roll), and the #40 (egg noodle soup with barbeque pork, prawns, quail egg, and something something).The spring roll was deceptively delicious for a bunch of shrimp, rice, and veggies rolled up in cold rice paper. It came with a nice thick peanut sauce that was topped with peanuts. I love it when there are multiple forms of the same ingredient in a dish. It's so aesthetically pleasing from a deconstructivist standpoint. Blah blah blah, pretentious bullshit, blah blah blah.Before my number 40 came out, Misty's #10 (crab and asparagus soup) was served, and Misty invited me to take part of her soup. It was warm, eggy and soft. Almost with a hint of sweetness, I thought. Light, subtle, and very white. Satie, one of my favorite composers, used to eat "white food" so that he could get into the mood to compose "white music".This is what you learn at art school.My number 40 was awesome. Simply awesome. Spicy, sweet, sour, noodly and meaty. It even came with a side of bean sprouts and chili peppers that I could throw into the soup myself. It was like hot pot but much cheaper and without me screaming at the top of my lungs if someone could please pass me the fucking fish balls. The soup was so good that even after all the noodles and meat were gone I still sat there, sucking down broth by the spoonful. Misty tried several times to coach me on the proper way to hold the porcelain spoon, but alas, I make as proper a lady as I did a boy back in the day. C'est la vie, I guess.After all the sriracha and peppers I had added, the broth was so spicy that my nose was running and my eyes were watering. I looked like I had just been cut from the Rocky Horror cast and yet I still sucked that soup like I've never had it so good. The waiter came by and took away the broth while I was trying to cool off with some ice. I remember thinking "awww man, I wasn't done with that" but aftewards feeling grateful that I was being inadvertantly saved from myself.I feel like I've got a sniffle coming on. Maybe if I wait it out a bit I can do my sad puppy face routine long enough that Misty gives in and takes me back to Pholicious again soon.(After learning I was writing this review, Misty would like to remind me and inform all of you that she doesn't hate ALL Asian food. She's particular to Malay and Indian food, but can't stand all that "panda express" nonsense I gorge myself on. Surprisingly, I don't mind being the tacky and tasteless one in the relationship.)I hate pho. I do. I hate almost all Asian food save Malaysian, Thai and Indian. And those can be pretty interchangeable considering the former is often a hodgepodge of the latter. I find pho boring, and only eat it when I'm sick. You know this. You read Jetta R's review already.So what's with the 5 stars, right?I'm a skeptic to the extreme. We ordered Thai iced tea and I was very, very dissapointed (and a wee bit smug) that theirs comes right out of the can. That was all it took for me to cross my arms and begin the nay-saying. We're waiting for her General Tsao Chicken, and my Orange Chicken lunch special. Poor Jetta's puppy-dog-facing me over the table, trying to placate my snide and pessimistic predictions about the food we'd yet to be served. "Watch. It's going just to be plain chicken breasts with orange slices on top."And then it came, and I shut my mouth. It was so...pretty. Fried rice shaped into a perfect little mound. Crispy chicken glistening in sweet-but-not-too-sweet-even-if-you're-super-picky-like-me sauce. And the taste. OMG. I'm a believer in Chinese food again. Chinese food from a Vietnamese restaurant. And sprinkled throughout - why yes, tiny little mandarin orange slices, cut into quarters. What the hell, Pholicious? Are you trying to kill me with perfection? I've got a reputation to keep. Maybe it was a fluke. Maybe I could still hate this place. Jetta and I returned today, me with chopsticks in hand and ready for a show down. It's on now, bitches. Kung Pao Chicken. Bring it. And they did, while smiling and telling my bestie she looked pretty today. Damn, they're sneaky!And the chicken? ...perfect. Again. Jetta's pho? Also perfect. And I HATE pho.You win this time, Pholicious. I admit defeat. Take your 5 stars while I sulk off into the sunset. Can we rematch tomorrow?A solid Vietnamese joint. Period.  Its not the most authentic but it gets the job done!Why you should be eating here:x Pho Dac Biet: clean and balanced, beefy broth, meat and noodle portions are just right (fresh veggies + lime)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Rvj3cDAiXInbZD4l6bw-lg?select=EGWxdJ5WZ8XaXuLnfcK5Sgx Bun Bo Hue: good, tasty broth, well cooked meat, good portion on noodles, sadly bone-in pork and pork blood were not provided but still enjoyable without! (fresh veggies + lime)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Rvj3cDAiXInbZD4l6bw-lg?select=YiuFqOiNEoF4YUtGEasI4Qx Vermicelli: Excellent portion, nicely cooked meat and shrimp, tasty fish sauce, egg roll pieces were crisped and cut to fit bowl (fresh veggies)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Rvj3cDAiXInbZD4l6bw-lg?select=LPKP2hyjUy6gyQwHH1afUAx Chicken Wings in Butter Sauce: Served crispy and hot, very tastyx Ban Xeo: Crispy shell/batter, good, tasty pork/sprouts filling!Service is pretty typical of any other Viet joint except this place is a tad friendlier, actually! Warm welcome and refills water when low.Viet music played in the background, LCD TV will have something playing.  Decor is very clean and modern.For the most part this place is really straight forward, no mixed messages or dramas.  Sit down, order, eat, and bounce!

Review Text :
I should have known that an Italian restaurant with a French name would be bad news.  Its just the start of the identity crisis going on.....I don't really get what they're trying to do here.  Are they aiming to be an upscale restaurant?  Because the servers in t-shirts and the stripper poles placed throughout the dining room don't really lend themselves to that.  (And yes, I said stripper poles..... metal poles placed in between two leather arm chairs....)  The menu suggests they are trying to go in the direction of casual upscale but the quality of food and service doesn't support that.  I asked our server for a suggestion for a light, dry, non mineral-y white wine.  I got a very oakey, buttery, heavy white.  Totally what I asked for, thanks.  Overall the wine list was unimpressive, however, I did like the fact that you can order a quartino.  I was underwhelmed by the service; our server would disappear for long stretches of time and served me the salad my friend ordered in addition to serving the wrong beers to the wrong people. He also seemed to be lacking knowledge on the food that we ordered, telling my husband that the soup had pancetta flavor, when it actually had pancetta in it.  Other members of my party had their flatware replaced after using their knife for bread and butter while I did not.  It was spotty service all around.  The quality of the food did not make up for the poor service.  Two people in our party ordered the scallops, a Bostonian and a New Orleanian who are used to great scallops.  We both agreed they were pretty awful - very much overcooked; very chewy.  Scallops should not be chewy, you should not have to work at eating them, they should just melt in your mouth.  Not to mention one of the scallops was a bit sandy and obviously had not been properly cleaned.  I know, I know, stupid me, I shouldn't order seafood in the desert.  Especially after eating amazing seafood for a week in NY.  The glace that they were served in had an extremely strong black licorice flavor.  I am not a fan of black licorice, in fact I know nobody that is.  The vegetables that accompanied the scallops were limp.  The aforementioned soup that my husband ordered did not have quite the right consistency due to the presence of the extremely hard pancetta which detracted from the texture of the beans.  His salad was ok; it did come with huge flakes of toasted garlic which fooled him as he thought they were almond flakes.  When asked if we would like dessert one my friends threw down an emphatic "No, just the check!" because the whole experience was just sub par and no dessert nor digestif could possibly save it.Just as a side note....I know that I'm a short girl but I hate it when I go to restaurants and sit on benches and my feet don't touch the ground.  It makes me feel stupid.  The food, the service, the atmosphere....whatever it is that they are aiming for just isn't working.I'm basing this review of my visit on a first impression. Sometimes a first impression is all it takes. I met my friend Heather C for lunch at Digestif. We walked in and were greeted by a friendly hostess. Our server was at our table as soon as we were seated. He overheard me admiring their absinthe fountains and he ran to get me information on where to buy one just like theirs. I thought it was very nice of him. He then ran through their specials of the day. I nearly fainted when he stated that they had a foie gras burger topped with arugula to offer for lunch. I am A LOVER of foie gras. I immediately ordered it but asked for no arugula. The waiter stated that the chef offers baby spinach instead. Perfect. After a bit of wait, our food was served. Ah... what can I say my fellow foodies? The food was beautiful! I had to take several pictures of it for my food porn collection (see pic). I did away with the bun and ate the meat and the french fries. It was fabulous. The burger was a ground up flat iron steak and the foie gras was served on top of it with the baby spinach finishing off the creation. Fantastic, well cooked, and full of flavor. If this is any indication of the quality of the food at Digestif, I will certainly become a devoted fan. It will be interesting to see if my next visit will be just as good if not better...we shall see!

Review Text :
Had dinner tonight at Eddie Matney's new restaurant, Eddie's House with some friends.  Eddie's opened yesterday In Scottsdale at Marshall Way and Indian School. What a great experience.The restaurant is very comfortable, the art work and decor are fun, the service was superb, the food is outstanding and it is priced reasonably. Meets all my criteria for a good restaurant. You never would have known that this was only their second day in business.We had fish, meatloaf and barbecue chicken (a little spicy). The portions were generous and everyone enjoyed their meals.There is a reason that Eddie calls this Eddie's House. You feel like you are sitting in his dining room. Eddie came around a few times to check in on us to see how everything was. As we were finishing up, he pulled up a chair and talked with us for a while. Great customer service. We will definitely go back.I really really enjoyed Eddie's House.  It was cool, relaxed and high end all at the same time.  We were late for our reservation and it wasn't a problem (thank goodness).  The staff is spot on and friendly.  The chairs-- oh the chairs are so comfortable and you start off with fresh bread and butter with a pesto dipping sauce.  mmmmmmmm.The entrees were delicious as well.  I had the steak salad and it was divine.  Other diners in our party had, the Cobb Salad, the lettuce wedge with bacon and dressing and the burger with waffle fries.  Eddie himself came out to help my friend cut her burger.  He cut it in fours for her and he said that's how he cuts it for his kids.  It was cute.We didn't have dessert but we drank so to me, that is dessert and appetizer and main course sometimes. Our server was really friendly and happy to answer any of our questions.  I am looking forward to our next night out at Eddie's House!Chef Eddie Matney is doing something right at "Eddie's House."I'm not sure why it took me so long to go visit him, but now that I've been, I for sure will be hanging out there again soon.  We really did feel like we were hanging out with Eddie in his living room.  We sat at the bar where Valerie was the bartender / server and gave us honest answers to all of our questions about the menu. We also made friends with Victor and Bob - the other guys sitting at the bar while we dined.  Jared even went so far as eating one of Victor's "sweet chicken lollipop drumsticks" and half of Bob's "chocolate chip cookie tiramisu."  In addition, we did order our own food...We shared two appetizers (great deal during happy hour - all half off as well as half price glasses of wine)...  Scallop carpaccio and "Jacob and Gabriella's favorite edamame."  (Jacob and Gabriella are Eddie's kids by the way).From there, Jared had one of their specials - short rib and prawns.  The prawns (of which I stole one to taste) were crazy big, cooked just right, and very tasty.  I went with a half order (love that they allow you to do that) of the sea bass which comes with broccolini.  It was the perfect size... and delicious.  The sea bass melted in my mouth!  I didn't even share a bite with Jared 'cause I loved it so much!  Of course, we just had to get dessert as well... and despite Valerie suggesting otherwise, we chose the apple pear cobbler a la mode.  It was good but a bit doughy.  We'll have to stick with the tiramisu or try the orange cheesecake instead next time.Chef Eddie himself came out of the kitchen and socialized with us several times during our meal - i love when a chef is personable like that.  We noticed he was doing the same with other guests as well.  The rest of the staff was extremely attentive and friendly to boot.Oh, and a few more things to note about Eddie's House: the decor is warm and welcoming, very comfortable bar stools, a flatscreen TV at the bar, an outdoor patio, cool ass fly fishing photos in the men's room (according to Jared), and take out is available... I saw one guy take-out for his entire family while we sat there!We can't wait to go visit Eddie again - hopefully sooner rather than later!Stopped by for happy hour in early May.  Sat at the bar, which was still empty as it was only 4:30p.  After inquiring about menu items and possible allergens, I settled on the beef kabobs ($8 during happy hour), and the table bread basket (white and flatbread), which both contained allergens- I only had the nerve to try the white, which was good with the pesto butter.  The four 3-inch skewers consisted of tiny chunks of seasoned beef, tri-colored bell peppers, and onions with a chipotle sauce and mayo.  These were tasty, but not worth $8, or the long wait (One: they're kabobs, which usually do not take long to cook!  Two: they're MINI kabobs!)I'll give EH another try.  Sometime, but not soon."Share the passion." This should be every chef's motto, and modus operandi.Passion is truly experienced here, via the tastebuds.The moment you meet Chef Eddie Matney, he makes an impression.  He treats you as family, not as clientele.  He has life just bubbling out of him.  He jokes, he teases, and you get this overwhelming urge to take him by the hand and say,'tell me everything you know." I wonder if he would start by teaching me how to cut a tomato without getting the guts all over the chopping board...The food at Eddie's House is just like his personality.  Dynamic, fun, eccentric, and innovative.  Before coming to Phoenix to open numerous restaurants in the Valley, he created culinary delights in Massachussetts.  This influences a lot of the menu items.  You can experience surf and turf east coast style, or a blending of traditional american dishes with flavors from around the globe.  This is why his style of cooking is referred to as the "melting pot" style.Currently, Eddie's is serving an incredible deal: Maine Lobster Dinner with sweet corn on the cob and buttered potatoes, for $20.  Ongoing deals are the ability to order nearly all entrees in "half orders." want to try the seabass and the seared diver scallops? you can!  for half the price of the regular sized entree.  Happy Hour is a fantastic deal, as well!   Come here between 4-8p Friday and Saturday, or all night Mondays-Thurdays -  and all the appetizers are 1/2 off, as well as many great cocktails for $5, in addition to beer and wine specials.I can easily eat two baskets of bread, with the incredible pesto and gorgonzola butter that comes with it.Best Appetizers:jacob and gabriella matney's favorite edamameToasted Horseradish-Mashed-Potato Stuffed ShrimpTuna Tartar Nachos, Arizona corn & cilantro Best Entrees:Chermoula Roasted Chilean Sea Bass, candied lemon broccolini (i had an orgy in my mouth)East-Meets-West Sesame Tuna & Parmesan Halibut, bok choy, asparagus risotto  (i have never had halibut this beautiful)The Famous, One-and-Only, "What's-In-This?" SteakAside from my love for the sea bass and halibut, I will return time and again for the superior quality, fresh and inventive ingredients, and a comfortable and vibrant atmosphereIf Eddie's House ever rents a room, I'm moving in!  4.5 stars, but I think I'm too stingy with that 5th star sometimes.  Fear of commitment maybe?  I had dinner here with Dottsy Z before the infamous night at Brackin's, right there is a good start to a 5-star evening.  We sat at the bar and started with a glass of wine.  Nice wine list.  By that I mean not too overwhelming for a novice.  I'm no wine expert.  If I can get it down easier than a shot of Everclear, that's good enough for me.As appetizers are half off in the bar during happy hour, we went with three.  I was hesitant with the tuna tartar nachos.  If it walked, flew, or swam prior to being on my plate, I want it cooked.  But, I was pleasantly surprised. The tuna was seasoned so well, I enjoyed it.  The toasted seafood wontons are a take on the crab cheese puffs at most Chinese restaurants, but oh so much better.  I could have eaten a dozen of these bad boys.  Too bad there were only 4 and Dottsy actually expected to partake as well.  The horseradish mashed potato stuffed shrimp rounded out our trio.  I can't say I had ever had a shrimp stuffed with mashed potato, and I'm sad about that.  The shrimp were large, plenty of room for stuffin', and it was quite a tasty dish.  I believe you get 4 shrimp as well.Hold on, we're not done eating.  We also ordered two half dinners.  First, the famous "What's-In-This" Steak.  Here's a hint:  steak.  This is Eddie's version of a shepherd's pie.  The mashed potatoes were well-seasoned and the steak was exceptionally tender.  Finally, we tried the seared diver scallops with apricot goat cheese risotto, my favorite of the evening.  Scallops were cooked perfectly, and the risotto was spectacular.As far as the appetizers, they really only serve 2, or 1 if you're me.  So sit in the bar if you'll order several as they are a little expensive.  And be careful of the half dinners.  While the steak would be enough for me, a half order of scallops was only 2 scallops.  So unless you just want a taste, go with the full meal or try two different entrees!This little gem is in my neighborhood, and I'm kicking myself I hadn't visited sooner, but I look forward to going back!Time to break out the five star rating!Eddie's House does not disappoint, and in fact sets the standard in my book.  I truly wish that every dining experience could be as pleasant, comfortable, and tasty as our visit to Eddie's House. The bar is spot on, with well mixed drinks.  Appetizers were outstanding!  We tried a BLT type pizza which sounds crazy, but was incredible.I had to get my favorite meatloaf on the world.  It just is too good for words.  I do not have the words for this place!!Deserts also rocked.  Yes, we really did it up this visit.  Thanks Eddie Matney for a wonderful time!!!  We will be back!Just had dinner service for the first time.  Excellent service.  Excellent food.  We tried the grilled lamb chops with cumin hummus for an appetizer.  I usually won't eat lamb, but did take a taste, and damn those were good.  It's too bad for me those little lambs are so adorable before they're slaughtered.  Also tried the tiramisu for dessert.  Ladyfingers are replaced by cookie dough!  I think I'm in love with Eddie.  SHHH.Gabi took Stephanie I. and I here on our first night in Phoenix. Eddie's was participating in Yelp Eats, so she wanted to give us a taste of one of Scottdale's best restaurants.We each started with a glass of wine - which by the way, they have an excellent selection to choose from! Then I stared at the menu for about ten minutes deciding...it all looked SO good. I rarely say that. Most of the time, my eyes find something - one thing - that really pops out at me. Not on Eddie's...it ALL popped out at me!After much deliberation (Gabi and Stephanie kept staring at me like I was crazy for taking so long) and a last-minute switcheroo, I ordered the half order of cilantro & ginger crusted ahi tuna with wasabi, mashed potatoes and mango soy bean ponzu. I knew I'd be happy.And happy I was! The ahi tuna was seared perfectly, and the colors were so vibrant on my plate. It was almost too pretty to eat, seriously. And then it was like heaven on my tastebuds. I was already halfway full from munching on the bread basket that came before the meal, or I would have requested the other half of my meal.After we finished and I didn't possibly think I could stuff down anything else, of course came the dessert menu. How could I refuse after a meal like that? We decided on the tiramisu. I was half-excited, because I'm not usually a tiramisu fan. Eddie just changed my mind about that...as long as there's cookie dough and chocolate involved, I'm in. I had a hard time setting down my fork!I can't say enough great things about Eddie's (as you can tell, obviously). Even the service was top-notch!And the added bonus? Eddie himself came by our table and chatted with us. After just a few minutes, it felt like I'd known him for 10 years and he was throwing us a personal dinner party. It was win-win for everyone!I made a reservation for 6:30pm and we arrived just before that. We were told that our table was not ready yet, but it would only be 3 minutes before we were seated because we were next. We went to the bar to have a glass of wine as we waited.  During this time the hostess sat 2 other parties of 4 in front of us. Each time I asked about our table and she would say 'oh, yes, you are next but your table isn't ready'. Finally, at 7:20pm, we were seated at our table. We were told, by the hostess, the delay was because of the lobster special. I find that strange because the couple at table next to us said that you had to order the lobster in advance with your reservation so I doubt that was the actual cause. My wife ordered the Famous Steak. I get concerned any time a restaurant butterflies a filet, but it sounded good. My wife asked that it be prepared medium rare and was very specific because after the steak is cooked it is covered in mashed potatoes and baked again. Unfortunately, the steak came out medium well. We sent it back and did get another one cooked properly. However, by the time the replacement steak came out we were almost done eating. I ordered the meatloaf based on our servers recommendation. I thought it was just average and really did not care for the crispy (aka burnt) edges. The other couple we were with ordered the East meets West (surprising small portion) and the burger. There was no ketchup on the plate with the burger and by the time some arrived at the table the burger had gotten cold. Drinks from the bar were slow as well. It took over 10 minutes for a vodka on the rocks to arrive. Our server was fantastic and we did feel bad making our concerns known because we knew that she would be held responsible even though the wait and over cooked food was not her fault. Eddie's wife stopped by the table and we politely told her about our dining experience.  We were not looking for any type of handout, we just wanted her to know what was going on in her restaurant.  She was very nice and sent over a round of desserts and invited us to call her before our next trip back. Overall the food did not live up to what we were expecting. Maybe we caught them on a bad night. We might go back to try it again, but not if we would have to wait 40 minutes after our reservation time for a table.Three words: bacon infused meatloaf. I could end my review right now and that would be all you'd need to know to make your decision. I am shocked this place has a 3.5 star average because my experience here was nothing short of 5 stars. The atmosphere here is casual but classy and it's the perfect location for a date night or a night out with family or friends. The open kitchen allows the guest to see the chef create the masterpiece and the staff is extremely friendly every step of the way. But the food is really what makes this place a 5 star in my book. I don't often eat meatloaf, but when I do, I want it to be sublime. This was more then sublime, it was heaven with every bite! I don't know how they infused bacon into the meatloaf, but there was a delicious taste of bacon with every single bite. I also liked the fact that I could order a half order and trust me, the half order is still extremely large! The burger here is also spectacular, as well as the Mo' Rockin Shrimp with chili-beer dipping sauce, dough balls. This restaurant is a hidden gem and one I wish I made my way to more often. PS - for all you locals out there, the vibe of Cookin' Jacks still lingers and in a good way. It brings back memories!

Review Text :
Sooo Many FREAKIN LOCALS. I like the ambiance. The food I haven't tried. The drinks are....well drinks. The dfrink menu has a good selection from the actual blue martini, cookies and cream martini, ets...I think overall as a bar they do well. They bring in a dj at night and turn the place into an all out club till 4am. It seems like the djs know how to get jiggy with it and they're all about opp. Eh I guess I really wanted it to be a place to chill at.You get a combination of different people who come here. Sure tourists.....But mostly locals. Lots of Cougars, velociraptors. Industry people, and socialites. Its weird to see them all in one place. The thing I don't like is the trek to the bathroom - it's like if you had to pee or throw up and you were in the outside patio, you're screwed. ESPECIALLY for Number 2! They have security guards and vip hosts, so ya it's kinda clubby. It does hold over 1100 people. So definitely good times. If you're a guy and you can't get laid here then stay home with your credit card handy and a new subscription to adult friendfiners. But be careful. This is a locals place and a lot of people know a lot of people....But ladies it is a smorgasboard of dudes who are too cool for school and vip hosts, and clubbers, and douchers. Ya have fun with that. I should have just not missed the movie.A locals' place off the strip, but close enough!With their happy hours from 4 pm to 8 pm everyday, it's definitely worth checking out the Blue Martini!  We arrived shortly after 6 pm on a weekday and grabbed a coveted table outside on the patio.  All their specialty martinis and wines are half-priced, as well as everything on the menu!  (Desserts included!)  What a steal!The BF ordered the Down & Dirty (Ketel One Vodka and Olive Juice served with Three Large Olives) and I had the Bellini (Ketel One Vodka, Peach Schnapps, House Champagne, and a splash of Orange juice).  They bring the shaker to you and pour it tableside, which I think is great.  Not only does the waitress not have to worry about balancing the delicate martini glass, but you don't have to worry about trying to drink from a very full glass.  They average about to $7-$8 each during HH.We started off with the St. Louis Style Spinach & Artichoke Dip (Spinach & Artichokes Mixed with a St. Louis Provel Cheese Sauce, Topped with Parmesan and Served Hot with Toasted Pita Triangles).  Like Mr N. mentioned, the pita chips are rock hard.  I'm not sure if they are intentionally supposed to be this hard, but they could soften them up a bit!  A pretty decent order for the price you're paying and pretty good too.I had the Chicken Quattro Formaggi (8oz. Lightly Breaded Seasoned Chicken Breast Stuffed with Four Cheeses (Asiago, Parmesan, Mozzarella, & Provolone) served with Seasoned Rice, Marinated Artichoke Hearts Accompanied by a Roasted Red Pepper Sauce), which is odd since I don't usually like to order chicken breast.  I think the whole 'stuffed with four cheeses' got my attention and that's what sold me.  I had to ask for more sauce so the chicken had more flavor.  The accompanying artichoke hearts and greens lightened up the meal.  The BF enjoyed my dish.The BF scored a winner with the Miniature Martini Lamb Chops (8oz. of Mint Marinated Rack of Lamb served with Seasoned Rice).  They were so moist and tasty, not gamey at all!  We had to ask for more of the green sauce because it tasted so good!  I wish I ordered this instead!  We'd definitely go back for this dish alone!It's pretty chill hanging out there in the evenings.  It gets super packed though, so good luck trying to score a table if you come with a large party.  You can always grab seating inside, but it's pretty dark in there in my opinion.  And yes, there are a lot of fake tans, pretty boys in their shades and 'roids.  An amusing place to people watch if anything.I have to agree with Myke R. about the restrooms being way too far.  Coming from the patio, it's a trek to meander yourself around the tables and crowds just to pee and wash up.  (I did see Allison J. though on my way to the loo!)Overall, Blue Martini is a pretty cool place to hang out during happy hour.  I don't think I'd want to fight the crowds though during weekends and nights since this place fills up.  They do check ID, so no kiddies in here at all.  Update! 05/31/08 - Went back for HH on a Friday night and this place is PACKED!  * Seared Tuna (Sushi grade ahi tuna resting on a nest of asian seaweed and calamari salad, served with asian sesame dressing and wasabi.)  I'm not a big fan of seared tuna, but the seaweed, ginger, and calamari combo definitely added a nice contrast.* Bruschetta (Fresh Diced Roma Tomatoes Marinated with Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Garlic and Basil Served on Toasted Sliced Bread Rounds Topped with Parmigiano Reggiano Cheese)  Nothing special, pretty basic that anyone could make at home.I also tried a couple of their flatbreads.  By the time I got to it, It had been sitting out for awhile, so they were not hot as they should be.  Probably tastes a lot better when you eat them right away.* Mango Madness (Finlandia Mango Vodka, Mango Schnapps, a splash of Pineapple juice) So so good!  A bunch of people from our group was drinking this and we all loved it!  A definite fave of the house, even for guys! (You can find pics of our happy hour experience in the business profile.)Ok...Are you seriously charging covers at the door? So I pull up with my roommate at BM to just have a quick drink - see one of the manager friends. Then the guy at the door says,"The line's not that long, you should stand in line."  Uhm my roommie works at Yardhouse. If she had her uniform on then she would walk right in. Then every week we send a photographer every Wednesday to take pictures for spyonvegas which costs us money. Now all the owners of my company are friends with the owners of BM. Even when I showed them my business card, he was a douchebag. Well There's lots of people in the industry that come here and we can't honor everyone. WTF? Because of this. I officially DOUCHEBAG Blue Martini to Bowel Movement.Viva Las Vagueness!Man, they ruined that song by turning it into a Viagra commercial. Can I get a witness? I mean, seriously. I hear that song and I start seeing blue, which brings me to my review of Blue Martini. Here's how it breaks out, and let's start with the good:1. Hot patrons (for me, the women).2. Hot waitresses (yes, they're female as well)3. Large and roomy venue.4. Indoor AND outdoor space.5. Waitresses=hot.6. Did i mention there were a large number of attractive women of the female persuasion there?7. The place was mostly populated by locals, which gets you away from the rotund, behemouth, gargantuan, midwestern, muumuu-clad tourists that seem to permeate the Las Vagueness vicinity.8. See numbers 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 above.9. They have a happy hour that offsets #2 under the "not as good" section below. Unfortunately, we weren't at it.  Bah.10. They're open LATE, i.e., like 4:00am.The not as good:1. My "Blue Martini" was blue, but it wasn't a martini. It was also overly sweet.  They have other "martinis" that I didn't try, but perhaps those are better. 2. $12 martinis feels like NYC, price-wise, and let's be serious; this is Vegas, not NY.3. $6 domestic beers.3a. $8 foreign beers.4. The lovely waitresses lost one of my party's credit card.  That kind of put a damper on the evening temporarily.5. Service was a little uneven, but we got hugs from the waitress, so uh, let's just leave it at that.6. At a venue filled with hot chiquitaz, they managed to seat us next to a table full of gay men, which would have been ok, except one of them was rubbing his ass up against me after having hit on me.  I could have lived without that, mos' def.7. It's a little ways out of town, and as any of you who have been to Vegas recently knows, cab rides are freakin' astronomical. Don't be surprised when it costs some bucks to get there, but hell, you're in Vegas where ponying up is part of the reason you go, am I right?Overall, this is a fun joint. The band was playing bad cover tunes, but hey, it's Vegas, you can forgive them. It was more than made up for by the quality of the eye candy therein, etc, and what have you. In between band sets they played some cool 80's tunes, which seemed to work nicely.If you're in Las Vagueness, hit up Blue Martini. I'll be sure to go there again next time I'm in town.Good happy hour.  Definitely the best and maybe only time to go.  This place has to have the LV Yelp record for most reviews with the word DOUCHE in it.  Hilarious!!You do get quite the bang for your buck with the $7 martinis at happy hour.  It's almost like 2 for one since the shaker still has a lot of drink left.My friend took me out to this place on Wednesday night. It's very loungey, and SUPER casual. Wednesdays are I guess girls night out, so all the drinks are 50% off. Can't complain! Not to mention, my friend is a bartender at the Hard Rock Hotel, so we got 30% off on top of that! 3 drinks= $20. Down. Overall, the drinks were alright I'm not a martini type gal, but it got me through the night. In other words..it got me drunk lol.4 drinks, and I was on a good level. The live music was awesome! The band was great, and they were playing all the current hits, and all the old school hits..I loved it!The crowd was very mixed. A mixture between old men and young gals.... :x Overall, it's an alright place. Probably not a place I would take my friends to though.Oh yeah, and I got a drink spilled allll over me here. Cool beans.. -_-Uhh....so THIS is supposed to be one of the hot spots for locals??? =/ It was a fun night for me because I had good company with me. But besides that....it was boring! We arrived around 11:45p on a Friday night and it wasn't busy at all. -Weird mixed crowd. Don't expect XS/Marquee/Tao here. I saw a few girls wearing flip flops. The men looked like it was past their bedtime and they should just go home. Do they even enforce the dress code here??? WTF?! =/ -Funky music. It went from Ludacris one minute to Mr C The Slide Man-Cha Cha Time. Once again...WTF?! What a mood killer.-Small dance floor. IF you even call it a dance floor. I would say more like a "dance space." But like I said, it was a sloooowwww night so my crew and I seemed like we had the space to ourselves.Would I be back here again? Eh...definitely not my first or last choice in nightlife.What a train wreck!!!We received a comped table and comped bottle for Thursday night. When the she came with the bottle she said it was an "automatic $40 service charge". I didn't mind paying for it, just wanted a bill for everything I was paying for. She told me that they don't ever give bills for comped tables. I refused to pay. She said she would get me a bill. She comes back almost an hour later with a REPRINTED receipt from a different group. Scammed for a tip once. Left our table and went to get a hookah at the outside hookah area and the scams just continued. Our coal burnt out after 15 minutes and I asked for another coal or if she could adjust it. She said that it would be 1 coal per hookah all night. I looked at her and said we both know that's ridiculous. She then said "if you tip me, I'll fix it". Ended up tipping her $10 and had to continually ask her for refills and for her to fix the coal. Scammed for a tip twice. My sister went to the car to go her sweater because it was cold. Didn't want to stay inside and partake in the Latin Night so we were outside. Not once did the bouncer tell us that he wasn't allowing re-entry as we waited for her by the door. Not once did he tell her that he wasn't allowing re-entry as he flirted with her when she was leaving to the car. But right as she came back he said "no re-entry. You can tip me and I'll let you back in but $5 isn't gonna cut it!" Wow. This was definitely a sign for us to leave. Blue Martini must be doing really poorly for every single employee to have to scam people for tips all night long.Will I be back?Normally I would stay away from places like this... there's too much Affliction clothing and faux hawks for my taste, I found myself here after we arrived to the Gumball 3000, only to find out it had been cancelled. Blue Martini, has a weird mix of youngish people and people who are on the cusp of being the, "old person at the bar". Walking-in we sat down and were promptly greeted by our server who took our drink order and offered a food menu. We didn't order food, only drinks during our stay. The drinks came quickly and were decently strong. Nothing really mind blowing, but what did semi-explode my mind was the size of this place. We sat on the outdoor patio, which by the way is huge and wraps around the entire restaurant. There's also a separate bar for the patio, which is probably why our drinks came out so quick. There's also two other bar stations inside the venue; as well as a dance floor, dining room area towards the back, and what seemed like private room for party rentals. There was a little bit of sticker shock when the bill the came, but we did enjoy multiple shots, cocktails, and Hookah. Did I have fun? Yes. Would I recommend it?, yes, but only to a certain crowd of friends.Despite being a fan of Ian Fleming's fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond, I've never had a martini until I came here on Sat 10/10th when it was still blue skies and sunny outside, and left happily after dark!We sat outside at a cozy table for 2 on their giant patio, overlooking Town Square below, from a blue skied sunny afternoon until dark. The service was excellent! I tried the Orange Creamsicle Martini which tasted like a delicious alcohol infused ice cream bar.  The Dirty Martini was a must try! Both drinks were very good; although I loved chewing on the large green olives best :-)The upscale atmosphere was classy and fun to be a part of. I could see myself wanting to come here again, despite so many other wonderful restaurants/bars to enjoy drinks "Shaken, not stirred" in Town Square.YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #235I love the iconic blue and red vibe of the entrance of all Blue Martinis.

As is the case with many hidden gems in the Valley, Hot Pot is hidden in a strip mall... it's nothing special to look at (from the outside or the inside), but when you walk in and breathe in the aroma of authentic caribbean cuisine, you know you're in for a treat.I was actually feeling like a simple salad, something light for lunch after stopping by Gangplank last week.  Roger W and Jeff M talked me into joining them for lunch, and how could I be picky when they suggested we try Hot Pot because of their positive Yelp reviews and convenient location?  I couldn't!So, when we walked in and saw the kind lady behind the counter in this "zero decor" restaurant and the menu for the day with only a few items written on a board, I sucked it up and figured "what the hell," just give it a shot!  I'm happy I did!I went with the curry chicken while Roger had a couple of veggie pockets and Jeff, the jerk chicken... It was all tasty - especially once Jeff and I added some hot sauce to ours.  I was happy to get some cabbage on the side of the chicken (and some white rice too), but I was secretly hoping they would offer a salad as well.If you like authentic Caribbean cuisine, check out Hot Pot... don't go in with expectations for anything but the food, and expect an extremely limited menu.  If you do those things, you'll be in for a treat!I definitely love jerk chicken - this is my third review of a restaurant serving jerk chicken. This restaurant is actually the closest to my house - just about a mile away, but I had never been there until I located it on the Yelp mobile app. The restaurant is located in a shopping center, right up front facing Arizona Avenue. Plenty of parking and good seating inside. They had reggae music playing and it was a comfortable environment while waiting. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the jerk chicken to go. She said they also had homemade ginger beer, so I ordered one while waiting on the food. The drink was an immediate strong hit of ginger, but settled into a nice refreshing drink.I ate the chicken when I got home. I ordered it with a side of plantains and rice/peas. She was just baking the plantains when I ordered. Those were the first bite, and they were wonderful! the rice was good, then I went for the chicken. Wow! It was the spiciest I have ever had. Two bites in and my nose was running and I had hiccups. I loved it. It was a good portion and I ate  every bit of it.With this restaurant just down the street and my experience with my first order. I definitely will be back. It would be nice with the spacious seating and good music to sit back with a ginger beer, relax, and eat it there next time. I will definitely be back.

Dessert:The menu claims all desserts are made in house, which immediately caught my attention. I made sure to save room for the Key Lime Pie, it was light, creamy, tangy and delicious. It was my favorite part of the meal.Libations:We ordered a mojito, Dirty Lou and a Shiner. The consensus at the our table after passing drinks around so everybody could taste them, is that the top shelf mojito could have been better, the flavors seemed a little muted. The Dirty Lou, could have been dirtier and the Shiner, while a little out of place in a Cuban restaurant, was really good.Food:We ordered the plantain appetizer, ropa, and two chicken dishes. The appetizer was so good and the spicy black bean spread that came with the order was amazing! Both chicken dishes were really, really good. The ropa was good. It was served luke warm,  which might have distracted from the flavors.Service:We arrived around 8PM on a Saturday night and it seemed they were at the end of their dinner rush. Service was friendly, albeit, not as polished. It seemed that our glasses were always empty before a refill was given.Versus Havana Cafe:Dessert- Babaloos.Appetizers- BabaloosLibations- TieRopa- Havana CafeAtmosphere- Havana CafeSpecialty Dishes- BabalooWe were tossed to the sharks for the one year anniversary event of Babloo's. There were were...mere Yelpers surrounded by the big dogs..the kids who get paid for the game...folks from the professionally published local rags. They were taking notes, smelling their wine milling over what they would write...hey wait..the only difference was I forgot my pen and we do it for free! We Yelpers do it for the love! Put me in coach. I'm ready to play.We opened the night with mojitos that were as lovely as anything i have ever had to drink.Minty...but not too much with just the right amount of sweet.Moving through courses paired perfectly with wines. Even the one wine that I didn't care for on it's own once used as a compliment to the course was very palatable. The food was delicious. Latin flair modern yet traditional. Mint used perfectly throughout. I was particularly fond of the green sauce, and the stuffed tomato was the perfect burst of flavor. And the beef dish was so perfectly prepared....mmm...The band was a perfect mood setter...and Zoe the singer,,if you read this consider it my proposal. Wow.I have a new favorite food. The cake! i am a bad latino...the dulce something or another...ZOMG! I felt slightly inappropriate eating it in public. If Zoe says no to my proposal I will gladly wed the dessert. Not to mention the amazing 40 yr aged rum they served to sip with it.They also sell cigars hand rolled by a true craftsman who was there showing the great care he put into the lovely smokes of which I took two home.I also want to give a special shout out to all of my fellow Yelpers who were there, especially Wes and Tera for the ride and company perfectly paired with a great meal and evening.

Review Text :
It was good. Place seems clean, owner is fun, food was prepped quick and generally tasted pretty good. None of that drowning in heavy gravy boolshit. I liked it. Perhaps not the best Greek inspired food i ever had, but then i am from NYC and LI so..................."I like"So I'm retransitioning to veganism (read Skinny Bitch/Skinny Bastard for more info) and I wouldn't say this is a vegan friendly place in any way. But I tried the salad with tomatos, feta, pecans, and green leafy substance and it was really, really, really tasty. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Poor Richard Z. did not have the same luck with his beef sandwich thing. When I ordered it the owner said it was the best decision I've ever made. Well, I don't know about that... But it was certainly a very good one. He's also gave us a free Red Bull cola, which on its own merits is eh, but I very much appreciated the gesture. Cool guy. Overall, if you want to support a small business with very tasty salads, and you're near Chandler Blvd and the 101, and you don't mind that there wasn't a single female customer in the joint, this is definitely a place to consider.

Disclaimer: I didn't try the sushi. I didn't need to.The wife and I actually came here because they were advertising 1 cent bottles of beer. Goes to show you our priorities... Anyway we walk into this fine establishment to find the penny beers waiting for us. Typical Bud Light/Miller Light, but who cares! They're a penny!They ambience is great. Low light, quiant booths with a bar on one side. When I use the word quaint, I don't mean small. Yes, it IS small, but it is a very pleasant small.Well, I've been on a quest to find all the yummy ramens of the valley.  Lo and behold, whats on their menu? You got it! Ramen.  Chicken or Beef or Seafood or Spicy Bonzai, you can't go wrong.  I got the beef with the Udon noodles and I SWEAR to you... they brought out a GALLON of soup. A GALLON! There wasn't much to it, but it was tasty.  Noodles, sprouts, seasoned broth, and beef.  We also ordered a plate of the Honey Chicken and it DIDN'T disappoint.  It was twice the size of PeiWei's similar dish, and MUCH tastier.  With it, came a dish of white rice.This place was right under my nose.  I will definitely be back! I want to try the spicy Bonzai ramen.  They say if you can eat 2 bowls, its free! That would be... 2 Gallons of soup.

If you're staying at Bally's, had a long, but exciting night, and in dire need some some food to munch on without table service, Nosh is there for the rescue!It was my last night during my last visit to Vegas and by that time I really wasn't in the mood to go to a sit-down restaurant, nor travel far to grab some food elsewhere.  I was tired but luckily Nosh was there thanks to them being open 24 hours a day.  They have some really good specials like their $3 Hot Dogs and $12 Foot Long Sandwiches.   I ordered their Large Italian Sandwich and as you can see, this sandwich was loaded!! (http://bit.ly/1yLBvZS).  The bread was good and they definitely piled in the meat.  It definitely hit the spot for me before calling it a night.For being open 24 hours and offering a nice selection of sandwiches and snacks, Nosh is a dependable spot if you're staying at Bally's.

I struggled a lot on whether to give this a 3 or a 4. Honestly, I'm not happy with my decision and I'm thinking it may deserve a 3. This place is new to me, but I'm no stranger to "Mongolian BBQ" as I've been a long-time fan of YC's. Obviously I'm going to compare the two. I liked that they had fresh meat, but it was a little fatty and since they use thicker chunks as opposed to shaved and frozen, it takes longer to cook your food. They seem to stack up orders on the hot disc. It definitely lacks the flair you get when eating at YC's, but the novelty of that wears off after a few times anyway. Plus, I know it's wrong, but I prefer the frozen shaved meats to these chunks. It's just different though - I wouldn't say frozen is better, just that I prefer it. I would even go so far as to say I preferred a lot of their fixin's outside of the meat. They had a better selection of spicy powders and sauces than YC's, and this place definitely caters to the spicy food lover more. They also had better vegetables. I should also mention they have a better selection of meats including two types of beef and even shrimp and scallops. Even your choices of noodles and rice was more extensive. Come to think of it, they really beat the shit out of YC's hands down in the available food department.And taste? Well, it was delicious I must say. Of course, I assembled the dish, so if it wasn't any good I have to accept at least part of the blame if not all. If I had to compare, I'd say YC's is very reliable and good consistantly because I tend to always create roughly the same dish. GG's I could see having a much broader range of flavors and experiences. The ambiance was okay for a strip-mall restaurant. It was kinda kitschy, but charming enough and fairly comfy. They had attention to detail. I think YC's (depending on which one you go to) is a "no frills" sort of place compared to this. They were piping in some good contemporary alternative music as well... for a minute, I thought someone had lifted my ipod.Service was attentive, but odd since this is a "get your own food" kind of place... They also have menus which is strange considering you basically put your own dish together and since the server explains the process again to you in detail. I felt a bit like a child being explained something so simple and obvious, but my girlfriend had a confused look on her face, so maybe it's a good thing they do that. Regulars probably just get escorted over to the line.I think my main gripe with it was the tiny bowl they gave me for the fixin's... but then again, you aren't putting noodles or rice in there like you do at YC's - they add that as they cook it for you. So I suppose the portions are comparable. Then there's the price. A little high perhaps - maybe higher than YC's (I know they used to be 5 bucks for a lunch bowl). But you do get a lot for your money if you know how to pack the food in the bowl. So I guess I was right to give it a 4 instead of a 3... turns out I really liked it. I think this would be a real treat for someone who hasn't had Mongolian BBQ before. I consider this to be a great alternative to YC's... Impressive.This is in response to the condescending owner of Genghis Grill.  Unfortunely for you, I'm a bit more educated than your average diner.  I am a registered dietitian and I am smart enough to know the your comments on my initial review are misleading to your other customers.  First off, I have a 30 minute lunch break therefore I dont have time to drive to your restaurant and sit there for 45 minutes.  But I understand many people have 1 hour lunch breaks and they may have time for your restaurant.  This is why I chose YC's because I can get in and out of there on my time schedule.Your goober sauces are more unhealthy than most sauces with the consistancy of water.  The only way sauces get that thick consistency is being made with excessive sugar and/or fat just like BBQ sauce and mayo.  Anyone who knows anything about nutrition and asian dishes should know that "Kung Pao" sauce is one of the most calorically dense sauces.  This goes for any asian restaurant not just YC's- along with other thick sauces like General Tso and Sweet & Sour.  I could really care less about these YC's recipes considering I always make my own as many people do.   I do not want a place that pre-makes the sauces for me.Your comparison is clearly ridiculous considering the portion size you are comparing must be dramatically different.  YC's does not specify a serving size.  Neither do you!  Genghis Grill Serving Size = 0.5 ,1, or 2.  What does this mean????? g? oz? tsp? tbs? cup?  Not exactly what I'd call legitimate.   YC's charges .50 cents for a take-out box not $1.  I was charged 9.99 for lunch on a weekday for a to-go order.  So if your lunch is supposed to cost 8.99 well then you do the math.You only solidified my decision to NEVER GO BACK with your rude response.  I have only ever rated a restaurant with 1 star twice.  I usually rate generously.  My initial review was my honest opinion.  I had nothing against Genhis Grill- it just wasn't for me.  Now that you have responded this way- I will now go to the extent to letting friends and coworkers about the situation.  I'm sure you will stay busy but I will not be visiting again.Typical Mongolian BBQ grill - you get a (smallish) bowl, choose your proteins, veggies, sauces, and starches, then hand them over for cooking. They bring the finished dish to your table. I chose chicken, salmon, scallops, a variety of vegetables,  a curry sauce, and rice noodles. The resulting dish was OK, a bit on the bland side; perhaps this is because I didn't take as much sauce as I should have. The staff is friendly and helpful, but the queue at the ingredients trays moves slowly.

After reading many reviews on Yelp and driving past this joint 100's of times, I finally decided to stop by today for lunch to check it out myself.  I decided to give myself a treat after a great workout at the gym.....have to give back some of the calories, right?I had no idea how it worked and the menu in the restaurant is posted at the front door facing your back when you enter...so you see it when you exit.....what the hell?  Seems very illogical to me, but whatever.  Because I didn't see the menu when I walked in, I had no idea what to do....so I asked the kid at the register, how does this work?  He kind of looked at me with a puzzled expression and said "You place an order and I take it"......he was kidding around and explained that there are specialty Burgers that I can choose from or I can "Create" my own.  You choose 1/4, 1/3, or 1/2 lb patties, the bread, and the toppings.After browsing the specialty Burgers for a minute, I decided I wanted to order two of them.  I ordered a 1/4 lb Dali Burger  with White Bread & (Avocado, Peppers, Onions, Monterey Jack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, & Southwestern Ranch) and a 1/4 lb Impressionist Burger with Onion Bread & (Cajun Seasoning, Jalapenos, Lettuce, Tomato, Pepper Jack, & Atomic Mayo w/side of BBQ Sauce) and a bottle of Water.  He suggested that I get a side of BBQ Sauce with the Impressionist Burger....I took him up on his recommendation.  Total damage ($11.73), for the Burgers & bottled Water.  The price you see on the menu is the combo price.  He issued me a number and my change and told me they would bring out the Burgers when it was ready.The restaurant has plenty of seating and nice comfortable booths....not what I expected.  They also sell Frozen Custard here....since I'm unfamiliar with what that is, I passed on trying it this visit.After a few minutes my order was delivered by the manager.  He apologized because they ran out of Guacamole and substituted it with whole Avocado on the Dali Burger....I told him that was fine.  I started to take pics of the food and when he saw me, he asked if I wanted a picture with the Burger....I laughed and said yes.  What a nice guy.I jumped into the Impressionist Burger first.....I couldn't wait to try it since it was loaded with Spicy Toppings.....I decided to take the first bite without the BBQ Sauce.  Wow....it was Spicy!  It had a very nice kick to it....not too blazing hot, but very enjoyable.  I am impressed because most joints make their mild....not this one!  Then I tried it with the BBQ Sauce per the cashier kid's advice.....yum!  The BBQ Sauce combined with the spicy flavor of the Atomic Mayo, Jalapenos, and Pepper Jack made this burger taste really good.  I wish I would have ordered a 1/3 lb patty though as the 1/4 lb seemed to be too small with all of the toppings.  The Beef was very flavorful, but I could have used more of it...next time I'll get the 1/3 or 1/2 lb patty....my bad.After devouring the Impressionist, I went for the Dali Burger.  I loaded the Avocados into the Burger and again took a bite before I tried it with the Southwest Ranch Sauce.....it was pretty good, but needed the Ranch.  I poured some of the Ranch with each subsequent bite.....wow, another excellent Burger!  The Onion Bun added to it.....another great recommendation from the cashier kid....he must eat a ton of their Burgers to figure out great combinations of stuff.Overall, it was a good experience....fresh, flavorful ingredients and the ability to customize your Burger are the highlights of this place.  The one knock would be the Bread....it was very "doughy" and just didn't do it for me.....tasted like and had the consistency of Wonder Bread.  Despite that flaw, I still gave it 4 Stars.Will I return?  I want to try some of the other specialty burgers as well as up the patty size....so, yeah I will be returning soon!

Restaurant name  The Keg Steakhouse + Bar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Sorry to anyone who likes this place, but The Keg is a big, fat disappointment - just like the parties with the same name always were back in college. To be fair, we only went for happy hour, but the specialty drink we tried and the appetizer we ordered were both really gross. In my opinion, a restaurant needs to make a good impression at the bar because a lot of people, myself included, try places out by ordering a drink and appetizer or two. Given how bad what we tried was, what incentive do we have for returning for a bigger meal? From the outside, The Keg looks like your run-of-the-mill steakhouse; once we got inside, however, we were shocked at how sleek and upscale the decor was. The bathrooms, in particular, were gorgeous and super-clean. When we went to sit at the bar, we were expecting some really classic cocktails and satisfying appetizers. The happy hour drink special was an orange martini, so I thought I'd try it. My husband got a Heineken (1/2 off during happy hour), which can't be messed up. To eat, we ordered the sliders, which were $9.95; they didn't have any happy hour food specials. The martini was really sweet and tasted like it didn't have a drop of alcohol in it; it kind of reminded me of Sunny-D, which I hated growing up and now wouldn't serve to children if you paid me. The sliders were even worse. They were supposed to be prime-rib sliders, but I would have rather had ground chuck. The meat was chewy and fatty and reminded us of the sausage in an Egg McMuffin (which I like but wasn't expecting on a slider). There were also no toppings like onion or tomato - just a sauce or piece of cheese on each one. Instead of fries on the side, there were just measly little fried onions. Blech. We could have gone to Ruby Tuesday's right next door and gotten better sliders! In the end, we didn't spend more than $22 or so, but being a happy hour fanatic, I know that there are plenty of other places (Latitude 30 is a notable example) where we could go and spend the same amount and get some great appetizers and drinks. We definitely won't be back.3 girls on a thursday night decided steak sounded necessary.as two of us waited for the 3rd girl to arrive our waiter stops by and says 'when is your friend getting here? i don't want to explain the menu a bunch of times.'uh ok.we ordered the bacon wrapped scallops to start. believe it or not it was my FIRST TIME having scallops! I am not a big seafood eater but I would eat these again. tasty. while we browsed the menu trying to make a selection the waiter came by and was like 'will you close your menu when you're ready so that i don't have to keep coming by your table?' blank stares from us. seriously? wtf? we're chatty girls wanting to enjoy a nice, not rushed dinner. he pops by again and asks if we're ready. thankfully one of my friends has more balls than me and says 'my menu is still open and i'm following your rules so...' and he walked away.we closed our menus to signal our waiter and we ordered escargot, prime rib, salads, soup etc.the escargot was another first for me! it was tasty but i wouldn't order it again. glad i tried it though! my prime rib was ok, definitely not the best i've ever had. we also ordered the creme brulee and it was good...nothing amazing. while this was a place of many first for me, it will be my first and last time visiting bc of the rude waiter.  the prices aren't worth the food and service.I have been back 3 times since my last visit and can easily say my last experience isn't the norm. And I haven't seen that waiter since so perhaps he found a job outside of customer service?? I talked to the manager and they were so amazing at handling the situation. Seriously major kudos! I probably wouldn't have been back if it weren't for them and it's now become a spot we frequent. The service has been great ever since as well. The last 2 times I went I had the pecan crusted steak which is great. My friends all swear by the French onion soup and order it everytime. I'll have to try it next time.We came in recently again as a group for a going away party for one of my BFFs. We ordered 3 desserts- the crème brulee, the coffee ice cream pie and the brownie sundae. BEST BROWNIE SUNDAE. We all ended up not really even finishing the other desserts because they didn't even compare to that one. So this is what you should order:French onion souppecan crusted steakbrownie sundaeI wonder how their steak is here but don't EVER come here for happy hour with a big group. No joke. I came here the other day with a pretty big group for happy hour. The service was horrible, the food and drinks were mediocre. For drinks, I ordered the Orange Slice to start. It was a martini but tasted like a screwdriver with a splash of vodka. My second drink was the Pinot Noir. This one I liked. For food, we ordered the crab cakes, nachos and baked brie. The cheese on the nachos was really dry and didn't taste very fresh to me. I actually liked the baked brie. The cheese and pesto that it came with was really good. Service.. I've never been a waitress and I understand we were with a big group but I would think you would go around the whole group asking what everyone wanted. Plus there were 2-3 waitresses helping with our group. Never once did that happen. We basically had to flag down the waitress every time we wanted to order something. On top of that, we asked her for the happy hour menu maybe 3 times or more and she never once brought it. We ended up talking to the manager who eventually brought the menu and told him we were very disappointed in the service. We got an apology. I would've thought he could've at least gave us a small discount on the bill, or something complimentary. Anything. Nope. I won't be back for happy hour.

So, unfortunately my lack of stars reflects the service, not the food- but only because the awful attitude we received truly made it hard to enjoy my bagel. Being from the US and knowing no French, we accidentally ordered bagels at the to-go counter and then wished to sit down. When we asked for plates, we got such a sigh and eye roll. We weren't trying to avoid a fee, tipping, or cheat the system. We were simply mistaken, and had we been corrected we'd have been happy to correct whatever it was that had upset this waitress so much.  Instead, we were given plates and knives with disdain and felt awkward as we tried to enjoy our bagels.Trust me, I would have preferred my bagel toasted! Had I understood how things worked I would have done it right. I would encourage staff to be a bit more patient. We never got any explanation of how to get seated service, so we were at a loss.Bottom line: for those who want the full bagel experience and are from out of town, don't walk up to the to-go counter by accident! However, I'll be darned if I know what you're SUPPOSED to do! Someone local might want to chime in and let those pesky tourists know! We'd love to be in the loop!

Everyone always goes on about Romados this and Romado's that (granted, I'm guilty of it too), but if you're craving some seriously scrumptious and authentic Portuguese grill, you owe it to yourself to visit Jano. Whether you're starting simple with the quarter chicken combo, or swinging for the big leagues with their five meat plate (for two), you are guaranteed to leave with a smile on your face. All the proteins are prepared to perfection: squid, rabbit, duck, lamb chops, chicken... these guys are seriously masters of the grill. A simple salad and fries round out the plate.And if you're feeling bold, go ham on the hot sauce. But be warned, they are not messing around with that weak shit. This is some serious hotness.

Ahhh...the lingering country club lunches at Phil's Grill. Those were the days. When I lived in the white, homogenized and frankly, boring, world called DCRanch, I often met up with my roomie at Phil's. Sort of the anti Zipp's sports bar. Of course there are the obligatory plasma tvs. The views of the course are great as you nestle into a comfie sofa . I felt like the old farts in the movie Trading Places. We'd sit in those big leather chairs by the fireplace and count our money. Once, I counted $27 in one pocket alone! The food here is fantastic, as it should be for a mogul like myself. Favorites include the Sonoran chicken pasta with fresh grilled corn, the prime rib slider (how old  money is that?!) and the Southwestern wrap. The menu does include high end steaks running up to $37 or so. I would have ordered that. But was unable to find another $10 in my other pockets.

Nice place for what a pizza place has to offer.$8.95 for a Balsamic Grilled Chicken Salad (that can feed 2 if your ordering pizza etc.) You can get the $14.95 plate. Maybe that feeds 4?$9.95 for the Margherita: Roma Tomatoes, Garlic, Fresh Basil.Tasty good. Asked for extra garlic didn't seem to make it on this order. Or it could be the Garlic Cheese Bread ($5.95) was head & shoulders more "garlicy" so the pizza paled in comparison?Before, I have tasted some left over Thai Chicken pizza that was in the fridge at home, it was very tasty. Will try it fresh out the oven eventually. The Messy Sundae ($8.50)My visit was for a B-Day. (FREE they said on B-Day) This is a Very Tall (stands what looked like 1-1/2 ft.) sundae glass cascading with chocolate over a couple of scoops of icecream.It was fine finish to the stay!Mixed bag as far as customers go, the retired, the first date, the small family, even a table of kids babysitting themselves. Kids Menu available.Wait staff is on it. Lets call this a Pizza Restaurant with polished details and an upscale menu. Check it out. 3 other Las Vegas location with another opening soon S.Rainbow. And 10 more in SoCal.Only thing I noticed, at least for this time of year, the Sun crashes through the windows from off to the left. So be aware. They have blinds but I noticed that those annoying little streaks still get through for some time.I'll check it out again and get better layout details. for ya'all.-------------------------------------------------------------------------6/10/08Back again.Kids wars. Cell Phone wars. wtf!?Salad was nice again.Thia Chicken Pizza was good indeed.Of all things to order someone got a Pepperoni. Looked like shit. Kinda pooled up some oil. Yay, lunch tomorrow. I guess if you stick with things that you can't get at Pizza Hut your ok here. Duck Tacos for one.........next time, next timeCame for Happy Hour which is 4-6 daily now. Half off tapas and drinks (wine and beer)...only beer that was sounding decent was Sierra Nevada so skipped out this time. One nice surprise too is for the month of April Favorites and New Stuff are half off also (4 kinds of new pizza- tuscan, caprese, sicilian, diavola and 1 artisan type- feta, ahi sliders, chicken chile tacos, kobe chili, white tuna salad).Had mini duck tacos- these were so cute! They were good too though...nice bbq flavor on the duck and like the feta with it.Tuscan pizza- prosciutto, artichoke, olives, arugula. It was pretty good but with prosciutto and olives it made it a tad too salty and kinda made all the rest of the food salty.Ahi sliders- one of my favorite things here...3 sliders and comes with seasoned fries and a pickle. Pretty good patty, slightly spicy.Not too much beer selection, but they do have some Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Decent, fresh, goes with everything we're eating.Service was good..never had to ask for another drink and I'm a thirsty one needing several refills of ice tea! Best all- this is like a few blocks away from the house so good to drop in for HH.I've come in a few times for Happy Hour tapas- they're pretty good and you can't beat the price. One note I wanted to put is that I had the Lebni cheese tonight. I like their flatbread and I like soft cheeses and Mediterranean spices... they put a spice mix on the cheese and all over the bread. I shook the bread and a lot of spices fell off so I would maybe recommend to just get spices on the cheese and tell them to skip the bread since apparently it is the norm to throw on that much spice mix. They replaced it with a new one right away. Got some duck tacos which are always good. Braised asparagus with Romano shavings, balsamic and prosciutto- perfectly cooked veggie. I eat a lot of "real" Italian food and this is something we definitely would have at dinner since it's clean fresh, simply done flavors.Service has always been decent here so I don't have any big complaints about this location.

Ugh! After an afternoon spent at home depot picking out doors and faucets for our first house, my lovely and I had worked up an appetite.  We knew we wanted a patio, probably a brew, some lunch and a comfy table to discuss the handful of paint swatches we had in tow.  So, Tempe was the answer until on our way there we noticed this retro looking hamburger joint with a Miller High-life banner hanging in the window.  We decided to skip the drive and go for it, there was even a patio.We walked up and the first thing we saw was a freaky mannequin dressed in a stripper/"nurse" outfit placed in the window of the 500 sq ft building.  As soon as we entered the front door, it became clear that the mannequin wasn't the only one sporting this skimpy attire.  The waitresses also had on cheeky skirts, white fishnets, and boobs popping out of their blouses.  This was a sorry attempt as the class of the place left me feeling like I was at some Mesa dive bar, or better yet Band-Aids with burgers.  Creepy men were scattered throughout the tiny place drooling.  Just when I thought it couldn't get any stranger (or funnier!) I spotted the makeshift  bulletin board of the waitresses (all 2 of them) with 50+ pictures of them complete with handwritten captions, and numerous old creepy men like the ones there that afternoon.  It was hard for to believe this place was real, or that someone actually took it seriously!With grumbling bellies and confused looks on our faces we decided to order a couple of PBR's (either PBR or High-life the only 2 choices of brew), and took it to the cement patio.  After a brief glance at the one page menu: Hamburger, double, hot-dog, or fries, we decided to chug our 3 buck beers and find another lunch spot.Summing it all up, my bf said to me "I'm sure the burgers would've been good, I would just never eat there", followed by "Hey, they're just trying to make a buck".  Try harder...What a waste of a great location.I didn't come here for the anorexic Asian or the brunette who lacked personality. I didn't come here because they show off their rib cages.. I came here to eat. The place is a gimmick inside a gimmick. They only offer PBR and Miller High Life. Their sodas are in bottles, with the Coke being Mexican glass bottled coke, which as we all know is fuckin' delicious. The menu consists of Single 1/2 lb. burger, Double, Triple, hot dog, french fries or onion rings. The burgers start at $8, going up $2 increments for every towering patty added. Fries or Rings are extra. The god damn burgers are  monstrous. With a double being probably 6" tall. But the Chef in me was a little puzzled at the timing of the food. The cook must of been bending the laws of thermodynamics because I got 1 lb. of cooked ground beef that was hot mind you, in 8 minutes. That tells me that they have the burgers "sandbagged" in the back. (Sandbag is a culinary term for partially cooked and ready to go.)The burger comes dressed with chili, American and Swiss cheese, and tomatoes. I paid $14 for coke, Double Burger and order of fries. Not "too" bad. Tax is included in the prices. I'd come back again, with my Ol' man. The food is guy food and the flagrant arm touches the 19 year old servers dish out is enough to keep my old man breathing another day...

Review Text :
My wife found out about this place through Mixi which is kind of like a Japanese myspace.  Its only been open for 3 weeks and we've wanted to try another izakaya style place besides Ichiza (which was packed for Memorial Day) so we gave this place a go.The place is a bit small, not great for groups of over 4 but the atmosphere wasn't bad.  I guess I prefer Jpop over koto music but it was fine.  Their specialty is their yakitori (grilled on a stick) type stuff.  We went w/ the chicken thigh ($2 a piece), wasabi kobe beef ($9), asparagus bacon ($2) and the tsukune which is grilled ground chicken on a stick.  Everything we had tasted awesome.  Not sure what they're putting in their grill for the flavoring but its fantastic and addictive.  You can definitely tell that the ingredients used here are of higher quality than Ichiza but the menu is a lot smaller and aside from the yakitori, pricier too.  Ofcourse we weren't full from all the above so we tried some of the rice dishes along with oden (a winter food boiled in a soup..kinda like a hot pot).  My wife got the Tororo don which is gooey potato mixed w/ soy sauce that she loves but I find inedible while I had the ikura don which is salmon roe eggs w/ seaweed on rice.  Both of these cost around $10 a piece and the portions were pretty small.  Just one small bowl of rice w/ the topping.  Definitely disappointed w/ that.  My wife was also bummed that they didn't have natto.  The oden was tasty though.  We ordered the chikuwa (fish stick), konnyaku and daikon which were all around $1.50-$2 a piece.They only have Sapporo beer but they do have a nice list of sake, shochu and wines which would make this a nice place for some beverages and small food.  I would also recommend just buying the pitcher of beer at $22 a pop as opposed to the $5 glass if your party plans on drinking at least 4 glasses.  You get a WHOLE lot more w/ the pitcher!!!!!  The bathroom was funny too as they only have a single unisex stall but they put a bunch of fake flowers on the ceiling w/ a speaker playing bird noises the entire time.  Priceless.  Overall, I would rate this place 3.5 stars but its closer to 4 than 3.   I am just sticking to the grilled stuff the next time we go back as the rice dish portions are way too overpriced.  A few tables ordered the deep juicy fried chicken ($8) which looked awesome too so maybe we'd get that next time.  They're open til 3am which is cool.  Most patrons there were Japanese..I think I was 1 out of 3 that weren't. So yeah..this is a good alternative to Ichiza although I wouldn't say its better...just different.Wow, just wow.  We've been living in Vegas for years now, and to have a place this good that's not attached to some casino (and hence overpriced or blown out of proportion) is just fantastic.The place is small and intimate.  It can only hold about 30 people at the most, but any wait you have to deal with is worth it for the food.  The wait staff themselves were very nice, friendly, and knowledgeable on the dishes.One of the standouts was the Tofu Special ($9).  I am a dyed-in-the-wool carnivore, but that's a dish that I could easily eat several times a week and not miss a burger.  It's homemade Tofu, fried a bit, then served in a fantastic broth with a smattering of hot sauce on the bowl's rim for you to use with each bite.  You'll want to drink up the broth it's so tasty!Other standouts (although everything was good) were the Kobe skewer, the spicy peppers, the hot chicken appetizer (chicken in crispy chicken skin), and the asparagus wrapped in bacon.  For desert, they had a strawberry sorbet that's not listed on the menu, which was also excellent.We got there right around opening (6 PM) and it was already half full.  What another reviewer said is true -- people take their time in here, so make a reservation if you're over a party of two!My wife and I decided that if we just wanted an amazing desert, we'd hit Ichiza for the Honey Toast.  However. for anything else, Raku is where it's at!Raku has been getting quite a buzz from the Las Vegas community, especially because it's one of those off-the-strip type places meant just for locals.  It's a Japanese restaurant that specializes more in yakitori and street food.  (As other have mentioned, they do offer some sashimi, but that's not why you come here.)With a party of four, we got to try a bunch of different things:* Raku's Tofu ($4) - Highly recommended by our waiter since he said they are the only one in Vegas that makes their own.  It's uniquely presented as a homemade tofu and comes with sides of grated ginger, scallions, and bonito shavings.  The texture and taste can be a bit surprising at first as it's definitely not your commercial tofu. But once you add a bit of the sides, and a little soy, it tastes pretty good actually.* Sea Urchin and Seaweed with Soup ($4) - Presented in an individual bowl, two coils of uni rest on a bed of seaweed in a light broth.  The uni was good, and a bit different because of the warmth of the broth.  I enjoyed this dish and would get it again.* Daikon Radish and Soft Fish Cake Oden ($1.50/pp) - Their Oden menu consists of ordering individual pieces and they are all placed together as they have been stewing.  The daikon was less than memorable, something I wouldn't have ordered on my own nor again.  The fish cake was good though, although not something I particularly crave.  The side of hot wasabi mustard adds some much needed heat and taste to this dish.  Definitely use it.* Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi ($9/pp) - Expensive, but good.  Depending on how the wasabi hits your mouth, it can be a shot up your nose or an enjoyable piece of meat.* Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic ($6) - The crispy slices of fried garlic is what makes this beef really good.  I think it's actually tastier than the Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi.* Chicken Breast wrapped with Chicken Skin ($2.50/pp) - Chicken breast is always boring to me, but what makes this enjoyable would probably be the fatty chicken skin.  The Big F enjoyed this, but it's not something I would order again.* Chicken Wing ($1.50) - I personally didn't get a taste, but the guys in my party enjoyed it.* Grilled Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce ($4) - The duck was very tasty and had a nice sauce to it.  Cooked well and enjoyable.* Mushroom Wrapped with Bacon ($2/pp) - Mushroom and bacon, need I say more? Good stuff.* Kurobuta Pork Cheeks ($2.50) - This is really good stuff, really fatty bad for you stuff I'm sure, but really good!  Eat it when it's hot!* Enoki Mushroom Wrapped in Bacon ($2.50) - The enoki adds a slightly different taste and texture that makes it really enjoyable to eat.  Both the bottom and top of the mushroom are texturally different as well.* Ground Chicken Portabella ($3.50) - Grilled portabellas are always good, add some chicken and seasonings and you can't go wrong. * Lamb Chop ($5) - The waiter claimed their lamb chops were fabulous and had people returning just for them. And I do admit, they were really good.  Nicely cooked to a medium rare and juicy!* Grilled Rice Ball ($5 for two) - The soy sauce grilled rice ball is tastier than the rice ball wrapped in the green leaf, so we ordered just this one.  We tried ordering the Potato with Corn ($2.50), but they just ran out, same for the Foie Gras ($12).  They have daily specials that sound interesting, but be sure to ask about the price.Service was okay.  With about three wait staff people, I had to ask for my tea to be refilled almost every single time.  (They should have just left the pot for me after my fourth refill.)  They also never bothered refilling our water.  With all the sodium, liquids were necessary!The menu is simple, but can be a bit overwhelming your first time there.  We found the whole Oden (Dashi Broth Pot) menu to be a bit daunting with the per piece charge and probably wouldn't have ordered anything from here if it were just the Big F and I.  The Robata Grill menu is where it's all out.  However, since they charge per skewers, you'll end up ordering the $28 Kobe Beef Steak and not realize it!  Their Rice/Noodle/Soup menu sounds good, but worries me when I read "Bite Size Salmon Roe Bowl" for $10.  Is it really bite-size?In regards to the bathroom, I didn't see what the big deal was.  Sure, it's aesthetically pleasing with bird sounds and fake flowers.   But nothing worth making a special visit out of it.  It's a new restaurant and a new bathroom, therefore it's clean!As recommended, make reservations.  It wasn't really necessary last Friday evening when we went, but it does fill up and people do take their time.  So I would definitely try to make reservations if my party is more than two.  Overall, we did enjoy our experience here, but found it to be quite expensive.  $150 for 4, including tip and tax, with no alcohol seems a bit costly.  (None of us were 'full' since we headed over to Luv-It's for dessert!)3.5 stars.(Pics posted!)This is Vegas' saving grace when it comes to Asian food.  I'll bet on Raku anytime against any Japanese restaurant in the United States...  that's how AWESOME Raku is!I showed up at midnight on my way home from a restaurant Sunday night.  I've heard of Raku for a long time and I thought I'd at least go check out where it is.  I found it, it was empty, so I walked in.  I might as well have stepped across the Pacific Ocean when I crossed that entrance.  It was a different world.Kani, the sashimi chef and condiment mixologist, greeted me.  Rei, the restaurant manager, joined in and I sat myself at the bar.  I was full, but I could sense it wasn't your ordinary late night restaurant -- it was magical -- and I wanted to stay.  So I ordered a beer, one for Kani, one for me.  I chatted with him and Rei about Vegas and random stuff.Kani is a world traveler, having worked in San Francisco, New York, Hong Kong and now Vegas.  His friend, 10 years his junior, opened Raku and invited him to join in the operation as they worked together when they were back in New York.  He likes Vegas, though he doesn't think much of his local competitors in Japanese food.  The only alcoholic drink he'll drink is beer because he is at work.  He'll tell you what's fresh, so just ask.  He mixes the sauces in the restaurant himself...  and let me tell you, they are great condiments to the grilled skewers.There's a mild but complex soy sauce that is a blend of different types of soy sauce and other mixtures, one of which is green tea.  There is a chili pepper blend that has a nice bite to it and a pepper soaked in some blend that is making my mouth water as I recall topping my kurobuta pork cheeks with it last night.  The salt has ground green tea mixed in.  There is a careful level of attention paid to every level of culinary experience at this place.At that time, the restaurant was empty.  It reminded me of that painting, Nighthawks at the Diner, though Raku is nothing like that diner in that painting.  Raku is very intimate and elegantly decorated inside.  Dark lit...  it had a retro / nostalgic feel to it.  The fact that it was empty must have been because it was late and the economy is really hurting...  but Kani says they still get a late night rush before they close.  They're really busy from when they open at 6 pm to 11 pm -- so if you want to chat with the chef or staff, come late.I never imagined I can have this good quality food late at night.  I always thought I'd have to resort to IHOP or some other gastronomic compromise -- but with Raku, you get good quality, late night food and good company.  It's your Vegas Japanese Cheers.  Three cheers for Raku!Banzai!  Banzai!  Banzai!Amy C. I must thank you.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  You were the last droplets of water in my canteen that got me across the desert and showed me safe passage through Las Vegas, and helped me avoid the massive amount buffet food and pricey celebrity chef endorsed restaurants that line the strip.  I never expected to find, Japanese food that would not only cure my cravings, but also cure my homesickness of living out of a suitcase in a hotel.We ordered quite a bit of items, and reviewing my photos, we came  pretty close to about 17 dishes between the three of us, and boy we left full!  I enjoyed each dish that came out but I will highlight a few that were so good, that they almost knocked me out of my seat. The Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe was from the cold appetizer section, what more could you ask for, three eggs from three different animals are in this dish, throw in nameko mushrooms, and thin slices of okra in a light soy based sauce, you get a dish with an amazing texture.  I'm sure it the type of texture that can horrify some people who aren't used to it, because of the slimy texture that all these ingredients bring to the table, but just by pouring this on our rice, the flavors, the textures it all worked.  I grew up with this texture, and I was instantly swept up in waves of nostalgia from my childhood as I ate this dish.  I loved this dish.The Fried Homemade Tofu in Hot Broth, agedashi dofu is another dish that I love.  And I've had great ones, and quite a few not so great ones, but this one was delicious, it had the consistency and texture you can only get from homemade tofu, additionally, they choose to keep it in a larger block rather then to cut it into smaller cubes for the purpose of allowing you to actually be able to taste the tofu, with the crispy fried batter, swimming in a tentsuyu broth with green onion, salmon roe and nameko mushrooms.  Yaki onigiri was great and I liked how they did the traditional soy sauce one, but then did another one sandwiched in between shiso leaves and a little miso paste.  The only little critique I had on the soy sauce one was I wished they cooked it on the robata grill a little longer, I do like to getting a little char on it and I love to munch on the little crispy bits of rice on my onigiri.  But that is just a personal preference of mine.  Grilled Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce - The duck was perfectly cooked, it had a little color inside and the balsamic soy sauce provided a nice seasoning and acidity to the dish.Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi - I had this in a few steakhouses back in Japan.  It took me back.Potato with Corn - This dish perplexed me and all of my dinner companions.  It was delicious, but more so we were in deep conversation during the consumption of this and for the duration of our trip, "How in the world did he do this?"  We have a couple of ideas in principal, but how the person who did this and executed it so flawlessly, we are honestly still at a loss.  I think just order it, try it and you will see what we were on about. For dessert we the sorbet flavors of the day, they had a Mandarin Sorbet and Watermelon Sorbet.  I would probably have to say that their sorbet had larger ice crystals, (leading to a texture more similar to a granita siciliana) compared to a sorbet which has smaller ice crystals creating a much smoother texture.  Definitions of texture aside, both sorbets were very good and was a nice way to cleanse the pallet.  We also ordered the Meltin' and Creamy Chocolate Cake, on our server's recommendation, they make this one to order and they need at least 15-20 minutes to make this dessert, we were in no rush, we were enjoying our meal.  It was basically a molten chocolate cake, and with our first cut with the spoon, it gushed out.  The cake was dense and moist, with the molten fudge inside, and a little green tea ice cream, which complemented the dessert.Overall, I wouldn't have expected to find a restaurant like this all the way out in Vegas.  We came for a late dinner, so we had no line, but now that I know that they serve food like this, it's going to be worth the wait.  Now if you are the type of person where the words "all you can eat" or "the world's biggest" sounds appealing, I'm not sure this is the place for you.  But if you like a little variety, and enjoy eating in a tapas style (little plates), believe me, you will leave here full and very satisfied... added bonus you don't have to win big in Vegas to eat here, prices for what you get are extremely reasonable.  This hidden gem, requires a car or taxi to get off the beaten path in Las Vegas but it was worth the effort.  I can't wait to go back.  (I already have a wish list on things I want to try next time....)Thank you Amy C.!  You saved me.Forget Korean tacos, hello Japanese tapas!This was one of my favorite meals in Sin City and it was off the strip, tucked in a mini-mall. I was surprised at how hot this restaurant was on Yelp because it was tiny and unpretentious... unlike the rest of LV. We had the: - Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe- Fried Homemade Tofu in Hot Broth- Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi- Kurobuta Pork Cheek- Foie Gras- Enoki Mushroom Wrapped with Bacon- Cold Udon Noodle with Foie Gras Custard Soup- Fluffy CheesecakeEverything was small but incredibly flavorful. All the meats danced and melted on my tongue. You know a restaurant is a winner when it can charge $10 for tofu and I can leave without bitching, whining, or crying. The only item that I wouldn't order again is the cheesecake, but then again--I should've known better than to get that at a charcoal grill.I wish Raku would move to SF... because I'm not that interested in relocating to LV.I love this restaurant!  Must return (but this is but one more reason to come to LV) !!! *6 Solid Stars*pix laters...- 1 STAR for the attitude with reservationsYesterday was a blur and needed my Raku fix on! Grateful for an awesome company, we were greeted with friendship and hospitality, thanks to Satay's own Saturday nights Patio Sessions resident DJ Nathan Sense Uhlir, who splurged us with a pitcher of Sapporo beer and a side of laughs throughout dinner.It has been a while since my last visit to Raku and I was pleased that Raku expanded their restaurant with a new room. The table that we sat in was really cool. It had an open rectangular shape in the middle of our booth/table that had a mini traditional/organic barbecue pit.Mr. Uhlir ordered most of the items on the special black board menu and everything was fantastic! I only wish that I had written down the names, but since I didn't my list of items in US version as follows:Homemade cold and hot tofu.Raw cold meat with amazing edible accessories on top & a drop of sauceSpecial Toro Dish (seared fatty tuna)Special grilled Salmon collar bonefrom the Robatta Grill:Enoki Mushroom wrapped with BaconGreen Hot Chili Pepper Kurobuta Pork CheekAnd last but not least: Soba buckwheat noodle salad with amazing secret dressing! Each time we order this salad, we drink the excess dressing like soup! I LOVE RAKU! Service and food never fails and last night, I had tears of joy in my Raku!Raku reminds me that I'm in Vegas, grossly overpriced for a lot of stuff. But if you're willing to be fork over the cash, you will no doubt get quality, just don't expect to get value out of your meal.* Foie gras OOOOO    M          M   GGGGGO         O    M M   M M  G     O         O    M    M    M  G   G    GOOOOO    M           M  GGGGGsays it all. its one of those things you just don't want to know what it is or how its obtain, but is good.* Yellowtail Carpaccio - Fresh, clean, and refreshing taste. Personally I think Ichiza's Yellowtail Tar Tar taste much better and cheaper as well.* Enoki mushroom + Bacon - Bacon tends to be salty, but somehow Raku was able to take the saltyness out of the bacon so it doesn't overpower the enoki mushroom. Nicely executed item.* Sawagani (Japanese River Crab) - This has a lot of wow factor when you first see it. The novelty quickly wears off when you eat them. Nothing really special about them in the taste department. The bigger crabs have less flavor than the smaller ones because all you get is shell on the big ones.* Uni + Seaweed Miso Soup - The uni was incredibly fresh and has a surprising sweetness to them. The seaweed miso soup didn't overpower the taste of the uni. If they served this nigri style, it would taste even more awesome. * Kobe Beef + Wasabi - Good, but not the melt in your mouth taste I come to expect with Kobe beef. The wasabi was also very light tasting.* Kobe Beef Liver - You think you're getting Kobe Beef for the first few bites, than when you're about to swallow you get the liver taste. A good item to get even to get even if you don't like liver.* Lamb Chop - Perfectly cooked medium rare. Very tasty and just juicy. How can Wynn & Texas de Brazil fail so badly cooking lamb.* Rice Balls - Miso flavored riceballs. $5 for 2. Nothing special and so not worth it.* Drunken Garlic Clams - Fresh clams with a good broth. This is reminiscence of the equally tasting stuff at Naked Fish.* Lava cake - Its a lava cake. Nothing really special from the other lava cakes I've tried before.* Cinnamon + Chocolate Pudding - This is like milk with chocolate and cinnamon remnants. The waitress said to mix well and I did. A lighter chunky version of chocolate milk?* Cheesecake - Cheesecake tends to be very heavy in cheese taste, but it was beaten so it tastes very light, but still taste the cheese. It makes you feel like you can eat this all day and not feel guilty about it. The lightness of the cheese works on this desert. The wait staff is very friendly, helpful, and attentive. Nothing more you can ask from the wait staff.But service isn't perfect. When you're eating at Raku, expect to stay 1 hour at the minimum since food comes out very slow at first. But if you do order a lot of items, they come out one right after another. Reservations is absolutely required, I've been denied numerous times till I finally went during the middle of the week. Ladies, if a guy asks you where you want to eat, Ichiza or Raku and he's paying, say Raku and bash your eyelashes and smile at him. Guys, don't even mention Raku no matter what kind of cute looks she may give you, you're wallet will thank you!Raku has good food, but you pay a steep price for the ambiance and each item that isn't really that special compared to Ichiza. Raku is a lot more consistent than Ichiza, but Ichiza has the advantage of being able to try multiple things when you be lucky to get 1 item at Raku.Been to Raku at least 25-30 times since they opened. Being a part of the industry crowd it was awesome to have a late night place with the kinda food I like. This town is crying for better food without having to go to the strip or some shitty chain restaurant. I think that restaurants have spent years taking advantage of the fact that a lotta peeps still have the buffet mentality. Most bang for the buck even if it's frozen, reheated then slathered in mayonnaise. The quality of the food, presentation, setting etc is exceptional and should be the standard for restaurant expectations. People are tripping when they say Raku is overpriced. If you are that cheap and don't understand good food then stick to all you can eat sushi or the $10 buffet. Compared to any Japanese restaurant in the country for the prices they charge the food is phenomenal stars. However the issue I have is my last 2 visits. I saw a big change in their service staff from last year, not sure what happened. The old lady BTW is A FUCKING RUDE BITCH. Yes I come from an Asian background in culinary as well and what the hell is your problem after we spend $300 - $400 every time we go there??? Last couple of times they were out of numerous menu items. Understandably they prep x amount per day, but not once did they say that items were not available until we tried to order. It was annoying to the point that I finally asked the waitress to just tell me what they did not have. She next proceeded to repeat what I had already ordered, but was not available. Thanks. This happened several times. Getting drink order and refills was a major pain in the ass. The first round of food we ordered, all cold apps took nearly 50 minutes. In addition, some items we ordered the waitress came back 30 minutes later to tell us they were sold out. Table wasn't even bussed then somewhere near the 3rd round of food they came and pulled plates that we were still working on. All in all the service during my last 2 visits was almost nonexistent. Maybe it was the fact that on one of those visits the owner had a big party of friends on one table and that was their primary focus of the night. Who knows? I've seen lots of people being comped items and that doesn't bother me. The only thing I would expect is to have someone at least come to check on our drinks, bus the table without having to wait 25 minutes and at least keep us informed when food is going to take an hour. I love the food there and I would still recommend it to anyone, but the service has plainly gone to shit.Pains me that I can't give this place 4 or even 5 stars!  The food and service really were outstanding.  BUT and this is a big BUT, my brother and I got a major case of food poisoning from eating a semi cooked oyster appetizer there, which all but ruined the last night of my bachelor party in vegas.   While I know that the extreme heat in Las Vegas makes it difficult to properly refrigerate shell fish to prevent contamination , there's no reason why a place which charges high end prices for japanese food should let this happen.  I'm sure we either got a case of rotovirus or vibrio, whatever it was, it was horrendous.  I almost collapsed at the encore craps table and then proceeded to spend the next 24 hours attached to the toilet.  If you do go, AVOID the oyster! You'll thank me for this later.Update:Despite trying to contact the owner several times, i was consistently ignored until I wrote a letter to the Nevada Public Health Service who promptly did launch an investigation. The response, well it was a short email that didn't even admit guilt for our illness.  YES there are several very positive reviews for this place, but if you get sick here DON'T expect an ounce of sympathy from the owner.  Just be prepared to crap you brains out and deal with it yourself!WOW.I made late night reservations for Raku on a Thursday night.  As a fan of nearby Ichiza and their izakaya cuisine, I had heard that Raku served similar fare but was even better.  I was skeptical, but my sister swore by the place as well, having visited Raku along with some foodie friends of hers.  If it hadn't been for her insistence, I'm not sure I would have squeezed a visit in my busy schedule.I am SO glad I did.  The taxi driver took us for a 10 minute drive off the strip into Chinatown where Raku is located.  A stereotypical strip mall store front greets you but inside the decor is modern and clean despite the small interior space.  Patrons were at every table and it's clear late night dining is their strength as they open til 2 am.    After a brief wait, our seats opened and we began to peruse the extensive menu.  Grilled yakitori items, oden broths, appetizers, and plentiful drinking choices greeted us.  Our plan of attack was simple: try a few things, get a few drinks, and continue as warranted.Hours later, I had come to a clear conclusion : Raku is quite simply the best Japanese restaurant I have ever been to and one of the best restaurants PERIOD that I have ever enjoyed.  As a huge fan of this type of Japanese cuisine, the preparation and presentation of all the dishes blew me away and it's been a long time since I've enjoyed a meal quite as much as I enjoyed this one.  Kudos to my sis.  A few standouts from among the 13 dishes I had:House-made Cold and Hot agedashi tofu - supremely fresh and soft with a hint of sweetness, I enjoyed both presentations.  The cold version is served with their signature green tea sea salt and their raku house soy sauce.  Both taste completely unlike any condiment you've had and enhance the cold tofu wonderfully.  The hot tofu is served in a rich oden broth and served with salmon roe.  Need I say more?Beef Tendon Oden Broth and Meat Intestine Oden Broth - $1.50 each.  Are you kidding me???  $1.50?!?!  That's it???  The single serving of tendon and intestine was flavorful, tender, and complemented wonderfully by the fantastic oden broth they make in house here.  I could order bowls of this stuff and stay all day.Shima Aji Sashimi - fantastic cuts, served in three ways - on top of fresh seaweed, on top of soft glass noodles, and on top of a sauce.  Fresh as can be....how do they get that in the dessert?Nagareko - braised abalone in broth.  One of the most tender abalones I've tasted and not the least bit overdone.  A strong delicious broth of seaweed accompanied it and enhanced the abalone flavor and aroma.  Top notch special.Grilled enoki mushroom with bacon, asparagus with bacon, and Grilled chicken yakitori - I've had yakitori at many places, most notable Sumika in Los Altos, but this was the best I've ever had.  Fantastic flavors, super tender, and absolutely crispy high quality bacon.  It simply is another level beyond yakitori I've had before.  Can't beat the $2-3 yakitori prices either (besides Kobe beef)Seafood with bonito guts - a favorite at Kappo Nami Nami in Mountain View, bonito guts are salted bonito intestines that go wonderfully with sake.   Their version is mixed with high quality sashimi and uni.  Besides the food highlights, the drink menu is outstanding and goes wonderfully with the food.  Fusion cocktails, Japanese specialty beers, and an extensive sake litter  the menu.  But it was the wonderful hot house sake that I loved for both it's sweetness and it's modest $7 price per bottle.  If there are any misses at Raku, they are the oyakodon (the one dish that disappointed....egg slightly overdone) and the desserts (interesting but not mindblowing).  Otherwise, Raku is one of the best Japanese restaurants I've had and I immediately wanted to return the next day.  They have long been a top Yelp restaurant and even been named Restaurant of the Year.  The hype matched the reality.  For you NorCal Japanese fans, think of the best of Gochi, Sumika, Kappo Nami Nami combined and at even better prices and better quality.  I'm not sure you'll find food this good except in Japan.  It's simply that great.  Reservations are a must and late night dining is encouraged to avoid crowds.  Raku accepts credit cards, including American Express.Immaculate flavors...instructions included.After weeks of anticipation, my dinner at Raku finally arrived last night.  The fact that this place exists where it does is curiously incredible; somewhere very special nestled in an extremely unspecial looking shopping center.  A few minutes after sitting down our server walked over with a chalkboard full of specials.  The specials started at raw foods and culminated in the cooked meats.I asked the server if we could order the omakase menu.  She told me that normally the chef likes a few days notice for that, but she would ask him.  Well lucky for us, the chef said yes, and for $50 each, we began our journey through some of the most exciting tastes and textures I've had since moving to Las Vegas.I came prepared, ready to snap photos of everything we ate and write down the main components of each dish.  As soon as the first plate came, I scrapped that plan, and decided to just fully immerse myself in the wonderful experience.  We were served many things, and I cannot do them all the justice they deserve in this review, so I will focus on my three favorite items:Fresh Water Mackeral Sashimi - Completely raw, not cured in salt of Kombu.  The mackeral was regally delicate, with a shimmering silver skin.  The dim lights in the restaurant illuminated the fish like a spotlight from the sky.  Crispy Mackeral - The skin and bones from the mackarel we ate sashimi from were served.  LIght and crispy, I could have snacked on this on the couch while watching Jeopardy!  I loved being able to enjoy the whole fish, and appreciate the chef's attention to both the complexity of flavors, and sustainable food practice.  Braised Abalone - served with daikon radish and an elegant sea weed broth.  Each bite was an explosion of new flavors, I felt like I new taste buds were sprouting up on my tongue especially for this dish.  Not to offend, but it was like losing your virginity, only less awkward afterwards.  Raku is one of those must-haves for the appreciative eater.  Each dish will be brought out along with recommendations of how to fully enjoy all the flavors.  This is magnificent meal, reservations are a must.  Can't take a trip to Japan, allow your tongue to experience what the rest of you cannot.I'm stoked that my 100th review will be for such a great restaurant!I have been wanting to try Raku ever since I heard about it. The first couple times we tried to go, we called that day and they were booked until way past my bedtime. So we decided to plan ahead and made reservations a couple of weeks in advance. I wanted to make sure and try the best items so when we made our reservations, I requested the $75 omakase dinner. For our first course we had the sashimi salad. This was one of my favorites of the night. It came with 2 dressings, one spicy and one sweet. The fish was high quality. The crisp onions on top provided a nice flavor and textural contrast. It was a lovely way to start our meal.Next we were served Raku's tofu. They make their own tofu and it comes with bonito, green onion, and ginger. The waitress suggested using the green tea salt and soy sauce to season it as well. The soy sauce is homemade and has a slightly sweet flavor. The tofu had a creamy, smooth texture. I never imagined imagined eating plain tofu and liking it, but I did.For our third course we had Agedashi tofu which was deep fried tofu in a miso broth topped with salmon roe. It was exceptional. This was another of my favorites of the night. I don't know how they make tofu so delicious!Next up was grilled tomatoes. They had a nice charcoal grill flavor.Course 5 was juicy deep fried chicken. It was served on a bed of spinach and had awesome crispy skin with sesame. It was indeed juicy and very tasty.We then had asparagus with bacon. It consisted of 3 small spears of asparagus wrapped in bacon. The bacon had a nice smoky grilled flavor.Our seventh course was butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce. The scallop was nicely cooked and the sweet soy sauce complemented the dish nicely. This was in my wife's top three dishes.Our next dish was yellowtail with glazed soy-based sauce. It was served with minced radish. The radish made the dish go from good to great. It was a perfect pairing.Next up was chicken wrapped with skin. It was salty and was a great contrast to the previous slightly sweet courses. The skin was sinfully good.We then were served Kurobuta pork cheek. It was chewy and reminded me of steak fat. That might not sound appetizing, but it was really good.For our 11th course we had Kobe beef outside skirt with garlic. My wife loved how the garlic chips complemented by the beef. I liked it too, but by this time I was getting full.Next was another of my favorites, steamed foie gras egg custard. The custard was beautifully cooked. It was served in a delicious broth. Though I was getting full by now, I couldn't stop eating it.After that we were served Tsukune grilled ground chicken. It looked like a chicken sausage. I was stuffed so I only ate a bite and took the rest home.We then were given grilled rice balls. One was flavored with soy sauce and the other with miso. I only had a bite and packed the rest.Lastly, we were given two desserts. First up was green tea creme brûlée. The green tea ice cream was subtly flavored and just slightly sweet. It was a nice balance to creme brûlée.Our other dessert was cheesecake. It had raspberries hidden inside. I love raspberries, and when I ate the raspberry sitting on top of the cheesecake I exclaimed, "That's a nice raspberry!"  The cheesecake was fluffy and airy. It was served with a delicious raspberry sauce and green tea salt.Playing in the background was Japanese elevator music, including a rendition of Michael Jackson's "Beat It" which was pretty neat.The bathroom has artificial grass on the floor, a fake tree growing up the wall, foliage on the ceiling, birds playing in the background, and flower petals on the floor. A must see!The meal was definitely delicious, but I think we should have gone with a $50 omakase meal as there were about five too many courses. I well definitely go back! Can't wait to try my favorites again and sample some new dishes!Time for an update!  Since my last review I've been to the sake tasting and had the Kaiseki menu. First, the sake tasting.  This happened back in February.  $45 for AYCE Raku food PLUS all the sake and Sapporo you can drink!  All the tables are reorganized for a cocktail-type service.  The food is freshly cooked and is served at the bar buffet style in the front of the restaurant.  Small servings of tofu, various skewers of meat from the Robata grill, asparagus wrapped in bacon, all the good stuff.  The staff just keeps cooking and bringing food out.  It was from 10pm to 2am, which is not the best time for me, but it was worth it!  Not too crowded.  We made a reservation but they accepted walk-ins too.  People come and go as they please so that helps.  The sake servers are really knowledgeable.  I learned a lot.  I really, really hope they do this again but I have not seen another announcement for this since the last one in February.  Such a good deal and so much fun, too!Second, I had the 15-course Kaiseki menu earlier this month.  This is not for the faint of heart or those who are in a hurry.  It's $150 per person and they need at least 3 days notice.  You need to make a reservation and they take your credit card number because they actually start preparing your meal 3 days in advance!  The website says it takes about 3 hours to complete.  Ours took around 3.5 hours.  It was an awesome experience!  The menu changes each time but here are some of the highlights: homemade tofu served with roe, sashimi, foie gras custard, a sampling of their appetizers including deep fried chicken and crispy asparagus, steak and garlic cooked on a really hot stone, and fluffy cheesecake.  I've downloaded pics if you are interested.  Definitely come hungry.  I didn't eat all day.  There is also a $100 10-course menu.This is my favorite restaurant in all of Las Vegas.  Once I get off my stupid diet, I'm going here.Never did I think that the words "tofu" and "mouthwatering" would ever be used in the same sentence. Although I've had different versions of Japanese food before, Raku takes the prize hands down. Hidden in a strip mall way away from all the casinos and bright lights, Raku prefers to keep it understated. The restaurant only has about 10-12 tables along with a small room for groups near the back. I'd suggest calling ahead for a reservation, but since they stay open so late (someone tells me 3 a.m.?), chances are you'll be seated eventually. If you've never had traditional Japanese food before, the menu is pretty overwhelming. I was lucky enough to dine here with a local and he did all of the ordering. Good thing, too, because I had no idea where to start. We definitely had the tofu (get it! so good!) and a myriad of small plates, including scallops and salmon- two fish that I normally turn my nose up at, but were SO good! These chefs know their sauces. That's all I have to say about that...Go here with someone (or a few someones) that you really like, order yourselves a ton of food and plan on "oohing" and "aahing" the entire time.If you haven't spoken to someone who has dined here, you won't know about this place. Its tiny and located in a very run-down unassuming strip mall on Spring Mountain. You would never guess that such delicious and fine Japanese cuisine comes out of this place!I've eaten here a few times and I will continue to return. The style of their dishes is similar to izakaya. Lots of small dishes and be sure to order some sake cocktails. The waitress will bring over a specials board which is changed quite frequently. I will tell you that the most delicious items I've eaten have been off this menu. But BEWARE: this board will draw you in but most if not all items are upwards of $20 close to $30.You can't order a bad thing on the menu. However, there is so much variety. If you're not familiar with Japanese dining, you might be a bit intimidated. The waitresses are very sweet. At times it might be difficult to communicate through their Japanese accents but they're always delighted to answer any questions.Happy Eating! And be sure to make a reservation or you'll never get to try this place. It gets packed quick.Finally had the opportunity to bust my Raku cherry with three friends visiting from out of town, and when you have a group of folks walk in with no appetite from a heavy late lunch and still managed to complete a meal with their taste buds completely blown away, it is clearly a sign of just pure amazing food.  We had a taste of a few items from each section (appetizers, robata grill, and noodles/rice/soups), and can hardly wait to return for more.  I was so inspired that I composed a Raku Haiku for each of our selections:"Sashimi Salad"Fresh slice of the seaDeep-fried onions paired with greensPerfect start to meal"Agedashi Tofu"House made soybean dreamAmazing broth, chili, roeTen dollars well spent"Apple Marinated Lamb Chop"Succulent two chopsAromatically juicyNo shame to gnaw bone"Soboro Don- Seasoned Ground Chicken"Quail yolk atop riceMix ingredients and shareComfort food at its best"Grilled rice ball"Two nuggets of artFragrant mint countervailed with crunchComplements all meats"Asparagus"Crispy rice coatingPerfect balance in textureVeggie laced with crack"Kobe beef skirt steak"Ribeye pales to youWhere have you been all my life?Melt in your mouth joy"Pork Cheek"Bacon's lost cousinI feel guilty eating this...Yet I cannot stopThe chefs of today may well be the Van Goghs of our time. The care and precision of modern food presentation has made some of the creations on our plates incredible edible works of art.The Japanese have the art of food presentation imbued in their food culture and they really put their heart and soul into making their food a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.On my visit to Las Vegas last September, I was starting to feel a bit jaded about eating at the big corporate named restaurants on the strip and sought out a dinner spot more in keeping with being a locals' favourite. A Yelp search threw up Raku and a quick check with local Yelp friend Emily R confirmed that it was one of her favourite spots in town.I was especially drawn to their kaiseki menu, where they create a unique menu based on the best ingredients available that day. A quick phone call secured  my dinner reservation and as requested on their website, I pre-ordered the kaiseki menu.My taxi dropped outside Raku, which is located in a non-descipt small off-Strip mall. Any initial fears about the unprepossessing surroundings were soon dispelled by the warm welcome I received on entering the restaurant. There was a general hubbub of conviviality in the restaurant all evening with many customers obviously being happy regulars.I bagged a seat at my favourite place to sit in a restaurant - at the counter watching the chefs at work. I was able to chat to the main chef all evening, who was very happy to engage and explain things to me about my unfolding gastronomic adventure.Every dish was a work of art and there were quite a few new flavours for my palate to savour.1. Mountain potato croquettes in dashi broth2. Eight mini treasures, including creations such as tofu skin with wasabi and egg with sashimi3. The house signature homemade silken tofu with salmon roe and homemade green tea salt and soya sauce4. Fluke sashimi and liver with spring radish and grated onion dipped in ponzu sauce5. Japanese/Spanish mackarel marinated in yuzu6. Foie gras/egg custard/summer truffle served in an egg shell7. Eel with shisho pepper8. Uni with egg9. Kobe beef on hot rock flamed with Hennessy XO sauce10. Mixed tuna over rice11. Panna cotaAs you can see, the list of ingredients is like a who's who of the best ingredients to pass one's lips. Everything was a delight to eat. I love the way that Japanese cookery has given exquisite food presentation to the west but in return, the has given them ingredients like foie gras to cook with.Service was always with a smile all evening.The final touch of class came at the end of my meal when the chef confessed that normally, they don't do the kaiseki menu for only one person due to the large amount of prep time involved but as I was visiting from London, they made an exception.Arigato, Aburiya Raku!I ate at Raku by a friend's recommendation (thanks Julie K and Bobby L. for driving).  Whenever I go to Vegas, I rarely have the opportunity to head to Chinatown \ Spring Valley so this was a nice surprise.  Back at home in the Bay Area, I've eaten at a fair amount of Izakaya joints but I must say that Raku really blew me away!Unfortunately I can't remember a few dishes that I took pics of because were had ordered them from their Specials Board.  Just let the pics explain themselves.Here are the highlights:Raku's Tofu(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=vKeXGJldbsQM01iXXVwoSA)Right off the bat, their Tofu blew me away.  And we're talking about plain no-frills house-made tofu.  We thought it was so good that we ordered another plate of it!  Blue Fin Tuna(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=CkPFeK_AAvYzPAb3DKuAuQ#CkPFeK_AAvYzPAb3DKuAuQ)Very fresh!Enoki Mushrooms(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=GkrGZds3BHOoC-5mvKKIVg)This was a good appetizer before the meat dishes started to arriveSalmon Belly (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=IHbcDOAdYFyN0CYIkkpSpw#IHbcDOAdYFyN0CYIkkpSpw)Very tasty!!Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=gpHaJuO8n-WQ_1LfnYSidw#gpHaJuO8n-WQ_1LfnYSidw)This one was okay but didn't really do much for me.Kurobuta Pork Cheek(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=tzjYja7zbBreFMGNT-Be9w)Same thing goes for the pork cheek.  This was actually quite tough and required a lot of chewing.Burger Special (Forgot the name)(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=IHbcDOAdYFyN0CYIkkpSpw#IHbcDOAdYFyN0CYIkkpSpw)If you know me, then you know I love Japanese Hamburger Steaks.  I just love it when you cut them open and a whole pocket of steam just erupts from it.  I really like this dish.  It was a pretty good meat combo with beef and pork and the sauce when well with it.Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=GKzNDSHfkTVf1_7JujeJ2w#GKzNDSHfkTVf1_7JujeJ2w)If there's one thing that can top the burger, it's these Kobe Beef sticks.  Very flavorful and cooked very good!Foie Gras with Glazed Soy-base Sauce(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=P7GZFWsN7vuNJin6ZiVzqQ)And if there's one thing that can top the Kobe Beef and basically everything in the menu, it's this Foie Gras stick.  The Soy-base Sauce just made it heavenly!I would definitely come back again here for another visit.  The food was excellent and the service was spot on.  And for all that we ordered, the split bill still came down to $37 a person with tax and tip.  Can't really ask for anything more.  After eating their food, it was quite obvious whey Raku is such a hot spot for foodies and local and celebrity chefs.Seriously good  Japanese comfort food (robata grill) combined with outstanding artistry.For starters, agedashi tofu.  Sublime; fried house made tofu bathed in a heavenly flavored dashi base topped with briny salmon roe.From the robata grill, Kurobuta pork cheeks (face, not butt, sweet porky goodness),  enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon (smoky richness), "Kobe" fillet with wasabi (tender, wasabi brings out a mineral earthiness and sweetness), "Kobe" skirt with garlic (razor thin slivers of garlic mixes with melting beef fat), and if they have it, teriyaki foie (orgasmic flavor explosion that goes on and on).Finally, the kaiseki meals are incredible.  They feature small portions of the best of the robata grill mixed with delicacies not offered anywhere else on the menu.  Some of the dishes are out there.  One night offered sea snails another foie chawanmushi.  Both surprisingly delicious.  Keep an open mind.  The progression of courses in flavors, textures, and temperature is well thought out.  Well worth the $100 or $150.  Note:  three day advance reservations required for the kaiseki and all members of your group need to order it.Tip:  always ask if there are any off the menu specials.  Depending on how much they "like" you, you may be in for a real treat (sorry, it's an Asian thing).Good selection of sake at all quality and price levels. Needless to say, highly recommended.There are certain times in life when food takes center stage.Ladies, and Gents...Raku is beyond that.I popped in on a whim the other night. Countless coworkers would tell me about how this was the BEST restaurant in all of Las Vegas. I took it for granted, because people always say that about one restaurant or another. I guess I had to experience it for myself.A friend and I stopped in without a reservation last week. It's a small restaurant and each of the tables (but one) was occupied. The dining room is small. It may remind you of the dining scene in San Francisco or New York City. The kind of place that begs for your attention through it's subtle exterior.After a short wait, we were seated at a nice table.We ordered:-Agadashi Tofu -- So perfect and so good!-House Tofu -- Also amazing. Next time I'd probably get half and half with Agadashi.-Black Cod -- Better than Nobu. This was off the seasonal Fish menu.-Crispy Asparagus -- Perfectly cooked, crunchy, crispy delicious.-Fried Shrimp -- Delicious. These are full shrimp. Don't get grossed out by the shrimp heads.-Green Tea Creme Brulee -- The perfect ending to a fantastic meal.Your table will have some seasonings on it. A green tea salt. A chili powder. A sake chili thing. And soy sauce which is incredible and seasoned with plum. Use these seasonings. Mix and match. They tend to provide a different experience with each mixture.This one meal is a Top Five for me. I'm no stranger to food, and good food at that. This is the spot that is a MUST TRY when you are in Vegas.Total Bill for Two -- About 60 bucks.Return Timetable: Immediate.This is Part II of my Japanese Double Dinner in Vegas.Second stop: RakuSo after my first dinner at Trattoria Nakamura-Ya in Part I (http://bit.ly/WueK9g), I had my second dinner with my friends at Raku just a few doors down!This was my second visit to Raku and I must say it was even better than the first!! Being from California, we came here with one mission.  Order hella foie gras!!!Well we came and we conquered!!Raku Tofuhttp://bit.ly/WcmXzaThis is a must order every time you come here!  It's so creamy.  You can tell they take a lot of pride in their tofu making craftEnoki Mushroomshttp://bit.ly/WpawPX (Pic from my last visit)When I go to any izakaya house, this is always a default order for me.  Especially since it's wrapped in bacon!!  Raku's is nicely done!!Yellowtail Carpacciohttp://bit.ly/VkP0ugVery fresh and tasty Yellowtail!Negitoro Specialhttp://bit.ly/WLd2OxFatty Tuna Belly at it's finest! Foie Gras Custardhttp://bit.ly/118rMwADon't know what to say about this one.  Very cold, but who cares, it's freaking Foie Gras!!!Kobe Beef with Garlic Skewershttp://bit.ly/WpaIyB (Pic from my last visit)Mmm.....Kobe Beef!!!  This was the a great lead in to the finale.....Foie Gras Skewers for the Table!!!http://bit.ly/VkkoqZOH MAN!!!  Food porn galore!  Here's a close up of this indulgence skewered on two sticks(http://bit.ly/WudzGP).  Oh yeah!  I loved how they saved the best for last!Green Tea Creme Bruleehttp://bit.ly/VOpiOYOkay so it wasn't entirely the last dish.  We did have dessert and while it wasn't Foie Gras, it was a very refreshing Green Tea Creme Brulee with Green Tea Ice Cream.What can I say?  Raku is amazing!  Even in the bay area, I don't think there's another izakaya restaurant that can compare to it.  I'll definitely be back again soon!Overall: 4.5 starsFood presentation is awesome here.Sashimi salad- very fresh & light 10 ptsPoached egg w sea urchin - very interesting texture kinda slimy but sea tasting.  Uni doesnt overwhelm the rest of the items in the dish. 9 ptsButter scallop - so yummy & delicate. 10 ptsBaby seabass- not as soft as I expected it 2b. Too many bones, was so disappointed in this dish.  Not worth $25 price tag  2 ptsFried agadashi tofu very yummy tender & tasty 9.9 ptsGreen tea creme brulee - perfect combo of flavors. green tea ice cream just seals the deal here. Great way to finish off dinner. 11 ptsThey charge for tea here... =(Service can be a bit slow here.It's taken me a LONG time to getting around to this review, but I needed to dedicate time to properly raving about this wonderful meal. I visited on 04/11/2013 with my fiance Ruben and our cousin Daisy (visiting from the Bay Area). We were sat in a private dining area and it was so cool and intimate. I was really glad I made that reservation a couple months in advance!We tried the Raku's Tofu: Housemade tofu that was super silky served with fresh grated ginger, green onions, and Katsuoboshi. Then topped with some of Raku's Soy Sauce (Japanese Daijingo soy sauce blended with Japanese plum). Simple and tasty. Also, the Agedashi Tofu: Their housemade tofu lightly fried and presented in a bowl of warm dashi broth and topped with green onions, Ikura, and nori. And for an extra kick, some hot chili paste placed on the rim of your bowl. Really, really great. I'm a big fan of tofu so I could be happy eating Raku's Tofu all night, but this Agedashi Tofu is a party of flavors in your mouth.We also tried the Tempura Asparagus, Kanpachi sashimi (special), Blue Fin Tuna sashimi (special), Salmon with Ikura Oroshi, Enoki Mushroom Wrapped in Bacon, Direct-Flamed Eggplant (served with Katsuoboshi), Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce, Kobe Beef Filet with Wasabi, Apple Marinated Lamb Chop, Grilled Rice Balls, Yellowtail with Glazed Soy-based Sauce, and Juicy Deep Fried Chicken. Their Yuzu Sake is really delicious.My favorites were the tofu dishes, the sashimi specials, Enoki Mushroom with Bacon (this was SO good, we ordered it twice), and Apple Marinated Lamp Chop (we ordered two of these as well).Our meal was spectacular. We had so much fun with all the dishes and the service was wonderful. There are so many selections and everything was, at the least exciting, and at the best, amazing. I would compare the experience to enjoying tapas with great friends. Same idea with sharing small plates and that's just always a blast in my book. The food was wonderful, I seriously can't wait to go back and try some of their other amazing concoctions!In a city where I've had subpar Asian eats, my experiences at Raku has been on another level. When it was first recommended to me, I expected it to be part of the Strip like any other high end eatery, and one that was in the confines of a casino resort. Instead, it is a Japanese establishment in the splendors of Chinatown.My expectations were surprisingly low the first time around. I haven't had incredible experiences of the Japanese kind in Vegas just yet, plus I was less likely to put faith in a place that was more Asian fusion than pure Japanese as Raku seems to be. And in the seediness of Chinatown no less? I was already beginning to doubt its $$$$ rating.But thankfully, my expectations were not only met but exceeded in every way. Everything was truly spectacular, from the small plates to the entrees and it was hard to pass up anything considering how fresh and tasty it all was. Stars of the initial evening were bold cuts of sashimi, namely blue fin tuna, coupled by an incredible array of tofu dishes and one dish that would make any seafood lover salivate: fresh uni with salmon roe, topped off by a perfectly poached egg.It has been several visits since then and all is right with the world. Client dinners have been nothing short of amazing and my personal escapades have resulted in a lot of experimentation with the menu. I've become enamored with a live uni udon, their daily blue crab miso soup, and their array of skewered meats. Kobe beef, chicken skin, and pork cheek have been favorites in all izakaya circles.The service, ambiance, and overall visits have been excellent to the T. Las Vegas is lucky to be home to so many wonderful establishments, but Raku is certainly one of their shiniest gems in the desert. 5 Stars and nothing less.Raku is one of my favorite restaurants for a number of reasons.  Great things happen when I eat here and the food is excellent. To celebrate a special occasion, I went here. We were considering getting the omakase for $100/person but that's like a lottery - you don't know what items you'll get. Although I've never had anything I didn't like from this place, we had specific things we wanted to try. My faves:Kobe Beef Filet with Wasabi, Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic, Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce, Foie Gras with Glazed Soy-base Sauce, Asparagus with Bacon, Enoki Mushroom Wrapped with Bacon and Green Tea Creme Brulee. I love their blue fin sashimi but we didn't order that this time.Aside from my faves, we also tried Raku's homemade tofu, juicy deep-fried chicken, steamed foie gras egg custard, chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin, kobe beef silver skin, Iberico pork and kanpachi kama.Homemade Tofu:Can be ordered in half or full portions. Comes with ginger, green onions and bonito. The texture of the tofu is so different from all the tofu I've ever had. It has the consistency of formed cottage cheese. 4.5/5Juicy Deep-Fried Chicken:Crispy skin, juicy fatty chicken. Absolutely delicious! 5/5Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard:This dish has the same broth as in agedashi tofu. This chawanmushi has a mild foie gras taste to it and has a piece of duck on top. 5/5Chicken Breast Wrapped with Chicken Skin:Slightly crisp chicken skin seasoned with salt. For some reason, I really liked the simplicity of this dish. 5/5Kobe Beef Silver Skin:A bit oily and sweet. This is the skin of a cow put on a skewer and grilled. 4/5Iberico Pork:I love jamon Iberico and I was thinking this would be similar. But this is actual chunks of pork with a yummy sauce and grilled. 5/5Kanpachi Kama:Perfectly grilled amberjack collar with a nice ponzu/soy dipping sauce. Although I was not in the mood for fish, I still think this is the best kama in town. Very meaty, moist (terrible word) and perfectly cooked. 5/5Although the last time we went here, they didn't have 2 items we wanted: Poached Egg w/ Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe and, Hamachi Kama. They also changed their decor. They replaced Hello Kitty with a pig with a big mouth - creepy looking mofo! I'd still come back here regardless...Small tiny place that you have to make reservations for WAY in advance. My mom made a reservation for us 2 weeks in advance, and if you're late..within 15 minutes they will give your table to somebody else. Located in a small tiny corner in Chinatown. We got there about 10 minutes before our reservation time, but we were assisted to sit down right away. The food itself takes quite a long time to arrive. We were there for almost 2 hours. It took about a good 45 minutes for the first plate to come out. I actually prefer Shin Sen Gumi Yakitori over this place. The taste isn't as strong as theirs. But, overall it's pretty good. Popeye salad $8- Spinach and bacon (mainly), decently good. A little too salty, but a good salad nonetheless!Asparagus Okaki $5- DELICIOUS. Super crunchy, and it actually tasty cheesy! Nom nom. Juicy Fried Chicken $9- Not a favorite. Didn't have too much flavor to it, and it was strangely chewy. Slightly warm as well. Ice Fish $8.50- Frowning as I write this. I don't like fish, and I don't like seeing multiple tiny fishes fried up whole. I ate like 3.. D: no gusta.Agedashi Tofu $11- Pretty good! I just didn't like the fish eggs inside, but overall it was a good and flavored dish!Momo chicken thigh $2.75 each- Err, it was a little too pink for my liking, and it was kind of fatty. It was okay Tsukune $3.50 each- Shin Sen's is much tastier. This one comes as like a drumstick, and I had to keep adding more togarashi. Not enough sauce. Harami Kobe Beef skirt $7.50 each- Delicious! Comes with grunchy garlic chips. Mmm, super tasty!Yakionigiri $5.00 (comes with 2)- It was..okay. LolScallop with soy sauce $7.00- Not sure how this tasted. Didn't eat this one!Asparagus with Bacon $3.00- Comes with 3 pieces, pretty good. Asahi $7.00Umeshu $12.00 (super delicious!)Overall, the flavor was almost there, and I didn't think it was the greatest.Since my initial visit during their first year opened, I've been back a handful of times and felt it was time I updated my review.  Raku is the kind of place we usually reserve for special occasions and recommend to out of town guests.  Our most recent visit was only last week as the Husband and I celebrated our five year wedding anniversary.We attempted to make reservations on the same day and the only opening they had was at 9:00 pm.  We did a walk in to hopefully land a cancellation spot or two of the coveted five counter seats, and it was only a 30 minute wait for the counter seats!  Sweet!  But yes, make reservations way in advance, especially if you have a larger party or it's a weekend.The thing to look out for is the Specials Board.  They usually list about 5-6 items on there that range from raw to cooked items.  The weirdest part about this board is that it will change during your visit there.  During our 2-3 hour dinner, we saw some things sell out and get replaced with something else.  The waitstaff doesn't mention the newer items, so it's something you just have to look out for.  (For example, oysters were not listed on the specials board but the party sitting next to us ended up ordering the last giant oyster.  They were seated after us and only knew about it because the oyster was sitting on ice right in front of them!  They had squid on ice too, but it wasn't listed on the specials board!)  So, not only are you keeping your eyes out for the changing Specials Board but you have to see what's fresh and on ice that day!  We do get a few cooked items and although they are good, the raw fish choices are always the best!These days we skip the Robata Grill items, not because they aren't tasty but we like to focus on the more unique items.  One of our most favorite items is the Crispy Asparagus Okaki ($5).  It's a simple asparagus that's been dredged in rice crackers and deep-fried.  I don't know why it's so good but it just is.  And when you add a little of their matcha salt, oh my gawd!  I just love it.Another item we had on this last visit include the Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard ($10).  There's a piece of duck that lays on top of this dish, and it's actually duck liver they use, not goose.  The foie gras is already mixed in with the egg, so it gives the whole dish a rich egg taste.  Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe ($9) is another unusual pairing, mostly because of the mountain yam that gives this dish a slimy texture.  You break up the egg and mix it all together, but you can't help but notice the slimy effect from the mountain yam.  It's a tasty nonetheless.  The Kobe Beef Liver Sashimi ($9.50) is something that not everyone would enjoy.  The Husband isn't usually a fan of liver, except served foie gras style, but he was game.  And it did still lend a livery taste, but it's something that you have to try once.I always enjoy homemade tofu and Raku's Tofu (Whole $5.50) does not disappoint.  They server theirs with bonito shavings, ginger, and scallions.The four condiments placed on every table should not go ignored, especially the green tea salt and their own soy sauce.  Yum!Since they expanded, their bathrooms are indeed something to look at.  First off, it's so clean and pristine and holds one of the cleanest fish tanks you'll ever see on Spring Mountain! Service on our last few visits have been much better compared to my first visit.  The waitress that took care of us at the counter never let my water glass go empty and she was always letting us know when our food was coming so we weren't waiting too long and giving us clean plates too.My only real gripe was this: Although I usually love sitting at the counter so I can watch the chefs at work, I also can't overlook things that probably shouldn't be seen by dining guests.  One of the prep guys at the counter sneezed into his hands and continued prepping the food.  I was totally turned off by this, especially because there was a sink right behind him.  It wasn't too long after when the Husband said to me that we weren't going to be ordering anymore cold foods.  When I inquired as to why, he said he noticed the same prep guy just cough into his hands and continue working.  Yes, a sneeze and cough into the very bare hands that were prepping the food.  Yuck.Nonetheless, we still do love Raku and would continue recommending it.  But alas, those basic hygiene issues need to be addressed!  4.5 stars.My third visit to Raku was a completely different experience than my last two visits in that this was my first time coming here solo.  Because of this, I wasn't able to order as much food since I had no one to share around.  However, from what I ordered during this trip, it was plenty enough to still impress and satisfy me.Agedashi Tofu -- http://bit.ly/1faVKnuThe first two times I visited I had tried their housemade Raku Tofu and had been amazed by it both times.  So this time I ordered it Agedashi style because for one thing, it looks awesome in the photos, and the other is that everything is elevated to awesomer status when it's deep fried.Foie Gras Egg Custard -- http://bit.ly/1h53VDeYou didn't think I was gonna leave Raku, or all of Vegas, without getting my Foie Gras fix since it's banned in my home state of CA.  I had this dish last time I went to Raku, but the big difference with this visit is that I got to have this all to myself......bwahahahah!Wagyu Sukiyaki -- http://bit.ly/IIHIyXThis was on the No.1 item on the top of their Specials board.  That meant that they wanted you to order it!  Like most of the items on the board there is no price listed so you know you're gonna fork up the dollars.  I've never had Grade A5 Wagyu before so this was my splurge of my entire trip.The Sukiyaki is cooked right in front of you on top of a bed of their special smoke free charcoal (http://bit.ly/IIHCaz).  Took about 5 mins to cook.There's a lot going on with this pot, first you have the A5 Wagyu on top, and underneath all that goodness, you have the housemade Raku Tofu with clear noodles and veggies.  The trippy part for me was that they give you a raw egg in a small bowl with which you must crack and beat to use for dipping sauce for the beef.  This may be sensitive to some folks, but I had good faith in their product so I went with it and it actually went well with the Wagyu Beef.  The only minor caveat I had with this dish was that the sukiyaki broth was a little too much on the sweet side.  But that is a really minor complaint because I totally enjoyed this dish.  At $45, for probably the most expensive Sukiyaki I've ever had, it was worth every penny!!Raku has done it again to impress me with their top notch service and incredible food.  It has shown me that whether you come in with a group or dine in solo, you'll have an awesome experience no matter what!!  I'll be back again soon!!!As someone who was born and raised in Japan, I can safely assure you that Raku is absolutely the most authentic, the best Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas.Before moving to Vegas, I had lived for 8 years in San Francisco Bay Area, and there were great Japanese restaurants, but few match Raku.Although on the high end, the prices aren't crazy expensive either, I'd say it's reasonable for the quality.I'm very surprised that most of Japanese restaurants on the Strip are mere gewgaws, full of upscale looking gimmicks, but I won't complain because we have Raku!Located way off the strip in an unassuming shopping center, you'd probably miss this restaurant if you blinked. Luckily, the stellar reviews made in part by my fellow Yelpers piqued my interest in finding this elusive favorite. Now locating the place is a challenge in itself but landing a reservation is equally exhausting!As fate would have it, I landed a 9pm dining reservation. Woot! Little did I know, however, that a reservation merely meant when you arrived, you'd be relegated to waiting an additional 10-15minutes for your seat. That being said, I took the opportunity to park it at the sidebar to glance over the extensive menu while guzzling down a bottle of Asahi with shots of chilled nigori. Honestly, by the time I was seated, I was about three sheets to the wind! I know, I'm a cheap date.Now onto the food shall we?I went with the server's recommendations as well as my seasoned Yelp buddies' choices who've had successful dining experiences here previously...Negitoro Blue Fin 35$ fresh and buttery slices of blue fin tuna with a cast of delectable condiments that left my taste buds doing a happy dance! Trust me, the experience is virtually umami x 10! Wagyu Sashimi 20$ - thinly sliced filets of premium rare wagyu beef with a hint of wasabi on top and accompanied with a special savory soy dipping sauce. The first bite was like velvet on my tongue and the mouthfeel was literally like butter melting in my mouth. Superb!Agedashi tofu 7.50$ 1/2 order -a delightful dish with compelling flavors and an irresistibly soft texture that had me pining for more Butter sautéed scallop 7$ x2 - my favorite dish of the evening. The butter poached scallops were soft and supple with an incredibly mouthwatering garlicky flavor and fluffy texture. Absolutely amazing!Enoki Mushroom & Bacon 3$ x2 come on now, we know everything tastes better with bacon and this was no exception. Just order it and thank me later.Chicken wrapped chicken skin 3x2 -tender chunks of chicken breast wrapped in succulent chicken skin. An indulgent  experience that is second to none Poached Egg with Sea Urchin & Salmon Roe full cast of delectable ingredients that left my taste buds in a tailspin of delight. Intriguing enjoyable and texturally fascinating! Other notable dishes included:Kobe Garlic Skirt 7.50 x2Kurobuta Pork Cheek 4.25$ x2Foie gras egg custard 10Duck in balsamic 4.50$ x2Iberico Pork 10 x2Nigori 40$ well worth it! IMO I bought 2 bottles :)All in all, I had a great dining experience at Raku and it's safe to say I'd gladly return to enjoy their enticing small plates again and, of course, to imbibe in their spirits!Happy Eats!Dear Raku,Thank you for providing great food and giving my friend a great smile. Having known my friend for more than two years, I have never seen her so happy before. This speaks a lot to your well-executed, high-quality food. My friend was amazed by the grilled salmon belly. According to her, the salmon skin was as crispy as a piece of bacon. The belly meat was fresh and smooth. She rated the salmon belly 9 out of 10, the highest rating that she had given to any dish yet. Foie gras Yakitori was my friend's second favorite dish at your restaurant. She loved the deep flavor and the creamy texture of the foie gras. If the cholesterol of foie gras was not high, she would have ordered another piece. Her only disappointment at Raku was that some pieces of the Kobe beef liver were slightly overcooked and tough. Raku, you not only made my friend happy, but you also made me felt satisfied with my food. I adored the different sauces, spices and side ingredients that are used for Raku's tofu. The various combinations of ginger, soy sauce, sea salt, and green onion made me felt as if I had three different tofu dishes. I wish my grilled eggplant was more flavorful - I had to add an extensive amount of shichimi, green tea sea salt, soy sauce and katsuobushi to enhance the flavor of the eggplant. Nonetheless, I was impressed by the creamy texture of the eggplant. My friend and I decided to give you four stars instead of five stars because neither of us was able to reach the host when we tried to make reservations via the phone. We ended up waiting in front of the restaurant forty minutes in advance, and luckily became the first customers of the day. Raku, you are awesome. Keep up the good work!Yours,MayWOWWWW cooking at it's finest. This place gets rave reviews for a reason. top notch high quality cuisine. Best tofu I've ever had! It's the freshest period! I've never had tofu that tastes like this. Literally melted in my mouth. I ate here off a recommendation from a chef out in my hometown. He said he drove out here just to eat and drove home literally after. I had to make my way here. Foie gras custard ... omg! melting like no other in my mouth! Both tofu dishes - best tofu I've ever had! Recommendation: The entire menu!Raku is consistently great!  It is easily one of my favorites in town!As a kid I practice Judu. I had a Sensei that used to say "spread the spirit of nurturing rightness." I had no idea what he meant then and I'm still trying to figure it out now. I do know that Raku is doing a lot right when it comes to incredibly delicious dishes!...they are probably ahead of me in spreading the spirit of nurturing rightness. I'm okay with that, but if you haven't shared in this experience you might want to get in on what they're nurturing over there because it is downright scrumptious!Some of the standards that we usually go with include:Udon Noodle with Foie Gras Egg Custard Soup (I adore this...one of those items you crave days later)Cold Green Tea Soba with Poarched EggKurobuta Pork CheekDuck with Balsamic Soy SauceYellowtail CarpaccioSteamed Foie Gras Egg CustardFish BellyI also really appreciate the following:Agedashi TofuKen² SaladKobe Beef Fillet with WasabiKobe Beef Outside Skirt with GarlicButter Sautéed Scallop with Soy SauceAnd for us, no visit would be complete with a few orders of their skewered veggies & mushrooms...you can get them wrapped in bacon, but they are beautiful on their own.Dessert offers some excellent options, including Melting Chocolate Cake and Green Tea Crème Brulée...but if you've taken the time to come here why not spend a little more time in the same shopping center and go to Sweets Raku for a complete experience?...unless you ate too much at Raku of course. Oh, and speaking of complete experiences, you can always opt to partake in one of their Omakase options that go for $75 or $100 per person.Be sure to check out the special board for some truly pleasing selections...these will typically run you a little more, but are often incredible.  There are places I like as much as Raku, but not many that I like more for my money...it is easy in this town to spend two or three times as much for the same quality and execution of food. In fact I'm not sure I'd argue with someone that said Raku is the best for the money in Vegas.Come here...make some reservations first, but come here!Items Selected:Red Sea Breem (Renko Dai) - Sashimi with pickled chrysanthemum, glass noodles, crispy skinJuicy Deep Fried Asajimie Chicken with Spinach and YuzuCrispy Pig's EarKurobuta Pork Belly in Broth with Braised Greens1/2 Agadashi Tofu with Ikura, Mushroom DashiYellowtail Belly with Ponzu and DaikonRed Sea Breem (Renko Dai) - Fried, in Mushroom DashiSteamed Foie Gras Egg CustardApple Cider Lamb ChopPork CheekDuck with Balsamic SoyGreen Tea Soba with Poached EggHot TeaNot visited since 2009, when visiting as a tourist and unadvisedly walking from-and-back-to The Strip, it was finally at the close of 2014 that a return visit to Raku was planned and although three visits to its Sweets sister just down the way have proven universally stellar over the past 18 months a walk-in seat in one of the expanded private rooms proved a slightly less than ideal experience, the service almost non-existent for the first fourty-five minutes while a few of the plates lacked the luster some would suggest overrides every single thing on Mitsuo Endo's somewhat stagnant menu.Undoubtedly the most upscale Izakaya...or Aburiya...in a city where the genre has expanded substantially since Raku opened its doors it was in a small line that our party stood until the door was unlocked at six o'clock and inquiring as to whether reservations were full it was explained that a four-top was available, provided an exit by 7:30 when the next party was due...our much delayed order assuring an exit closer to 8:45, a time in which no less than three similar tables still sat empty leading one to wonder why the bar area was still jam packed.Featuring perhaps fifty plates familiar from a visit five years prior, plus seven chalkboard specials from which the Sea Breem duo was selected, it was just after 7:50 when our fist bites hit the table and with silky fish set against bites of wood-fired skin plus an assortment of accoutrements the flavor profile was delicate and nuanced, the follow-up fried chicken exactly the opposite with an overhead smash of flavor beneath light tempura as a light salad beneath served as an admirable foil to the of the bird.Onward to pork, first crispy ear and then supple belly, suffice it to say that both were quite tasty though somewhat unremarkable in a world where both are frequently offered on all sorts of menus but moving onward to the restaurant's signature tofu I will admit that their suggestion of it being the 'best' is not at all hyperbole, the light tempura overlying an airy omelet bathed in dashi singlehandedly reinventing an ingredient generally nowhere near as enthralling as bursting salmon roe and wakami added texture and brine.At this point treated to a fried fish duo in which the yellowtail belly proved a bit dried out and a step in the wrong direction from simply doing it raw it was undoubtedly the second half of the aforementioned breem that stole the show and served in the same broth as the tofu with everything from skin to bones edible quick work was made of the bowl, the follow-up chawanmushi topped with foie gras another umami-laden dish slightly compromised in texture by overcooked liver, though the custard itself was divine.Rounding out the meal with three grilled items, the lamb chop and pork cheek intense with wood and smoke while the duck got lost in the soy, plus a bowl of chilled soba draped in a perfectly poached egg it was only here that the table was informed that the uni dish ordered could not be prepared because the restaurant was 'out of urchin' and opting against desserts as only cheesecake, crème brûlée, and sorbet were offered it was with tea that the night came to a close - the $66 per person tab an admitted deal compared to strip prices, though the overall experience failed to meet the highs offered by some of Las Vegas Boulevard's bests, a bit of a change from 2009 no matter what some may say of the emergence of Spring Mountain Road.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Perhaps an effect of having now eaten at some of the world's best, including places like SAISON where pristine ingredients cooked over an open flame have taken on a whole new degree of creativity and skill, there is little doubt that those visiting Raku are guaranteed to have a good meal yet with so little change on the menu in a city where evolution is the rule it will be some time before I find myself rushing back...at least not until a few more Izakaya are visited to see if there is a more impressive experience to be found.After two more visits to Raku since my last review, it deserves another update.  I'm not going to dive too much into this review because you all already know this place is good, especially if you've read my past reviews.  Service is still top notch and the food is still impeccable.But I will share with you some of the highlights during those two visits.Raku Tofu --  http://bit.ly/1zaxEXbNo matter how many times I order this, I'm always blown away by how creamy Raku's cold tofu is.Juicy Deep Fried Chicken -- http://bit.ly/1p0X6cDThis is not your usual Chicken Karaage.  It's better!  It's literally very juicy and very flavorful along with the crispy skin.Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard -- http://bit.ly/1zayovvAlong with the Raku Tofu, this is still a MUST ORDER and also my personal favorite.Foie Gras Rice Bowl --  http://bit.ly/1kEv43IBig hunk of Foie Gras over rice.  It's a good thing to order if you don't get the custard.Duck with Balsamic Soy --  http://bit.ly/1v66omuI saw this on their Facebook page and it looked and sounded really good.  The duck was cooked nicely.Kobe Beef w/ Wasabi --  http://bit.ly/1zaxRtCTheir Kobe Beef yakitori are always amazing.  And this one of course has a nice kick with the fresh wasabi.Oyako Don --  http://bit.ly/1v666fdIf you've followed my reviews and pics before, you probably know that lately I've been on an Oyako Don hunt.  Raku's is good and filling, but pretty much is the same as the other places I've had it, and that's not a bad thing.Also on a side note, I don't think I've actually mentioned this before in my past reviews, but their toilet is awesome!  -- http://bit.ly/1v65K8oIt has a heated seat and cleaning controls are above the handrail.  It's an experience you have to try!  Seriously!As you can see Raku still delivers and is still my favorite Japanese restaurant of all time.  I was a little worried when Anthony Bourdain taped his show here thinking that the added exposure would make it harder to land a table here but that hasn't been the case with my last pair of visits.  For that I'm glad because for me, a foodie trip to Vegas without Raku would be so incomplete.Awful customer service.   Made a potential 5 star experience turn into 3.  Did not have reservations so we sat at the bar. Didn't realize there was a specials menu until we saw a server carry the black board over to a different guest sitting at the bar.  Someone sat next to us and we kindly asked if they didn't mind scooting down one, as someone else would be joining us.  The server came over upset and rude telling us that we can't do that, even though he was willing to move. She told us that the host needs to know.  When we tried to ask the host he was too busy to care and said he would come back. Within less than 5 min our friend arrived so we stood at the bar waiting. The host did not offer a seat until our friend already walked out the door because of the poor service. The seat he offered was opposite of the guest who was sitting alone. They would really seat us apart from eachother?!  Really was a downer on our evening. And tonight was the one night in 2 years that my friend and I had together. Really stuck up here.  A shame the food was decent. Sashimi salad was good if you are looking for something raw. Yellowtail was good quality fish, but I've had it better prepared elsewhere. The item that stands out the best are Wagyu skewers tender, flavorful, and the fat of it just melts. We ordered all the desserts. The cheesecake was worth getting, light with a chocolate crust. The chef tried to make up for the service. He was much kinder and served us water when the waitress wouldn't come by.  For the price, and experience there was nothing on the menu worth coming back for.  Had it not been for how we were treated there would have been other items I would like to come back and  try. I appreciate great food and don't mind spending to have a good time. To spend that kind of money where they are not kind or accommodating isn't worth it. They put us in a bad mood.Raku is one of those Vegas-exclusive dining experiences every local has to have at least once. I lived here nearly a year and a half and finally found an occasion worthy of a family dinner at Raku. AppetizersRaku's Tofu: worth at least trying, great silky textureKobe Beef Liver Sashimi: there's no getting around the strong liver taste, it's not for everyone. The roasted garlic chips add flavor and texture.Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard: great dish, minimal foie but still very enjoyable. There was also some roe in this that we hadn't expected.Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe: This dish wasn't for me at all. I like poached eggs, and urchin, and roe, but this didn't come together and the egg was closer to raw than poached.Juicy Deep Fried Chicken: an incredible introduction to the wonderful chicken dishes Raku's kitchen puts out, even the spinach garnish was deliciousRice & NoodleGrilled Rice Ball in Broth with Salmon: Great pick. Light broth that tasted more like a tea due to the steeped seaweed in the dish. Rice retains the grilled texture despite being soaked in broth. Salmon surcharge was $3 but piece of fish was the size of a thumb nail, didn't contribute anything to the flavor.RobataChicken Thigh & Chicken Breast Wrapped with Chicken Skin: the chicken robata dishes were my favorites, with a smoky grilled taste and juicy beyond beliefKobe Beef Filet with Wasabi: the beef was good, but I'm not a fan of wasabi so that kind of ruined this for meKobe Beef Tendon: nope. not happening. too adventurous for me.Pork Ear: Tasty with lots of texture. Server recommends their spicy table sauce, which was basically a punch of straight-up pepper. I'd recommend it without.Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce: Ordered two of these knowing I'd love it, and I did. Lacked the gamey taste that turns a lot of people off to duck. Good choice.Tomato with Bacon & Mushroom with Bacon: I'm not generally a bacon fan, but adding a veggie into the mix somehow does it for me. DessertFluffy Cheesecake: I'm not a dessert fan, and found this a bit too cheesy for me, but when you get to the raspberry filling? Oh man, all bets are off. Above meal was under $200 with a carafe of Ashahi ($30) and tip, and enough for three to share happily. Service was just okay, polite and professional but detached and didn't make a connection or any recommendations even when we mentioned it was our first visit. Make sure to take at least one trip to the bathroom, it's beautiful.We made reservations a few days in advance, and staff were awesome about calling us back when they were unable to pick up. Reservations secure your table for 15 minutes (show up on time!), and you get the table for 2 hours. Toward the end of the night (11PM?) people were able to walk-in for bar seats.Another visit to Raku and had another stellar experience at the kitchen bar.  One thing that I tried to do different this time was to order things I've haven't had before.  Even though I've been to Raku five times already, there were still plenty more things on and off their menu that I've yet to try.On to the food.  So pretty much everything except for the last two items were all new dishes for me.Mushoom Salad Complimentary Appetizer -- http://bit.ly/1BCj0L6This was their amuse-bouche for the day.  I love mushrooms so this was a very good way to start off my dinner.Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe -- http://bit.ly/1GYp7JQNot only was this appetizer photogenic, it was really good!  Of course anything with a runny egg is good in my book.  And the uni and roe combo was creamy and surprisingly not too salty.  I'd would definitely order this again!Braised Abalone Special with Dashi Gravy -- http://bit.ly/1ex5NsVThis was off of their specials board.  And I'm glad I ordered it.  I have never had abalone before so this was a new experience for me.  The abalone was grilled, sliced up, and smothered with gravy.  I was thinking that it was going to have a very strong fishy taste, but that wasn't the case.  It was almost like eating a lobster or monkfish where it had a chewy texture and it would take a long time to chew out the flavor which had a lot of umami thanks to the dashi gravy.  Delicious!Grilled Langoustine -- http://bit.ly/1GxVpdaAs I was eating my appetizer, I was peering over to their seafood table behind the bar and saw these amazing looking Langoustines.  I had to have one so immediately ordered it.  It was good!  The Langoustine was grilled to perfection where it was easily removable from the shell and the meat was very tender and flavorful.  It was worth the impulsive splurge.Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce -- http://bit.ly/1I4MPoLI ordered this last time I here and it was still just as good.  The duck was grilled nicely and had a very rich flavor with the Balsamic Soy Sauce.Grilled Foie Gras with Black Garlic and Glazed Soy-based Sauce -- http://bit.ly/1Ncae7DWhat better way to finish my meal off than with a stick of their famous grilled foie gras.  It actually has been a while since I last ordered this so I figured it was worth another go around.  They really don't hold back with the portion size as you can see from the pic.  It's a very generous sized piece of foie gras.  And it was so good.  I love how they include a piece of black garlic to give it a more intense flavor.  I'll be alternating between this and their Foie Gras Steamed Custard from now on.  As much as I'd like to have both as the same time, it'd be better for me to keep them separate since they're equally rich and exquisite.Raku does it again for me with their great service and impressive dishes.  I'm so happy to see that business is still doing well for them.  Reservations are still hard to get here as I found that out from another customer that she made her reservation almost a month in advance.  Hopefully with their recently announced expansion, it'll be much easier to get a reservation and should provide more tables for walk-ins as well.  There's still plenty more for me to try at Raku, so expect another review from me in the near future.FINALLYI have had Raku in my cross hairs for many, many years.  The idea of finding parking in an extremely under sized lot without street parking and waiting outside in the sweltering heat amongst smoking fiends was an absolute deterrent.  But lately my commute schedule forces me to look for restaurants opened pass midnight.  Gambled that a midnight attempt during a Thursday would be in our favor. Good thing I made the call first hand from McCarran and followed up with a reservation.  Without having to wait, we were seated promptly in the first dining room that includes the vista of the bar, kitchen service window and everyone entering the restaurant.  The other half or adjacent room has at least one private room and other seating arrangements plus their single unisex restroom.The two sided menu is cleverly sandwiched in glass and housed in a slot holster at each table.  Majority of the diners are newbies and studiously referencing to their smartphones for eye catching suggestions on Yelp.  Don't be embarrassed. ... we're doing the same too.  There are just too many tempting menu items. We ordered seven items with the Fried Chicken as a last moment add on and eighth and last item.Cold  Dishes:Homemade Tofu - Raku Whole order served with a side of chili garlic sauce and Japanese mustard green ... uniquely Raku's .... dense, slightly cream like experienceWaygu Beef Sashimi with special blended soy sauce (not on menu, by request only) ...  beef eater's dream come trueYellowtail Carpaccio served with special , soy sauce blend topped with yuzu and daikon ... every table orderedPoached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe ...  you will live to be 110 years old ... very popular amongst male dinersHot Dishes:Kurobuta Pork Belly with spinach and mustard on top ... must eat together with all ingredients for total satisfactionSteamed Foie Gras Egg Custard with grilled duck on top ... is your tongue long enough to touch the bottom of your cup ?Juicy Deep Fried Chicken (not on menu, by request only)  ...  assured  a filling and grand experienceRobata Grill Butter Sauteed Scallop ... only dish that failed to stoke my taste buds ... scallop was over cooked and partially chewy and tough.Unfortunately, the very pretty lady reading the chalkboard specials had a very thick Japanese accent and we didn't understand most of what she was attempting to promote. The ambiance is simple and strong, while ceiling pinpoint table lighting greatly assisted in reading the small print on the menu and made food photography a cinch.  All in all it was a very memorable dining experience and essentially fulfillled my expectations of what is deemed refined Japanese cuisine.This is my review #666.4.5 STARSDuring my last trip to Vegas in January, I wanted to try Raku, but I couldn't get a same day reservation. This last trip, I made sure to call ahead and reserve a spot. We had dinner here on Thursday, July 9th at 10pm. We were a party of 5 and shared everything.We all got hot tea: Hoji cha tea ($2.50ea) and a bottle of sake to share: Shichihonyari "seven spears men", junmai nama genshu, prefecture: shiga ($80 bottle). Description of sake from menu: "This is a very drinkable but complex limited released unpasteurized sake has the prototypical sake brewery aroma that is like a wet collection of steamed rice, green grasses, yeast and green apples. A nama that actually tastes like rice, which is a rarity these days." I don't know much about sake, but this was dry enough for me to drink. And I was sold when they said limited release!Specials:*Wagyu sashimi ($20)*Bluefin / Negitoro ($31)*King crab ($20)I loved the wagyu and sashimi! These were my favorites out of the specials. The wagyu melted in my mouth and the sashimi was super fresh. I'd skip the king crab next time as it was just a grilled leg. It was good, but nothing special.Cold dish:*Kobe beef liver sashimi ($9.50)*Yellowtail carpaccio ($12)*Poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe ($9) x2Yellowtail carpaccio is a must! So tender. The uni dish is super rich. I enjoyed the first bite, but it needed something to cut through the richness as I continued eating it. I wasn't a fan of the liver sashimi as raw liver isn't really appealing to me.Hot dish:*Steamed foie gras egg custard ($10) x2*Agedashi fish belly: Hamachi belly ($18), Agadashi belly (+$5)I was in heaven with the steam foie gras custard. Omg! The silky custard with the delicately seared foie?! Sooo good! All flavors I adore. The agedashi fish belly was okay. I thought it wasn't crispy enough and a little mushy. Though I'm not sure if we waited too long to eat it. Sake will do that to you!Robata grill:*Kobe beef outside skirt with garlic ($7.50) x3*Kurobuta pork cheek ($4.25) x3*Duck with balsamic soy sauce ($4.50) x3*Foie gras with glazed soy-based sauce ($17.50) x3For 5 people, 3 skewers per order were perfect. We were here to try a bunch of dishes, so half a skewer allowed for a bite or two of each item. I'm a foie addict, so of course I loved the foie! Seared to perfection. I also loved the pork cheek. Super tender. I also enjoyed the beef and duck. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the skewers they offered. All had a nice smoky flavor and were delicious!Rice/Noodle/Soup:*Cold green tea soba with poached egg ($8.50)This was my least favorite dish. I don't really enjoy cold noodles, so I didn't find this appetizing at all. I think cold noodles are supposed to be refreshing, but I just don't get it. I've enjoyed korean cold noodles from time to time, but they have a nice vinegar and spicy flavor. This didn't have that.Yay, I finally tried Raku! Did it live up to the hype?! Definitely with certain dishes! I adored all the foie, carpaccio, sashimi and skewers. Some missed the mark for me, but I think it was more about taste preference than anything else. I'm a little sad we didn't try any of their tofu as I believe that is one of their specialties. Next time Raku, next time!First, we got a private room off the main dining room which was really awesome.  It was a small room with one table just for us (I believe they have 2 of these).  All of the portions are small but tasty and I got to try a lot of new things, really high quality food with great taste.  Juicy meat, delicious vegetables, so much variety to try!  The tofu is a must.

Restaurant name  Pizza a Metro
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The BEST Italian food outside of NYC or Italy itself! This place is so unexpected it's amazing. It's a tiny little restaurant at the end of a strip mall located just East of I-17 (look for it on the North side of the road next to a hair salon and Circle K). You cannot let the location fool you... this place is great. I heard it rumored that the owner was an executive chef at some foo-foo place in Scottsdale that had creative differences with the management, so he left to open his own place. I didn't have the courage to ask him, but he is straight out of Napoli and the food is fresh and exciting.I took two friends and we literally were fighting over who had the better food. It was so good that we had each picked out at least four more entrees that we wanted to come back for and were scheduling out visits to accommodate a goal to try every single item! I mean seriously there was no table talk or chit chat... all we talked about was the food.Pizza A Metro only has a handful of tables, but when you walk in the door they start baking the most amazing Italian Flat Bread in their wood brick oven. It's served with a cold side of sauteed onions, eggplant, black olives and capers. The topping is good enough to eat straight out of the bowl and the bread is tender and hot. We ended our meal with a serving of homemade Tiramisu that was so orgasmically good, you could literally spread it over your naked body, lick it off and call it a night!In addition to an extensive menu, they have two specials that change daily. Entrees are moderately priced between 7.95 and 8.95, the pastas are homemade and many can be interchanged with the various sauces or toppings of your liking. In addition to the pasta and meat selections they have an assortment of soups/salads/starters and several pizzas/calzones. Portions are large and filling (for example the "Metro" sized pizza is literally 39 inches across - seriously the guy showed me!).For all you CenPho folks, they deliver from 35th Ave to Central and Camelback to Buckeye. They are open Monday - Thursday from 11:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Friday - Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.The only downside that I could find (other than the limited table space) was that they don't serve liquor. But they do encourage b.y.o. and will cork it for you table-side.This is the kind of place that Yelp was designed for. A local hole in the wall that serves mind blowing food and no one knows about. Please please please visit this place because it's only six blocks from my house and now that I know they are there I can't imagine them going out of business.  : )06/05/2008 Update: Okay I officially have a problem because I have now eaten at this place 5 times in the last two weeks, have sampled about 60% of their menu and am convinced that when introducing myself it should go something like this: "Hi my name is Julie and I am a Pizza A Metro addict." Are there any 12 step groups for a restaurant junkie???Pizza a Metro? A better name would be "Italian Nirvana." if you ask me. Everything Hubby and I had last night was outrageously delicious, super fresh, and very reasonably priced. The owner, Maurizio, is as charming and warm as his first tiny restaurant.We started with a Caprese salad, with a beautiful house-made mozzarella and wonderful tomatoes, sprinkled with pieces of fresh basil, fresh pepper, and oil and vinegar to add according to our own liking (much appreciated, as I always order dressing on the side, and like to um... taste my salad). Accompanying this was a dish of freshly made flat bread, warm and well-seasoned, it was crispy in parts and chewy in others- all yummy. It came with a relish, but since I learned from Julie P. it had eggplant (I have a serious sensitivity), it was all Hubby's and he loved it.Hubby ordered a small Capricciosa pizza which was the size of a medium at regular pizza places. He nearly wept with joy at how perfect it was- and that there was now a place where I would happily let him "get his pizza on" without any protest. I had the Pollo al Marsala. It was such a large piece of chicken breast I couldn't finish it, and came with plenty of tender mushrooms, and a rich Marsala sauce so good that I kept sopping it up with the few pieces of leftover bread we had. Somehow, Maurizio convinced us to try a dessert, and we chose the cannoli. It was fresh and creamy, dotted with chocolate pieces inside. There was not much chit chat- just inhaling.I mentioned that I was so glad I had heard about Pizza a Metro, and this led to my introducing Maurizio to Yelp. He planned on looking up what we had said that night, and talked about how he was trying to get restaurant reviewers from the Republic and New Times to come, as this was a tough location. If any Yelpers have an "in" at any of the papers, maybe you can suggest a visit to this absolute gem. He used to be at the oft awarded Tutti Santi, but once the word spreads about Pizza a Metro, the "Best Italian" awards will be his instead.I hate to jump on the bandwagon. But dang it, folks are right about this place!We lurked around the front door this morning long enough for Mauricio to invite us in. Pizza A Metro sticks out like a sore thumb in this dirty old stripmall off the 17. It's clean and crisp on the outside, warm and inviting on the inside. Soccer was on the tele, and the kitchen crew was busy prepping for the lunch rush. We sat at one of the granite-topped tables and ordered a few bevvies. FYI, sodas come in 20 oz bottles, so while they are tastier than fountain, they are a bit more money.We started off with a caesar salad. The dressing was spot-on, with just the right amount of anchovy. However it had no croutons, and could use some bigger parm bits.We also enjoyed some really tasty sorta bruschetta things. They appeared to be scraps of pizza crust, accompanied by a sweet onion relish with -- I believe -- eggplant, celery, and a couple of fat capers and olive slices. As an olive-hater, I found this to be a refreshing change from tapenade.Next we had the lasagne and a small pizza with prosciutto, mozz, and arugula. The "small" was HUGE! The crust was kind of on the thin side, and had a delicious chewiness to crustiness ratio. On the downside, I totally got shafted on the arugula. Instead, it was topped with spring mix. Not bad, but the bite of arugula would have been better.The lasagna was delish. The sauce was probably the best part - lots of tomato and basil, and just the right amount of garlic.Sadly, I was too full and tired for dessert. And good news for you Scottsdalians. We were told he's opening another shop up your way.So we're driving home from work today; ready to face the nasty rush hour traffic, when my husband tells me that there's a new place we have to try; Pizza A Metro.  He's a fan of the New Times, and particularly loves to read Savage Love...Hmmm?  He read a review on this relatively new restaurant which had very favorable comments.  Anyway, we LOVE to eat and are willing to go anywhere for good food.  Lucky for us, we work downtown and Pizza A Metro was within minutes.  The question was "should we go home and eat Cocoa Pebbles for dinner or experience, what we would later that evening call "The Best" Italian restaurant in this city?  The question; ridiculous; the choice was obvious.First we entered the tiny strip mall just East of I-17 on Thomas where this teeny little restaurant  sits.  Seriously though, if you blink you might miss it, so keep your eyes peeled.  The restaurant inside was really cute and super clean.  The few tables in the place were granite...nice touch.  Greeting us immediately was the owner, who was so welcoming and highly attentive.   We began our meal with complementary flat bread that was fresh from the brick oven with a side of eggplant componata as a spread.  Both were so incredibly delicious, and truly set the tone for the rest of the meal that was to come.  We had the Calamari Fritti appetizer which was accompanied with the most amazing marinara dipping sauce.  My husband ordered a "small" pizza that's big enough for two people to share: a piping hot, beautiful wood fired pizza crust layered with red sauce, delicious, melty mozzarella, amazing sliced sausage and rapini.  Needless to say, the pizza was out of this world!Ok, so just when I thought it couldn't get any better, I tasted my eggplant Parmesan that came with a side of pasta with marinara .  Honestly, this was sooo good that I thought I was going to cry.  I can't even put into words how delicious this dish was.  I really had to savor every bite and relish in the smooth eggplant that was covered with a blanket of mozzarella and divine marinara.  It was just sinfully good.  This was truly a decadent feast with very reasonable prices.  I even got to practice my Italian with the owner.  If you haven't been, you must go and support this tiny restaurant.  Other than it's weird location, I couldn't find anything wrong with Pizza A Metro, as everything was oh so right.  Buon Apetito!!Fucking GREAT pizza!  This place rivals Cibo for my favorite pizza in town.  I had a cheese and peperoni pie.  The peperoni was spicy but not over riding so. That sauce was very fruity, the crust perfectly crispy yet soft and flexible.   Wow.The restaurant is very small and tucked into a dirty little strip mall but the inside is nice.  If you love pizza I think you'll LOVE this place.  YUM!So curious me, I had to see what all the Yelpabaloo was about (yeah, that's a new Yelp-ism - be sure to jot it down for your next review), and I must admit, this place lived up to the hype for me. It's a little outside my normal dining zone, but since I was downtown with my lil bro seeing a movie at Arizona Center, we decided to stop by on our way home.The vegetarian pizza was delicious. Loaded with fresh veggies, including artichoke hearts, on top of an incredible thin & crispy crust, I just wish I'd ordered a larger size so I'd have more leftovers. Don't get me wrong, the portions are generous, I just wanted more.There's definitely more on the menu than pizza, including pasta and calzones, which, after watching a few being served around me and listening to the oohs and ahhs while they were consumed, I will definitely be ordering next time.The place is small - very small, less than a dozen tables - so I imagine it probably fills up quickly in the evenings. So small in fact that several conversations were restaurant wide - creating quite the communal dining experience - one of which involved Yelp. The owner's a big fan, as several patrons including myself mentioned it as their reason for checking them out.My lil bro's review: "Awesome." The only thing that would have made it better, he said, were video games. Who can argue with that?There it was; cornered with the ratty Circle K that obviously needs the armed gaurd outside. Their sign in comparison was claaaassssy. Once inside you realize this is going to go one of two ways, and obviously based on all previous reviews it went the right way.Our server had classically italian shoes, and Anthony Bourdain hair. Mixed with his jovial european attitude and accent, he was perfectly cool as all get out.I felt like Tony Soprano, if The Sopranos was written by Kevin Smith and the mobsters discussed comic books with their generally bandanad currently little black dressed friend Amanda B.The atmosphere is quaint and the food would help you get over the death of your italian grandmother. The pizza is divine, The imperfect look of the lasagna says this is going to be better than making out with the head cheerleader behind the bleachers in high school (I assume. I talk about comic books so this has never happened to me).The raw beef whatcha call it, while not for everyone, is it for me. Perfectly lemony, perfectly fresh, perfectly refreshing and tasty. The table behind us had brought their own wine, which I will certainly do next time and assume that if there is a corking fee it is resonable.Speaking of reasonable, the prices were incredibly low for the quality of the food. Must have something to do with the heavily gaurded circle k next door.My BFF and I played hookie today to lunch it up. As always the food is out of this world good. In fact, during desert, she actually schooshed me, because she was having a moment with the tiramisu. Normally I wouldn't add this sort of thing to a review, but seriously... she schooshed me! PAM will now be open from noon to 8:30 on Sundays. They are staffing up for the opening of their Scottsdale location and the place is all a buzz. Although you can generally get in with little or no wait during lunch, you would be smart to call ahead or make a reservation for dinner. Also their liquor license is in process, but you can still BYO.Italian was my unofficial and official second major in college. I studied in Rome for three months and Florence for three months and went back several times after to experience the magic all over again. While I was there, I learned many things about Italian culture and solidified my language skills, but as you can imagine, the thing that I found the most exciting and educational was the Italians' relationship with food.  Regardless of the region I was in, I found Italians united by shared beliefs about food preparation and eating, many of which were foreign to me prior to going. As an example, all the Italians I met took it as a given that: salad comes after a meal, not before it; fresh fruit is a dessert, not a snack or breakfast; alfredo sauce and mozzarella sticks are not Italian; alcohol exists to enhance the flavors of food, not to get drunk; and pepperoni is not thin slices of cured pork, but peppers - you know, the vegetables (this one blew my mind the most!). You get the idea. Of course, these guidelines come across to Americans as strict rules. We love our culinary freedom, and that makes sense - we have many different types of food, types of people, and types of lifestyles. Plus, Italian food changed a lot at the hands of the immigrants who came here. However, even if I'm not going to follow every guideline, I took from my experiences in Italy a sense of genuine appreciation for simple, fresh flavors, a desire to slow down and truly enjoy what I'm eating, and a greater awareness of the way that different dietary components come together to create a balanced diet and better internal functioning.Since I got back, I've found few Italian restaurants that really embody these key principles, refusing to dumb down or speed up their food for the American masses. Well, Pizza A Metro is part of that elite category, and I'm thrilled to have found it here in Phoenix, just a short drive from our house. Maurizio makes it his goal to serve his customers fresh, simple, carefully-prepared food that allows the flavors of individual ingredients to shine. I appreciate that so much. We checked the place out for the first time last Friday night. We had made a reservation in advance, which was a great idea because we only had to wait 2-3 minutes to be seated once we arrived. We were promptly greeted by Maurizio and quickly had our drink order taken by the server. I was a little nervous about speaking Italian, since I'm pretty rusty, but I figured I should, since I haven't got many chances to do so in California, where I grew up, or here in Phoenix. So, when Maurizio returned with our bread basket and to take our order, I worked up my courage and ordered in Italian. Even though he was super-busy, Maurizio asked me a few questions back in Italian (where did I study, etc.) and continued to converse with us in Italian throughout the rest of the meal. It was so much fun for me to speak again, especially when the food was so delicious and really took me back to my study abroad time. We decided to start with the grilled calamari and then have the Penne Amatriciana and a medium Pizza Frescolina. The bread basket was phenomenal, with lightly oiled pieces of Italian flatbread with a cold mixture of eggplant, olives, and onions (almost like an Italian ratatouille). When the calamari arrived, we discovered that it was fried and not grilled (both are appetizer options; grilled is more prominent in Italy), but we decided not to say anything and eat it anyway. We were glad we did because it reminded me of the seafood "fritti misti" you get in Italy - just lightly battered with a hint of seasoning. It came with a tomato sauce, but it was delicious with just a squeeze of lemon. Our entrees were even more delicious. My pasta could have been a bit more al dente, probably because most Americans don't eat it that way, but no harm done - I'll just order it that way next time. The sauce was incredible and truly authentic. It perfectly combined fresh tomatoes, tender pieces of pancetta, onion, garlic, and olive oil without being too thick or sweet. The pizza was also to die-for with a thin, flour-brushed crust, small amounts of milky mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and arugula, and salty prosciutto. Just like Italian pies, all the flavors were balanced and no single one was overwhelming. So you know, the medium was huge and even with our huge appetite we ended up taking 3-4 slices home.All in all, we only spent $30 or so and had an amazing, deeply satisfying meal that brought me back to my memorable time in Italy. I absolutely can't wait to go back and try more things (and practice my Italian again!).I need more of this pizza, you hear me, MORE!I have to admit after reading these reviews here, I had higher expectations for this restaurant than probably anywhere else I've been. For the most part, Pizza A Metro lived up to the expectations.  In some ways, it even exceeded.We ordered the gnocchi and whatever pizza had the artichokes on it, and split everything. It was all delicious. The dough has the perfect flavor, and with what other reviews said, it was definitely cooked with tap water. Spend any time in NYC and you will realize that all great pizza is cooked with shitty tap water, and that makes or breaks the pizza. The gnocchi was amazingly light, fluffy, and had a great sauce. I don't care how small a portion it was, it was fucking delicious. Even the bread before the meal was better than I expected, with a delicious mix of eggplant, olives, onions, and good. I counted exactly 20 seats, so this is a b a d place for groups, and it was all but deserted on a monday night. Good for us, we got our food quickly, and had a good time. I ordered a canoli before we left and wolfed that son of a bitch in about 3 seconds. Perfect flavors of amaretto and chocolate. The night went great, and I will definitely go back here plenty of times. One bite of the pizza and I knew it was my new favorite in town. I now go in this order 1. Metro 2. Bianco 3. Cibo 4. NYPD 5. GrazieSo, my friend Angie and I were looking for a casual place to dine on Saturday night, and I suggested we try Pizza a Metro.  I've seen that a lot of fellow Yelpers have gone here, and its recieved quite a few reviews.  So, I call the place to confirm where they are located, and what time they are open until.  A nice gentleman with an Italian accent answered the phone, and was so friendly and helpful!  I loved it!  So, I drive there, and like the gentleman said, he was right off the expressway next to a circle K.  What shocked me at first was a few things.  First, its a tiny little parking lot, and its shared with a circle K.  I found this interesting.  Fortunately, there was parking available, so I waited for my friend to arrive.  The second surprise that I had was just how small this place was.  Interesting.  I guess if you had a larger party (more then 4 people) you would definately NEED to call in a reservation, as its a very limited seating arrangement.When my friend finally arrived, all the seats were taken, and I was greeted by the gentleman with the thick Italian accent.  He told me that it would be about a 7 minute wait, so my friend and I waited outside in the parking lot.   The wait ended up being more about 10 minutes, maybe 15 tops.  Not bad.When we were seated, we really liked the place.  Theres a firebrick oven where people were cooking pizzas.  There was also other workers that you could see preparing other foods.  Somewhat of an open kitchen feel.  the service was great.  I believe this place is owned and operated by this Italian family.  they most be brothers, because periodically throughout the evening, they were speaking in Italian to each other.  I think it really added to the evening, and made the place feel much more authentic.We ended up ordering our food, and even tho I was not extremely hungry, my friend was.   I went with a Cesar Salad, and my friend went with the Cheese Ravioli.  We were given some complimentary appitizers which were bread chunks and red sauce. Tasty!  We both ordered pops, which were brought out and poured for us...but they were from those 20 ounce pop bottles that you would get at a local store...not from a fountian. I found this interesting.Angie really enjoyed her Ravioli, but I felt like my salad was a little soggy.  Sitll edable, just a little to much dressing.  The food here seems to be good, and I think its also the ambiance and guys that run the show that make dining here worthwhile.  I would bring friends or family here who are in from out of town, becuase I think its one of those more authentic experiences.Anyways, the service was wonderful.  Truely a gem, and much more fun and authentic then most places I have been for pizza and pasta lately.I had a really hard time deciding between 4 and 5 and I decided to go with 5 because for the first time in my life, I ate my leftovers  :)First of all, this place is completely unexpected. Being next to a ghetto Circle K in a not-so-good part of town, I was not expecting the high quality of food and service that we received. Needless to say, I was really impressed.We started with the Margharita pizza and I must say, I have not had better. That is surprising because I ate pizza twice in New York in August.  For my entree I had the spaghetti pomodoro. Normally I prefer a capellini pasta with this type of sauce, but I was really impressed. Honestly, I wanted to just sit and smell it all night long!We were so stuffed after the pizza/entree, but Michael insisted (heavily) that we try the tiramisu. It was DIVINE! Normally I would be angry at a server for forcing me to order something I didn't want, but I will excuse him this time.I really like how proud they are that they make everything from scratch, fresh. Even the desserts. I am also excited that they are opening up an additional location in Scottsdale!On a side note, they have REALLY cute plates and bowls!!  :) I cannot believe it took me this long to get to Pizza A Metro, especially since it is the first place I ever bookmarked on Yelp!I will be back. Many, many times!Why is it that the best places are a little hard to find? In a little bit of a sketched out area?Some people call them diamonds in the rough. I would just call them restaurants in phoenix. Sunday I went to Pizza A Metro. I haven't been to this side of town in awhile. I'm CenPho and I hardly ever venture outside my hood. But I keep hearing how great this place is and was feelin some pizza. First thing I noticed when I entered the door...I've seen larger hot dog carts. The atmosphere is super cozy, seating is comfortable and we didn't need to wait long. Already three good things right? Looked over the menu and listened to the daily specials.We opted for the soup of the day, a Caesar salad, some fried calamari and a small pizza.We were not looking to gorge, but definitely wanted to try different things from the menu.Soup of the day was OMG delicious. It was like a frittata in a bowl of soup. Scrambled eggs, spinach, in a chicken broth with sliced meatballs.I almost cleaned the bowl. It was insanely good.Caesar Salad was awesome. Crispy lettuce not overly dressed. A very good salad.The fried calamari was excellent. Not overly fried, lightly battered and golden fried. Not too dark, not too crunchy. Dipping sauce was good, but found just some lemon and they were awesome.We ordered a small pizza and it had artichoke, olives, cheese, ham and it was awesome.After all the rest of the food I ate, just had a few small slices and took the rest home.Everything was wonderful. I give this place 6 stars. But since 5 is the max...deal with it.We took mom there for her b-day tonight. Just a chill evening with good food, nothing pretentious, nothing outlandish, nothing crowded, nothing chain. We loved it. She choose Margarita pizza, Cheese ravioli, Cesar salad. The bread they serve before the meal was amazing.The salad was cold and crisp with a perfect amount of dressing. The Ravioli was the best I have ever had. We even had a surprise Penne Pasta with artichoke and marinara arrive at the table. It was a typo when entering the order. It was really good too. Then for dessert they brought out Creme Brule with a candle!Thanks for the great evening tonight, we loved the food and appreciated the service.You know that episode of Seinfeld where George eats a pastrami sandwich while banging his girlfriend? Well, if he'd been eating Pizza A Metro, I'd totally understand. So. Fucking. Good.My friend and I split the cheese ravioli in a creamy tomato sauce and a pizza with sausage, broccoli and mozzarella for lunch.The ravioli were like little pillows of heaven filled with the silkiest melt-in-your-mouth ricotta I've ever tasted. The pizza had that chewy-crispy crust thing happening, and the tomato sauce was incredible - simple, fresh, still a little pulpy.Everything was homemade. And when I say "everything," I mean they make their own MOZZARELLA, people. Yes, mozzarella. I know how to make a lot of stuff from scratch -- bread, pasta, pastry dough, whatever -- but cheese? I've got no fucking clue. Not only does Pizza A Metro have a clue, but they're so goddamned nice, too. Case in point: After chatting with the owner throughout our meal, he brought out a slice of the tiramisu. No fanfare, no warning. Just set it down and walked away. We practically licked the plate. Go there. You won't be disappointed. But if you see me ordering takeout, just pretend you don't know where I'm headed with it.Great crust, sauce and cheese. Service was good, but it had to be because this place is f'ing tiny so we sat next to the kitchen door and they had to walk by us every 30 seconds.The parts I didn't care for.---No booze, sure you could BYOB, but that's a hassle sometime.---This place has maybe 6 tables, 2 parking spaces, and located next to an oh so romantic Circle K.---We were brought the wrong pizza, (which I started to eat before I noticed) it had sausage and broccoli.  Flavor was good but there was water, NOT OIL, in the center of the pizza.  Obviously the center crust sucked but the rest was very good.---Had some chicken special thingy, good but not 5 star Yelp good.---The Cappricosa (sp?) pizza we ordered arrived it had canned black olives on it, out of the jar artichokes, and basic cubed ham on it. Oh yes, there was water in the center of it too. WTF?We were given a piece of tarimusu because of the mix up, which was great. Thank you.Some of the items I saw come from the kitchen looked really good so I'd go back and maybe get take out or stop in for lunch.So better than average food, but not the best ever.   The location sucks, there is no ambiance at all, and no booze.Three stars from me.   I guess I'm a Cibo kind of guy.We got to introduce 3 "virgins" to the wonders of PaM tonight- and they all agreed it was tremendous and fabulous. The gnocchi was pillowy and perfect, the saltimbocca was tender and rich, the mussels were fat and flavorful, the carbonara was snatched from its orderer and devoured by his girlfriend who loved what she ordered until she tasted his. The bread was great, as always, and the tapenade bowl was scraped clean. The calamari fritti was light and fresh, and one friend exclaimed that the accompanying marinara was the best she'd ever had. Even though they live in East Mesa, they'll be returning for sure. I think those of us who are regulars were concerned when Maurizio left to open Amarone. After all, he was such a big part of the charm and ambiance of the place. Let me tell you, the new GM Michael more than fills his shoes. Charming? You bet. Awesome accent? Check. Kind, accommodating, cool under pressure? Yes, yes, yes. Remembers you and your problems with tomatoes? Always. Tonight, I also brought in a cheesecake I had made for my friend (her favorite, and she now lives out of state) and without missing a beat, Michael offered to put it in the walk-in, even brought it out with candles, then took it back and served it to us on plates he decorated as if it were his own dessert. I was so impressed with his generosity. That's the kind of service and small town feel you get at Pizza a Metro. As long as we live here and the place is open, we'll continue to be regulars.poor execution, no coordination in the kitchen, less than savory ingredients.===What is it about Phoenicians and any pizza not served by Dominos or Pizza Hut? They go gaga for it. They 5-star it. They vote it number one in the nation and it makes Zagat's (clearing throat, then spit).I was excited about this place given all the extremely high reviews and yelp hype; they even have their Yelp window sticker. I arrived without a reservation and my guests and I were seated right away. Service was prompt and the food runner/buser, while very timid, was on the ball refilling our drinks.The thin-crust pizza dough, cut into small pieces for the bread tray was served hot and crispy from the oven, but there was no inspiration, no flavor. The sweet olive salad that accompanied it was the same, sweetened by something, but nothing more. The kitchen needs someone to light the spark, get them to THINK before they just drop the plate for pickup.The caprese salad was beautiful, but arrived with no pepper, no salt, and no olive oil. It was there on the table, but, really? I'm of the camp that the s/p shakers are there for decoration only; the kitchen is supposed to season my order correctly. If the kitchen isn't going to do it, at least offer freshly ground pepper at the table by the server. Is this a do-it-yourself menu?I ordered the grilled calamari salad because I'm tired of breaded-and-fried. Unfortunately the only taste I got from the salad were the flavors from the grill left over from other meat that was "recently" prepared there. I hope recently means just that day, no earlier. No dressing, no tossed-with-anything before plating, zip. Salad mix was straight from the Dole pre-mix bag.The main courses from the kitchen arrived all at once, but we were told the veggie pizza was still on its way. Seven minutes later it arrived, and being polite diners, the rest of us had waited. You guessed it, ours were cold. Lasagna was overcooked and mushy, uninteresting with the gobs of pizza sauce piled on it; I could have done better at the ready-wrap from Fresh and Easy. Cream sauce from the artichoke dish was so rich and thick, it could be called cheese; yuck. The artichokes themselves hadn't been peeled and the outer chewy leaf was still on! The veggie pizza's crust was the same bland bread we had just sampled, its veggies too thickly cut to cook properly, so they were partially raw with cool centers.We were offered a tiramisu as dessert and it was sumptuous.I hope that I get to update this review with a better result next time, but for now, what these cooks need is a good kick in the pants.GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!!Although I have eaten here twice and absolutely loved it, I have been afraid to write a review of it because I'm afraid people won't take it seriously. Because they shouldn't. I gave a four-star review to Pizza Patron. Because I for one love traditionally awful pizza. The sketchier the better. I like it greasy (like my hair) and cheap (like my thrills). I love it when the pepperoni gets those little pools of oil in them and when there's so much topping that it falls off the pie while you're cutting it and you have to pick it out of the box...you know, I think I'm going to stop here before I lose my Elite Status on principle.There's a reason you don't see me waiting in line for Pizzeria Bianco. Because I would just embarrass myself by asking the waitier if my Wise Guy could come with a side of ranch or brown sauce (you call it A-1, like that makes it classier...stfu).The first time Misty and I went to Pizza A Metro, we took my mother. After having just learned that all that underwear in the laundry was actually mine and not my girlfriends, she really needed the cheering up. So we decided to bring her into a sweaty pizzeria and tell her we were engaged.I say sweaty because at the time the air conditioner was broken. They did have some fans up. A whole lot of good a couple of fans did when we were sitting like five paces away from the fucking oven.We ordered a metro-size margherita pizza, which really hampered our yelping because we spent THREE DAYS eating the damn thing. But fuck was it delicious. Here I was trying to find the craziest, fattiest meats to stack onto my pizza and all it takes is some basil and tomatoes to sate my taste buds. The manager was really nice with a dash of eccentric charm. Which is good, because he spent our WHOLE meal standing over us, striking up small talk and asking us our opinions of the food. Yeah man, the food's great. Now if you'll excuse us, I need to call work and tell them I need to take the week off so I can digest your fucking franken-monstrosity of a pizza.Mom enjoyed it too, I think. With all this life-changing news happening around her, I think I could've said to her "I just saved money on my car insurance by switching to Geico" and her eyes would have filled with tears of relief and joy.The second time we went, we brought my brother, the pickiest, most pretentious eater I have ever known.  This is a guy who defends his refusal to try sushi by saying "there are some things I just know I won't like. Like [insert homoerotic sex maneuver]." Yes, I said maneuvers. No go [synonym for "copulate"] yourself.He actually lives down the street from a Pizza Patron and eats it 2x a week. And even HE admitted the pizza was amazing. He didn't care much for the carpaccio, but I did. And this is my review. So whatever.I personally like the intimate space, claustrophobia aside. I'm tired of these reasonably sized restaurants that cater to normal crowds of people. I want massive kitchens that leave little to no room for diners. The smaller the dining area, the higher the likelihood you get to sit by the window. Sit by the window and watch all those other fools, I dunno, do what fools do, like watch MTV and vote against gay rights, I guess. Yeah, phobe, I can see you trampling my rights. You have just been taken off the list for my next party, jerkface.I'm so confident in Pizza A Metro's potential for awesomeness that I'm even going to try something not pizza next time. Gasp. Am I going to violate my "no eating anything not stated in the sign" policy? Yes. This weekend (or January 18, if this ever gets to be ROTD), when I meet with some other yelper(s) for lunch, I will probably order a pasta dish. And maybe a salad. Oh god am I about go through my  "salads only" phase? I am NOT looking forward to this.pizza a metro is decidely good. I don't think there is any disputing that. You'd have to be a stone cold douche to disagree. I would be so bold as to say that their pizza is amongst the top 10 in the valley. I'm not sure of its rank but it'd definitely be up there in my list.I dropped in last night after class with a rumbling belly and craving some good pizza, I'd read some of it's reviews a while back, and realized it was on thomas, essentially down the street from PC. Pizza A Metro is the definition of a hole in the wall, easily missed by thoughtless drivers and the uninitiated. Thanks to Yelp and word of mouth it wasnt too epic of a quest to find, however I did lose an elderly bearded companion of mine as we battled a giant demon with a flaming whip and the bridge we were standing on collapsed- after that, it wasnt too difficult to get to.I stepped inside, and immediatly I was struck by how charmingly quaint the interior was. Quaint in this circumstance is a euphemism for small, but since when did bigger mean better? (ladies this is not in reference to me, best believe!)Although a little cramped it is very welcoming and warm inside, you instantly feel at home.I stood awkardly next to a full table of women on a "girls night out" until the owner urged me to wait at a table, he grabbed me some water and then waltzed off to chat with the other patrons. The entire time I was waiting he was chatting with the various tables and assumedly ensuring that everything was to their liking.When my pizza was done, I paid at the counter and was impressed with the pricetag: $9 and some change for a rather large "small" Margherita Pizza. The pizza was phenomenal, and the price tag was appreciated as I just bought an $87 text book.I will def. be back soon.Wow! Another lesson of not judging a book by its cover.  This place is very small, only 2- 4 tops & about 3 - 2 tops. We stopped in around 5pm & there was another couple in there, they could tell it was our first time so they were raving about all their favorite items.  Our server came by & started us out with water & some bread.  Their prices were really affordable, the server explained that the smallest size of pizza can actually feed 2 people ($8!) we decided to split a Margherita pizza so we could save room for their Tiramisu.  Our server & the couple dining in told us that everything is made from scratch.  Our pizza came out & it was fabulous! So flavorful & had the perfect amount of crunch & doughy goodness in each bite.  Tiramisu was so fresh & delicious.  Our total came out to $15! We can't wait to come back & try some of their pasta dishes soon. Thank you fellow Yelpers for leading us here!!There's a bit of history with me and this place. Many moons ago, my family was super close to the former owners of this place when it was called Romans pizza. Then my brother and his best friend bought it from them and ran it...to the ground. And that's probably the best thing that ever happened to this place because luckily after that, Pizza A Metro happened. I always passed by this place but I never bothered to stop because the area really creeps me out. Well, after seeing a bunch of my yelp friends check in to here and reading the reviews, I finally decided it was time. This place is a poster child for "don't judge a book by it's cover" because that's what I did and I missed out. When I walked in, it's tiny. But it gives you a warm feeling. I don't know what it is about it. I got the to-go menu and they had their lunch menu which was incredibly cheap! I ordered the small margherita pizza. I asked the girl how small is the small and she told me 12 inches...here I am thinking 8 inches. And it was only $7.95! What a deal! I was stuck between the tirimisu and the creme brûlée. I love both desserts and I love homemade tirimisu even more but the creme brûlée won. I had my dessert before my pizza since I had to wait til it was cooked. The creme brûlée was excellent! It was perfectly creamy and the perfect amount of vanilla flavor.My pizza was ready and I took it with me...I don't usually like to eat in my car but I DEVOURED this pizza before I even made it to school. It wasn't overly salty, had the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. I wish it had more basil but it didn't ruin it. Overall, I was satisfied! I will definitely be back to try the pastas and the tirimisu!

Restaurant name  Ice Tango

Review Text :
I'm with Kelly W -My favorite Ice Tango combo is twangy tart with pomegranate and mochi, but the rest of their fresh fruit and other toppings are always tempting as well. I was really sad when the original Ice Tango location closed a few months back, but luckily, I'm not too far from this Hilton Village location.  We decided stop in for our Ice Tango fix last night with our family friends.  I called ahead to make sure they were open (it was Easter Sunday) and sure enough, they were!  Everyone ordered their favorite combinations and we were one happy bunch.Ready for the even more exciting news?  We learned that their Old Town location will be opening really soon!  And the new location will be self-serve if I understand correctly... exciting, yes - dangerous too... especially when I'm really trying to stay on the wedding diet!

Restaurant name  Bombay Spice Grill

Review Text :
The second location of Bombay Spice is now open!  It's conveniently located on the north west corner of Tatum and Shea in the Whole Foods/Soma Cafe shopping center.I went with a group of 7 on Tuesday night for dinner and 6 out of 7 of us loved it... sorry again, Marc - I felt awful that we all enjoyed and you did not.  Let me explain:Since I'd been to the 16th street location before, i suggested Bombay Spice to mix things up a bit.  The group I was with are pretty healthy health conscious so I thought they may enjoy Indian food done healthy...We shared the chickpea ceviche as an appetizer and then most of us ordered the different rice bowls as entrees.  We had fun with the variety of sauces too.  Favorite choices included the cauliflower, eggplant, chicken tikka masala, and veggie tofu tikka as well as the mint, hot, and curry sauces.  Unfortunately, Marc is allergic to onions and everything he attempted to order had onions in it.  By the time he placed an order for plain chicken and rice, we were all almost done and the kitchen was slammed and didn't prioritize his order (as they should have).  So, Marc didn't eat.  :(I will return for sure for the food - it's prepared for the health conscious eater and it is not as heavy as traditional Indian Food - I happen to like that!  NOTE: if you are allergic or really hate onions, be careful about ordering so you don't starve like my friend Marc did!I don't consider Bombay Spice an authentic Indian Restaurant; more of a modern and healthier version of the Indian cuisine. I appreciate their healthy take and their vast vegan and gluten free options.I have been to Bombay about five or six times over the course of the last year, and have eaten some of their items at Yelp events. I have never disliked any of the items I have tried, but there have certainly been a few items I found less than flavorful (vegetable lentil soup, cauliflower, spicy veggie curry).Last week I tried the seared tofu, and it was absolutely amazing. It is an appetizer, but comes with five or six good sized slices of tofu, and I would eat it as a meal. I also fell in love with the DELICIOUS tofu masala. I couldn't be happier with either of those selections and highly recommend them. I also like that you get to choose two menu items and have it served in a variety of ways (plated with rice, lettuce wraps, roti taco, etc). It gives a little extra variety depending on your mood. One complaint I have is that they do not know which wines are vegan. To have a separate menu focusing on vegan entrees and to not know what complimentary drinks are also vegan leaves me a little dissatisfied.Overall, Bombay has good service, a good location next to Whole Foods, progressive menu items, is moderately priced, and has a good variety of items available for vegans and carnivores alike.

Review Text :
Fans of the dramatic misfortunate adventures of RyanC read on...WikiWiki, whose name creates instant old school rap flashbacks*, catered the recent Tiki Party PBR Concert featuring Fishbone and other cool local acts.The grilled meat smelled good (although when does grilled meat not) so I stepped up to their little table setup and surveyed a grill full of what looked like flattened chicken thighs and their menu sign which offered a limited selection from their regular menu: $5 Chicken $7 Beef Short Ribsor $7 Meat Combo-all with white rice and macaroni salad.I ordered the combo.  A few moments later I opened up the styrofoam clamshell the Young Male (YM) staffer handed me.  I'd gotten all rice,and there were in fact two small icecream scooper mounds of glutenous grain, but slapped on top of it was one small piece of chicken, perhaps one very small or half a large deboned thigh, and one small strip of short rib, which had less meat than a steroid-addict musclebound lunkhead's got in his roomy banana hammock.I extended my hand holding the food back towards him and said "that's all I get?"Making no gesture towards grabbing the tray at all, he replies matter-of-factly, "that 's how much you get."After spending a few moments politely describing the larger portions I've seen everyone else sporting and asking for either more food or a discount, YM refuses.Another patron has arrived and is loose on PBR, so is standing way too close for my personal space comfort, but this means he's heard me and YM talking.  Let's call him Drunken Dirtbag (DDB).  Now, DDB is amused by all of this, but he's also hungry, so he asks YM to rustle him up a Chicken Plate with Mac and rice.  YM doesn't even hesitate, but instantly offers DDB my plate of food, saying "You want to buy this? He doesn't want it anymore so you can just pay him"I've been holding this food in my personal possession for over 5 minutes now, and although i never spit on it or anything, YM doesn't know that!  Is this even something allowed by health laws?DDB chuckles heartily but declines, saying he just wants the $5 chicken plate.  "Me too....now", I contribute.I explain to YM that I will just have to alleviate my feelings of being ripped off by causing him to lose some significant business.  I won't lie or make anything up, I'll just show anyone who steps up to order exactly how much food they can expect for their money, and then they can decide if it's worth it, instead of having to be surprised and disappointed like me.YM: "Go ahead."    Game on, this should be fun.  `,8^ )Actually, it wasn't even working out that well, since more than half of those I showed still wanted to order, but I did get some sympathizers who joined my protest.My friends were also supportive, letting me be, and checking back in on me after several minutes.  I was getting a little tired of holding onto my principals by this point, when OF, sorry that's the Older Female staffer from WikiWiki, came over with 7 single$ fanned out like a hand of cards, excitedly letting me know, "Okay, here.  You can go now.  Seven dollars. Here."  This was not her coming rushing in to save the situation, no, no.  This was a good 15 minutes after my initial order now.  This was her resigning herself to the fact that I wasn't going to go away, and the night was still young.I smiled at her, turned around and set my tray on the table, giving YM a snarkily satisfied smirk, and went back to the festivities, proud and bully-ish feeling at the same time.As far as the restaurant istelf, well, it is run by these grumpy stubborn, non-customer-service oriented folks, apparently so I'm never setting foot in the place, nor ever eating their overpriced, underwhelming food ever again.*yes, my friend Eric and I really did break dance to that song in 5th and 6th grade.Jam on it...Jam on it...Jam, Ja-J-J-J-J-Jam on it!

Restaurant name  The Dhaba
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Now with so many good things going for it, I did leave The Dhaba slightly indifferent. You see when I order and eat, I'm pretty much a total top. While I am open to suggestion, I have a good idea of what I want and how I want it. During my visit, not only was I flipped but I didn't have much say in the matter. Please don't get me wrong, our server was friendly however, every time when one of us ordered something, he would tell us that he would order something better for us to enjoy. For me, I was dead set on ordering several wraps and rolls called Sada Bahar, what I ended up with was far from what I originally envisioned. While I did get my way with a few appetizers, I have to say not only was I pleased with his domineering ordering selections, but would eagerly let him order again for me.Street food called chaat, is to Indian cooking as dim sum is to Chinese. Usually a small plate with around 3 servings varying in preparation, and with enough variety to make a meal out of. Starting with the Amritsri Samosa Chaat ($6); these are a deep fried triangular dumpling filled with a mixture of potatoes, onions and chili, served with a spicy yogurt sauce. Perfectly crunchy and not a drop of oil, just breaking into one of them was a delight as the fragerent steam escaped, it was aromatherapy Indian style.Ambala Tiki Chaat ($6) was more of a composed small plate. A couple of potato pancakes, layered with garbanzo beans, onions, and garnished with fresh mint & tamarind chutney and yogurt. The flavor components with Indian cooking are generally very complex, this plate was a great example of complexity and harmony. Each bite had varying degrees of spicy and sweet then a slightly sour finish from the chutney.Complexity doesn't quite work like with the Kolkata Pani Puri ($6). These are round hollows, fried crisp and served with a watery mixture of tamarind, chili and potatoes. The idea is to spoon in some of the mixture into each puri, then pop into your mouth. While the texture was nice, the flavors just never came together and ended up just tasting weird.This is the part where he took over and assured us what he was ordering was going to be quite good. As the dishes came out we weren't quite sure what was what, so we just dug in. Eventually we got clarity and just continued to share, family style.Arriving on a sizzling iron skillet covered with peppers and onions, the Chicken Tikka Kabob ($11) was not only a dramatic presentation coming from the kitchen, but the colors were vivid and bright. Large pieces of boneless/skinless chicken breast are rubbed with spices then grilled, resulting in a beautiful yellow color. The chicken was tender and moist yet had a slight smokiness that added another welcome dimension.Served in a large basket were piles of hot freshly baked naan ($3 per order). The thick and tender bread was a welcome site since I was wanting a wrap to begin with. Plain, garlic and chili each flavor welcomes dipping, wrapping and scooping of sauces and meats.Loving yogurt, the creamy tang of the Kashmiri Chicken Tikka Masala ($10) was a welcome surprise. This is where the naan really came into play by making good use of the tender pieces of chicken and yogurt sauce. Sopping up as much of the delicious sauce as I could, interactivity is just part of the experience.With so many different spices and spiciness, the Mango Lassi ($3) was as welcome as the rain. Yogurt and water mixed with sugar and mango was cooling and refreshing. With the addition of a fruit puree on the inside of the glass, made this version different than others Ive tried, though the effect was still the same.At the end of the meal we were brought out a bowl of rice pudding with a scoop of pistachio ice cream. While the sliced dates and papaya were pretty to look at, none of the flavors made much sense together. Complaining aside, this did arrive complimentary. Who knows, maybe for being a good sports?We were also brought out another off menu item, it was a thick, flaky and buttery paratha. Similar to a flour tortilla, this particular version was filled with pureed cherry and sprinkled with anise seeds. After only one taste we were hooked. The group of us made short order of the warm tender layers. You might have to ask for this one to be made special. Our server actually told us how soldiers in the hills of Afghanistan, would make these since it didn't take to many ingredients or tools. He stared blankly out the window as he told the story, perhaps of his own personal experience building make shift clay ovens?Alright, so sometimes letting go can be a hard thing to do. After this experience, its actually kind of nice sitting back and enjoying the surprises the kitchen has in store.pretty scrumptious.we had so much food it was nuts. my friend had a restaurants.com coupon so we went to town. we ordered the takki nakki (jk i dont remember the name) it was potato pancake with onions and other amazing things. it was so insanely good...you must get it. it's one of the most recommended things in the yelp reviews and it's a starter so look for it. then we ordered the chicken fritters. they were basically like indian style chicken nuggets. curry and mango served with a garbanzo bean dipping sauce. pretty good.then we ordered the full experience meal. it came with chicken tandoori, indian style fried rice (amazing), chicken or lamb curry, a salad, a dessert (we got one of both and the rice pudding was the way to go) and chai tea.i loved the little crispy thing they served before our meals with sauces. so amazing. we also ordered garlic naan which was amazing. the service was weird. there's a girl who fills up your water but she doesn't answer any questions. you have to wait for the hostess/waitress. she was super sweet but it was slow. once you order, the food comes quickly and there is just so much food. if you like bland food, don't come here you boring white person! jk. kinda. be advernturousI always enjoy a sqaure deal, and today was no exception. Having a shiny new restaurant*com coupon in hand, we made our way out for The Dhaba. I'm not too proud to partake in a coupon here and there. Let's face it, why pay $40 when you can spend $25 after tax and generous tip? Now that's smart shopping.This place was a good decision. We really enjoyed the food, they're in a nice spot right off the light rail, they've got a cool Indian (dot - not feather) market and adjacent shops to check out before, or after, your meal. The Adrak De Panje dish (marinated lamb cooked in the tandoor for those of you who don't know); while tasty, was a bit tougher than I was expecting. They could stand to provide a sharper knife with this item. I was here with my wife and mother-in-law and we all really enjoyed the Nawabi Murg Tikke (marinated chicken cooked in the tandoor).Overall they serve great tasting food and India themed décor. The restaurant dining area echoed on the inside, which made for an interesting experience. We could literally hear what our neighbors were talking about. While they did have music it could have been a bit louder, felt like we could hear every conversation from all the surrounding tables. and I expect that this could have been overcome with ambiance level music or some interior curtains.At one of the shops, we met an interesting and awesome guy behind the counter, my guess is that he's the owner. He told us about different spices and dietary info about different Indian foods. Had a fun evening learning about Indian foods!Happy Yelping Phoenix! .... errr Tempe I guess. ;-)The whole dining experience from the time we walked in to the time we waddled out was FCUing amazing.Sometimes everything works out just right and this was one of those times.The menu is complex and is probably a little daunting if you have not eaten in an Indian restaurant before. If this is your first trip to an Indian restaurant have the waiter or waitress suggest a few dishes for you.We ordered an almost all-meat appetizer that included chicken, shrimp and some peppers and onions. It was a perfect start to a great meal. We paired this with a lovely bottle of Pinot noir that was really smooth and light.We followed this with a mango chicken, goat curry, a spinach dish, garlic naan, basmati rice and raita.The three main dishes complemented each other perfectly. We only ordered the curry at a level six hotness and we could probably have gone to an eight.The owner came out and asked us how everything was and we had a very pleasant chat with him.We were the last people left in the restaurant as it was after 9 pm when we were finishing out chai tea and complimentary rice pudding and doughnuts. One of the best Indian meals I have eaten and definitely a place I will return to.Man.  5/5 stars on yelp stands for "Woohoo! As good as it gets!", and that's exactly how I'll describe my experience at The Dhaba.  Every item we ate was flavorful and unique, the service was spectacular, and the setting, with ornate decorations and cool water goblets, definitely qualifies as a perfect selection for a date or anniversary.  We had the chance to chat with the owner and his family - they're huge on service to the community, and they take care of the nearby metro stop (I believe they even donated the land to build it).  Food-wise, everything was delicious, but I especially recommend the mango chicken curry dish.  Seriously, though, just ask for recommendations and they'll guide you right.Definitely will be back.  This one is going on my "best of Phoenix" list.

Restaurant name  Restaurant Les Princesses
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I believe that context is really the deciding factor in experiencing a place like Princesses. Located about 15 minutes outside of the downtown core of Montreal, near Olympic stadium, Princesses is a greasy spoon style diner that has one unique specialty; two words that are all it takes for my interest to be piqued: "Topless Breakfast". Seems hilarious, right?It's an interesting juxtaposition to say the least. We went just after noon on a Sunday, hungry for our first meal of the day and we were greeted by 3 Waitresses that were, as advertised, topless. There was also one fully dressed man who had a commanding presence and quite the leer about him. I suppose his stink eye is to keep potential trouble makers in check, but still, it's hard to enjoy your eggs and get an eyefull of the scenery when you're getting an eyefull of your own from someone else.This is where context comes into play - It was a lot of nudity for that early in the morning. I was hungry and totally sober, so it was pretty strange. Add to that, the fact that it was the capper to a 3 day weekend celebrating my friend Daniel's last days of Bachlordom. If we had gone to Princesses first thing, I'm sure we could have sat their giggling and pointing like school children when their teacher tells them about puberty, but that late into the weekend, so much had already been seen and done and been done to us, We had sort of been desensitized to it. It was more or less business as usual at our breakfast table. Giddy giggling and knowning glances were replaced with aloof requests for more ketchup. It's sort of like if you had been wearing X-Ray Spex all weekend, after a while you'd just order your coffee refill and not even bat an eye at someones junk as they give it to you.The food itself was passable diner fare. As tasty as they looked, I opted out of the traditional breakfast, and had a burger, which was good, but nothing exceptional. Service was decent, the waitresses were friendly and Coffee was refilled semi-regularly. Also, to Princesses credit, I was impressed that one of our waitresses was still working there despite being visibly pregnant (if, by some chance, she's reading this, and by another chance and isn't actually pregnant - then I am really, really, totally fucking sorry). I don't imagine that would happen at many other establishments where toplessness was a requirement.Overall Princesses was a one of a kind experience. A better name for it might be "Emperor's new diner" (or maybe just "The Emperor's") because nobody seemed to even acknowledge the toplessness. It reminded me of the Toronto-Produced "Naked News" that made a splash on the internet a few years ago. Theres nudity, but once you're there it's not at all the focus. So, if it's the morning and you've got a rumble in your tummy and a hankering for some present albeit understated nudity, this is your spot.

Restaurant name  Over Easy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
4 stars for the food and prices.  All of their food looks good and some stuff is pretty unique.  I had their homemade corned beef hash with some eggs and rye toast that never came.  My wife had the Pollo Loco omelet which was good as well.  Good stuff and reasonable prices.However, if you enjoy the following, Over Easy is probably the place for you.* a crappy parking situation* a 20 minute wait (which isn't that bad if the place is worth it)* being so crammed in that you are basically sitting on top of the people next to you* being ridiculously hot because they couldn't spring for more/better fans or an outdoor A/C thing (my fault for going in September but tons of people were standing in line to be crammed and hot so I thought I could stick it out)* bad service (god forbid they ask you if everything is ok, if you need anything else, or want a refill on anything but water)Oh and if my server is reading this, I am still waiting on my toast you said, "would be right out".I agree with Laura E, Over Easy is now just Meh!!! What's happened to Over Easy?  HELLO Mr Owners of OE, your service and food have changed since your move and it's not a good change...  We've watched the decline of this little "hole in da wall" breakfast joint that used to be one of the best places to go in the mornings ~ Pre Food Network and Triple D....I can see where your trying to accommodate more people in your new place but COME ON, I was elbowed twice while eating next to strangers beside us!  This is not a comfortable environment for dinning unless you want to get cozy and share your food with strangers...The service was very disappointing, blunderous, and left us wanting.  Our drinks were not maintained and when we had issue concerning our meal our server told us it would be a while before we could get another order of pancakes, without an apology. We had the chicken and waffles, which were ok ~ the chicken was nice and crisp but was a little over done. The waffle was flat and plain. We also had pancakes with sides of bacon and sausage. The pancakes were cold for some reason so we wanted to order some fresh but our server was not helpful. The bacon was very good as was the sausage.  We also had the Wolfpack, which was very good with two eggs, bacon and cheese between layers of crisp buttery hashbrownie goodness. Very filling but not something to order if your watching your carb in take. I hope you listen to the Yelpers and make some changes soon.  There are too many other places to dine for breakfast and lunch that are as good if not better than you now.  After all the Food Network foodies have tried your place for the first and last time ~ The Yelpers (regulars) want the old Over Easy service and quality of food back please.The food was good, the vibe was also good. ** Except there was a very unfriendly older lady taking my order. She seemed a bit annoyed and was just not pleasant nor warm.*** However, I will give it a second try at their Frank Lloyd Wright Location soon!!!. Hopefully they'll be a bit more friendly there!!! I've heard wonderful things about this restaurant from co-workers, so I wouldn't want to give up just because I had a not-so delightful first impression.  :)Can someone please tell me why people go here???Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed, probably because it's a holiday week.That doesn't excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldn't take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes.Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didn't seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now aren't even good enough to brag about.I'm sure if the service had been better, I wouldn't be so miserable right now. My food coma isn't satisfying. I will *never* go here again. Ever. I felt stupid leaving a tip, it was THAT bad. Total. Fail. Blech.Tried to Visit this establishment. Was a 5 to ten minute wait. No problem. Grabbed a iced coffee, it is 100 degrees outside. Grabbed a paper - sitting outside waiting. First impression. Greater tells me to drink up or throw away the iced coffee. Seriously. I bought this to survive waiting on your Resturant. The server says owner policy. It's two sips off a iced coffee, but what a crazy rule. So I ask to speak to the owner, literally seated yards away - "he's in a meeting", so they go get the manager. Still have not stepped foot in the Resturant. Still outside. Lovely Arizona hospitality!!! No manager arrives. Eventually I give up. Go down to the right and visit The Black Cat Coffee house. What a difference. I have my food in front of me, the staff are great. I got in first try. Avoid the over easy. Stick to black catWORST EXPERIENCE EVER!Let me get this straight, I LOVE the Gilbert location. The Phoenix experience was hands down the worst of my life. I never made it into the restaurant to eat because the hostess was SO rude. I actually told her "I feel like I am inconveniencing you - should I take my business elsewhere?" she replied "look around, it is packed, we don't need your business". I explained that I brought a group of friends (6 total) to the restaurant because I love the Gilbert place so much - the food is great and service spectacular. She told me that "everyone complains about the Gilbert location and says they are snotty, so you much be lying". We went to the Vig instead.I called the Gilbert location to inform them an employee was bad mouthing them. I left my number as well but never heard back.

Restaurant name  Golden China
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Chinese restaurants are to Avondale what pizza joints are to Peoria; they come included with every strip mall, equipped with generic menus, Pepsi fountains and a seemingly randomly assigned embarrassingly stereotypical name. Golden China is on the opposite corner of 107th & Indian School as Dragon Garden Express and a block west of Wong's. This explains why I never tried it all these years. I just saw it at superfluous.It's like putting Ballpark pizza right by Pullano--oh wait.I usually don't get takeout at night because at Wong's and DGE their dinner entrees come with steamed rice and I can't hang with steamed rice. It's like fried rice without the personality, or Ann Coulter without her Adam's apple.But dammit I needed some sweet and sour pork or kung pao two. There was no negotiating with my appetite. It was Chinese or the other thing I'm always in the mood for: ramen. And I've been trying to cut down on that. At the rate I'm putting all these preservatives in my body, I will live to be 200. And Law and Order will still be on television.So I decided to take a chance on Golden China in hopes they could spare me from the wrath of the steamed rice god.Being too distracted by the superbly cliche interior decorating, I failed to notice the menu posted on the window. So once I got to the counter, I was only able to browse for a few seconds before just randomly selecting whatever sounded good.I ordered the twice cooked pork. While I sat in one of their two-small-for-me-but-what isn't? chairs, one of their staff brought it out to me and handed me a plastic bag that felt a little heavier than normal. When I got home, I found that my standard styrofoam tv takeout tray had come with two small paper bags. One contained the fortune cookies and some hot oil.The other came with a cheese wonton, an eggroll, and a crab puff.While I was delighted to see all the treats my dinner came with, it left me perplexed.If the eggroll is right here, then what's in the third compartment of the takeout tray? Oh please don't be two compartments of fried rice.Be still my beating heart.My dinner came with fried rice AND NOODLES.An entree with noodles? Are you sure you aren't Panda Express?As expected, the pork was amazing. And spicy. Glass of milk spicy. The noodles were soft and slimy, the crab puff was crabtastic, the eggroll was savory and crunchy, not even the bland and unimaginative fried rice could ruin this meal. Looking back, I realize that I am really bad at describing flavors. How did I get to be Elite again?I was so full I thought I would rupture my stomach but I still wanted more.So I went again for lunch the next day.I got the sweet and sour pork. It was hot and juicy, with chunks of pineapple mixed in with the vegetables and tender meat. While not nearly as filling as the dinner experience, it served to stave off my endless hunger for cheap Chinese for a few hours.The takeout is just as good and filling as Wong's dine-in. I can't attest to GC's dining-in experience yet, because every time I've gone there I was the only one in the restaurant, and I have a rule about being at the only occupied table in a restaurant. That happened to me on a date once. It's hard to maintain interesting "getting to know you" conversation while some waiter lurks over you practically begging you with their eyes to give them something to do. Moral of the story: If the zombie apocalypse occurs and it turns out that brains taste like orange chicken, just leave me behind.

Review Text :
When Viet Thai first opened many moons ago, we went barreling in  one evening and what I remember was it being newly painted, sparse and no alcohol license yet.  So a group of eight, turned around to leave, my mom tells the man, "we come back when you have alcohol."  I thought good lord, let me get this woman out of here!I decided to give it a try yesterday, it looked totally different from my first visit. The two people were working were pleasant and efficient.  I ordered fresh rolls and vermicelli with pork.  There is something very addictive in Vietnamese food, maybe it's the cilantro and mint or the fish sauce, but you can bet, I want to eat there again today.And yes, mama, they do have alcohol, it's safe to return.Viet-Thai... Oh Viet-Thai. First of all, let me explain my 4 Stars. Viet-Thai is a 5-star joint when you compare it to all other Asian restaurants in Charlotte. However, when you compare Viet-Thai to restaurants in other cities (Honolulu, LA, Atlanta/Duluth, etc.), it may fall a little short. LOCATIONSouth Charlotte-ishAMBIENCEComfortable, family-style restaurant. Comfy booths, tables.. I've never felt uncomfortable wearing shorts and a t-shirt here. If you're looking for an upscale meal for an uppity date, this is definitely not the place for you. if you've been dating a girl/guy for 2+ years and you're comfortable eating a ton of good food and maybe leaving a little pudgier than when you first walked in, this is the place for you! The waitresses are more than accommodating. If you go there often enough (like I do), mama-san starts to recognize you and brings you extra food items even before you ask (such as pho soup on the side or extra peanut sauce). Despite the non-uppity nature of this restaurant, be forewarned that the prices are a bit steep.FOODI like Asian food. I think that Charlotte is really lacking in this arena. SERIOUSLY LACKING. I also think that Charlotte folks don't really know Asian food.. but that's really besides the point. (but seriously, come on. Cowfish is not a great restaurant. why do you guys keep going there for sushi???) Anyway, what is important is that I am a return customer at Viet-Thai. That says a lot for this little place in Charlotte. Viet-Thai is a funky, fusion-ish restaurant. My theory is that the owners are a husband-wife combo who decided to merge their ethnic backgrounds to create this restaurant. (Let me be clear peeps... Restaurants that have "multi-Asian" cuisine should be thought of as wonky.)Viet-Thai is the place we go to when we need our pho or pad thai fix for the week. It's pretty darn convenient that I can order both pho and pad thai at once. Again, come here with someone you're comfortable chowing down with. Summer Rolls (not fried)Their *huge* summer rolls are delicious but definitely not what you'd expect from a Vietnamese joint. They use a little bit of cabbage and some other greens that typically don't get rolled into the summer roll. Their peanut sauce is also a little different than other places. It's pretty runny and heavy on the peanut butter rather than hoisin. PhoTheir pho has always been on point. It isn't greasy and definitely doesn't lack in flavor. Their broth has a significant amount of cilantro flavoring though-- so for those of you who don't appreciate herbal deliciousness, you may want to stay away from pho. Mi Mi... I was recently introduced to this dish by my Vietnamese friend, Tommy in an authentic Vietnamese restaurant on Buford Highway. You know that's legit.The mi is pretty delicious. The broth is definitely lighter (in taste and in color) than pho and the seafood flavor is pretty amazing. It has a sweet after taste that's really pleasing.......... But, it's salty. Seriously salty. Pad Thai Their pad thai is great... most of the time. I think that the cook changes depending on the day of the week. On Sundays, the pad thai is ALWAYS ON POINT. Just a little piece of advice. :) The chicken is always tender and there is always tofu in the pad thai no matter what protein you order it with. Note: this is the extreme tamarind type of pad thai. BunBun here is wonderful. I've had shrimp, chicken, pork, beef.. all of the above, you know. Bun at viet-thai is a semi-cold noodle dish that is typically served with greens and a hefty serving of protein. The fish sauce is on point and you really can't go wrong with ordering this dish. If you're in the mood for something a little lighter but still slightly warm and delicious, this is the dish for you.

Un grand classique du quartier. La nourriture goûte souvent comme à la casa di nonna le dimanche après-midi. Je dis souvent, parce que des fois le goût n'y est pas, il manque de quelque chose. Le midi par exemple c'est moins bon, plus gras que d'habitude. Mais c'est quand même meilleur que ben d'autres resto italien. On y va dans un esprit de partage, les portions sont généreuses, tellement abordables et il faut gouter à plusieurs plats. La pizza à la roquette et la salade maison peuplent mes rêves parfois, c'est comme un bec en pincette de grand-maman italienne, doux, réconfortant pis un peu piquant!

Stopped by for lunch with a fellow Yelper the other day.  Heard this was an organic healthy, Vegan & Vegetarian hangout.....that also served the Carnivores, so I was eager to give it a try and see what it feels like to be a Vegan in a Steakhouse (since I'm a Carnivore).  This was one of the most difficult reviews for me to write.  This place has so much potential.....I wish there was a 1/2 Star system because I want to give it 3.5 Stars and was on the fence for 3 or 4 Stars, here's why:The menu is pretty extensive and has a lot of items that pique'd my interest, such as: Grilled Chicken Soft Tacos ($12.95), Buffalo Chicken Wrap ($7.99), Pepperoni Pizzetta ($8.95)....wait, what's a Pizzetta?  Turns out it's a Pizza.....come on, enough with the goofy names already, just call it a Pizza and call it a day!  A lot of stuff looked good and I was surprised at the number of items available for Carnivores....I ended up ordering their Fire Fries (Baked Fries topped with Hot Sauce, Pico de Gallo, Mozzarella & Cheddar Cheese $7) and a Chicken Panini (w/Buffalo Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil with Pesto $7.95).  The server asked if I wanted the Vegan Cheese on the Fire Fries....I passed and wanted the full monty.To wash it down, I had some Iced Tea ($2.50)....which was awesome BTW.The service was a bit slow.  It took some time for the waiter to take our order and the table next to us had to stop a busperson to get their order taken too.  It was 11:30 am and the lunch rush hadn't started yet, so I don't know what the issue was.  Anyway, it wasn't too bad but was borderline annoying.....another few minutes and it would have cost them a Star.Our food came out after a short wait and I was surprised to see how HUGE the Fire Fries were!  I thought this was suppose to be a "healthy" restaurant?!  LOL  For a minute I thought I was in Claim Jumper!  The Fries look too good, so I attacked them first.  The top layer of Fire Fries were awesome....baked well and had good flavor.  However.....the middle and bottom portion of the Fries were undercooked and semi-raw, not good.  Also, the cook didn't spread the ingredients throughout the dish.....the Hot Sauce and Pico de Gallo was only in one corner of the dish, buried under the top layer of Cheese.  The other 3/4 of the dish was only melted Cheese and the Fries.  This was a damn shame because the portion with all of the ingredients was awesome!  The rest of it was just so/so.  He/she needs a lesson in making a consistent dish.The Chicken Panini was next.....after I took one bite I realized I made a big mistake.  The combination of Fire Fries and the Chicken Panini wasn't good.  The sharp, spicy flavor of the Fire Fries overwhelmed my taste buds so when I ate my Chicken Panini it tasted bland.  This is not the restaurant's fault, but mine.  So my review of the Panini is incomplete.  The side Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette was awesome though.  Another note....the Panini came with Whole Grain Bread as a default....I wasn't given an option for any other type of Bread, but saw other people with Panini's with what appeared to be White Bread....wish I had the choice.Overall, this place has a lot of potential.  That's what made it so difficult for me to rate it....the 1/4 of the Fries that had all of the ingredients and were cooked thoroughly tasted awesome but the raw Potatoes in the middle was a turn off.  For now they get 4 Stars for their Vegan/Vegetarian menu options and the potential of their Fire Fries.Will I return?  I will someday to try a couple more items that intrigued me.My 5-star decision was solely made due to the decadence of the RED VELVET CUPCAKE!!! This is as good as it gets!! I have officially bumped all the cupcake spots down one on my list, haha!WHEN: I have no clue when they open, but I will be sure to ask and update the next time I am there.  The last time I went was on a weekend, and they close doors at 9pm, but they close the kitchen at 8pm, so get there sooner before they close on you!! After 8pm, you can try the desserts that they do have left.WHERE: Located on West Sahara & Buffalo!WHAT: As their menu states, "deliciously healthy"!!! I would come here every single day if it was a little bit closer to me, wahh!! I've noticed that people are discouraged to test this place out as soon as they hear the word VEGAN.  Honestly, I was a bit uneasy myself when I heard they served vegan food, but since I love trying new things, I walked in with an open-heart, open-mind, and an OPEN-TUMMY!FOOD:-mac&cheese: I had to have a spoonful of my mac!! You can never go wrong with mac&cheese, but it was just an okay dish here.  I don't think I'll be ordering it anytime soon.-fire fries: Everyone has their own crazy french fry dish!! This was actually pretty unique!! The fries are baked in pico de gallo and cheese... and when they brought it out and I took my first bite, it was for sure FIRE!-grilled chicken avocado panini: When I took my first bite, I experienced the deliciously healthy part!! It was something different, but it was Yummyyyy!!DESSERT: The only dessert worth tasting and the only one that I have ever tasted was the Vegan Red Velvet Cupcake!! It is gluten-free, no butter, no dairy, no egg (NO ANIMAL PRODUCT AT ALL) & is mouth-watering! I did not know how scrumptious one cupcake could be... UNTIL THIS ONE CAME INTO MY LIFE! The only this I have left to say is.. TRY THE RED VELVET CAKE!! While you're at it, order one for me and send it over! =DWe went here on a Friday night and it was packed!  You might even want to order your desserts ahead of time because it was slim pickings by the time we finished dinner at 7:30pm.  I got a panini with vegetarian turkey, chicken, onion, chipotle sauce and cheese on nine grain bread which was a special for January and it was tremendous.  I'll probably be back before the month is out just to have it again!  The vegetarian taco salad was incredible as well and would make a monstrous yet healthy entree.  I liked how the taco shell wasn't a deep fried tortilla but a baked kinda pita style bowl.  So much awesomeness.  I'm so ready to go back just thinking about it now.  The service was attentive and friendly.  They accidentally switched our sandwich orders and sides but made it right and gave us one free dessert to make up for the mistake.  It wasn't even a big deal.  Talk about above and beyond!  Wow!I was excited to check this place off my list after hearing all the good verbal reviews from friends & colleagues. I wanted to treat my broker to lunch and this was a convenient meeting spot close to our office. Very cute modern decor and a very tempting dessert display when you walk in. Regular seating was full so we sat at one of the high tables.Very extensive menu so will have something for everyone...good when you're not sure how finicky your lunch buddies are. I browsed the menu looking through salads, sandwiches, paninis specials and desserts. I ordered the caprese panini which came on a very hearty 9 grain bread that was satisfying and was served with baked Lays chips (I was also given a salad option)  Basil, tomato & mozzarella nothing special. My broker ordered the avocado & shrimp salad. She said the shrimp was done perfect. Overall I thought our food was ok and this review reflects one meal. For a salad and caprese panini with waters, including tip, bill was $31. Not that good a value in my opinion for an "ok" lunch. But we will be back to give other menu items a try and also indulge in one of their desserts next time. I hear the Vegan chocolate chip cookies are amazing.My friends always try to hype up this place to me, and I'm putting a stop to that now. I finally visited this place yesterday and was sadly disappointed.Being the hip vegan/vegatarian cafe that it was, it was pricey but the food was mediocre. In fact, it's the same shit you can go a couple blocks over and buy at Whole Foods. Me and my friend ordered two different things. She got chicken burger with fries, and I got a panini sandwich witth tomato, we both opted for the vegan options. When we got our order, which took forever, we were brought pretty much the exact same thing, except different bread. The cheese was your standard out-of-the-package Daiya vegan cheese. They didn't try to even melt it down and mix it with some sort of flavoring to boost the choices coinciding with the menu. We had the exact same chicken patty. Again, same thing I make my lunches with to take to work.What's the icing on the cake though, was my friends hamburger bun. It looks like that shit you buy at Wal-Mart, with its yellow poppy seeds and its large cookie cutter shape roundness. It wasn't vegan. I asked the guy at the front what it was and he said it was white-wheat bread, like we were stupid enough to believe that. Because it definitely wasn't.This place just pretty much does your grocery shopping for you then charges you triple the price. Nothing is organic and truly made for you, it's all frozen shit from the supermarket that they pop in the microwave. I wish Vegas would get a REAL vegan/vegetarian cafe, cause this place is pathetic.After the truth on the calorie count of the cookies have come out I have to update my review which I first did in October of '08.  Wow, I had been getting duped for a long time.  This was my go to spot for lunch with friends after a Saturday gym session, and I would often stop by for what I thought were low calorie desserts during the week.  But I cannot support a business that has been lying to their customers since as far back as 2010.  I know only the cookies have been analyzed but that is enough for me to doubt everything else on the menu and how it is prepared.  Thank you, Todd Wilbur and Jane Ann Morrison for revealing the truth about RVC.This review is for both Red Velvet Cafe locations.I'm not saying they don't serve delicious healthy food. I'm not saying their sweets are yummy. They are, for that, I'm giving 2 stars. However, I won't be returning to either locations again.http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/jane-ann-morrison/cookies-might-be-too-good-be-trueTo summarize really quick, this article tells about how people LOVED Red Velvet Cafe's infamous chocolate cookies, which claim to be only 27 calories each. Too good to be true? Yes. A Las Vegas author had these cookies analyzed and found out they were actually 157 calories! So the six-pack of cookies Red Velvet claims to be only 162 calories is actually 942 calories. Read the article and judge for yourself.I've had Red Velvet vegan cakes many times, the ones that are supposed vegan and around 200 calories. As I try to stay fit and eat a sensible diet, I always appreciate establishments who offer vegan healthy alternatives. However, if I find a food I really want it, I'll buy it, sometimes regardless of if it's low-calorie. I'll eat a 900-calorie triple chocolate cake if that's what I really crave, but at least I KNOW how much I'm eating. I know that not all eateries provide their nutritional information on their food. I understand some recipes are kept secret. However, if you are going to be proud to claim how low calorie your delicious chocolate cookies are, they better be true! I just don't appreciate the dishonesty Red Velvet Cafe displayed. People rely on accurate information on what they eat, if that information is available. Now, I cannot trust anything Red Velvet Cafe says about any of their food. Can you? Their food may be delicious, but their actions left a bad taste in my mouth.http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/jane-ann-morrison/cookies-might-be-too-good-be-true I finally have answers to my questions.... I emailed RVC several weeks ago asking for clarification of the peanut butter cookie calorie count. It raised a red flag to me because it didn't seem possible for a peanut butter cookie to only have 27 calories when the label on my jar of peanut butter reads 118 calories per 2 tbsp! (Yes I'm aware of other alternatives... But at the end of the day calories still don't add up... The 3rd party testing seems to back this and be pretty factual!)Maybe we're not all savvy bakers but something just wasn't quite right here! I'm not someone who counts calories or eats by a 'point' system but I do like to know what I'm eating. Like others have said if calories are being hidden, what else is in the food that shouldn't be? http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/jane-ann-morrison/cookies-might-be-too-good-be-trueThe only reason to go here was the excellent low-calorie desserts. It turns out they lied about the calorie content and they are actually high-calorie excellent desserts. Check the stories in the newspaper for more info. I will never go here again.Lost all credibility!We always knew the calorie counts at RVC were too good to be true...and it turns out we were right. The Las Vegas Review Journal recently tested the chocolate chip cookies and found each one had, on average, about 157 calories - nearly 6 times what was advertised!The food was ok, service left something to be desired, but outright lying about calories is deceitful and unethical.Unfortunately, I won't be revisiting RVC in the future.Questionable nutrition info aside, this place is both overpriced and lacking.Service, in a word, sucks: I've walked in repeatedly to their crappy layout and been ignored by multiple staff. You literally walk in and stand right at someone's table staring at them because there's no signage or hostess to let you know to seat yourself, wait, or approach one of the two, unlabeled counters. It's awkward. When a place hypes themselves as being "vegetarian" the menu probably shouldn't include chicken in every other dish. But hey, I understand wanting to appeal to a larger audience- every dish can be "made" vegetarian/vegan using tofu. Which is questionably nutritious, as it's processed soy, but hey...Much like the nearby Panini Café, this place somehow expects you to find it reasonable to spend $16 on a sandwich. I don't know about you, but I'd rather hit up the Strip for a gourmet burger from a celebrity chef if I'm going to pay that. And no, using organic ingredients doesn't justify it.Tried the veggie Panini and the chicken pesto Panini- pesto was missing but even with it, I'm not sure the flavor would have been saved. Everything inside the sandwich is overpowered by the bread. And not in a good way.This place is hyped as both "vegetarian"/vegan and "healthy", and "organic" with little to the menu offerings that actually fit the criteria, which trumps the fact that they make half-decent desserts.

This is the first time I have ever been here.  I really liked it. We had a great waiter, but then he was cut and we got a replacement. Though she also was very good.Our Burgers were fantastic! Cooked fully well and very fresh.Also, our waiter brewed a fresh pot of coffee for me.Endless fries as well, can you believe that.They also have this great new program, a royalty program. Sign me up I can't wait  . A free Burger the month of your Birthday and for every 9 burgers you get your 10th free. Clean bathrooms,as I went in there to wash my hands before we ate.They have a TV in the Floor near the waiting area,which I have never seen before. I thought it was really Cool!We have been to this place a few times now.  So it is safe to say I really like it!Endless fries for starters, then really good Burgers. So worth the trip.They even send you emails about all the great deals that they have going on.The thing I really like about that is you do not have to print coupons they have it all downloaded on your rewards card.So I think they really care more about the environment with that because, no ink and no paper wasted. A really good Idea!Staff is always friendly and nice,even when you call on the phone.The place is clean and the food is good.They even made me nice fresh coffee the other day.My most fun part here is the TV in the floor, I am really amused by that.Clean bathrooms and lots of parking.So this was my first time eating at Red Robin ever..... yes I said ever...... I was really excited to see that they had a mushroom burger on their menu! Not a lot of places have mushroom burgers so I was super excited to try it. When our food came out my burger was cooked to my specifications, but the taste of the burger and the mushrooms was very dull. I felt like there was no flavor or pizazz to the burger. With all the mushrooms, onions and cheese I figured this burger would be making my taste buds jump around. Instead it did the complete opposite. I ate a few bites and decided to just visit with my friend and munch on my fries. My fries were cold and kind of mushy. When I eat french fries, I like them crispy and warm. A lot of my friends love this place, so I will give it another try, just not a very good first impression. Maybe if I order something else I will have better luck! I usually try to give new places more than one shot just on that occasional off day we all have every now and then. :)Mom wanted a Burger for lunch, so we decided to head to Red Robin.  It's in our neighborhood and it's been a while since we were last here.   We like this place because of the variety of Burgers they have on the menu.  It's pretty extensive and creative.  The Bleu Ribbon Burger (Bleu Cheese, Chipotle Mayo, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion Strings, Onion Bun), $9.79 immediately jumped out at me when I browsed the menu, so I went for it.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jBs2HmEOkqCvdHNnw3N-og?select=LX8XzvXLi__N_8hn2EPUdQMom went for a Turkey Burger....she's been on a Turkey Burger kick lately.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jBs2HmEOkqCvdHNnw3N-og?select=zD0Th0NI9ydO5MA2DogVmgThe service was excellent, as usual, and the food came out quickly.  We requested our Burgers to be cut in half and they got it right.  I took one bite out of my Bleu Ribbon Burger and instantly became a fan....yum!  The Bleu Cheese and Onion Straws gave the Burger a unique flavor that tasted soooo good.  It left me wanting more when I was finished....which is the tell-tale sign for me that I enjoyed the grub.Overall, the experience was very good.Return Factor - 90%Sing it with me......REEED ROBIN.....YUM! ;)Oohhh my goodness....my brain can't think because it is SOO LOUD IN HERE!  Now I remember why back in the days I would bring my baby here.  Because no matter how loud she screams no one notices. LOL  I think its so loud that you actually have to yell to communicate with the person you are with so its all an ugly vicious cycle. Sunday afternoon we decided on a burger-lunch and thought it had been so long since we had been here.  Now we remember why. hahah The waiting area was full but must have been for a large party because our party of 2 got seated right away.  Every seat in this place was full.  Tons of large parties full of families and friends!  Maybe the after-church crowds as well.  So much I forgot about this place-not a frequent favorite just for the fact there aren't too many healthy options here.  If you can control yourself they do serve salads.  I'm just not sure how healthy they are since I'm not the one who can order salad with a menu that has fantastic pictures enticing your blurred and echoing thinking.  We were literally seated for less than 5 minutes when our waitress came to apologize for the wait.  Wait?  What wait?  Very nice girl but a little ditsy.  I don't generally go for burgers anywhere.  I usually opt for the grilled chicken for a healthier choice.  Today I was going all out.  Here's what we ordered:Whisky BBQ burger - slightly greasy bun, topped with a juicy on the inside burger with crispy onion strings and a smoky bbq sauce.  Yes I didn't go for the lowest in calorie/fat option.  It was pretty great though.  I had to cut it in fourths so I could actually eat it in a nice non-messy way.  My once a year indulgence didn't fail me...er-until just now.....SHOW STOPPER....  Might I say how disgusted I am now that I looked at the nutritional value of this burger....Oh my freakin gawd......1138 calories 70 grams of fat!  HOLY SHIT!  My hour workout that night didn't even put a dent in that!  (not even funny right now) Sniff sniff.....Tear.to continue....BF ordered a regular cheese burger with mustard and crispy onion strings.  He said it was the best he's had in a long time.  He ordered a side of coleslaw and loved it.....and don't forget the "bottomless steakfries"...its what they advertise on TV.  ...and I am not even looking at the nutritional value of these! God help me here!  I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of steak fries but I ate a few anyway.  I've seen other reviews about the seasoning on the tables.  Nothing (at all) special to me.  The fries are dry anyway and the seasoning doesn't even stick.  So "eh" on the fries. Maybe I will substitute them next time-FOR SALAD (disgusted still).  BTW we didn't need bottomless as there were plenty that we didn't finish....Thank God!Customer service is outstanding.  The manager checked on our table several times.  Drinks never ran low and our server was super attentive in the midst of her many other tables.  I am often amazed when someone can juggle all that and still be pleasant and attentive.  I know.  Yes agreed...that's how it should be.Overall the place is fun, loud and perfect to bring your really boisterous family and friends to clog their arteries!  Enjoy THAT would ya!  =)THIS RED ROBIN FLIES ABOVE 3.5 STARS   The Red Robin came to life in Seattle many years ago in 1969 as a gourmet burger restaurant. From that one restaurant, the Red Robin has flown across the American and Canadian landscape landing in several cities to take the casual dining customer under its wings. From the Pacific to the Atlantic, Red Robin has treated customers to an upbeat casual dining experience featuring a menu of gourmet burgers, specialty sandwiches, appetizing adult beverages, and dessert. In recent times, the Red Robin is soaring above some of its competition with thier bottomless fries.   Over twenty years have flown by since I last visited the Red Robin back in New York. I remember enjoying the food, but Long Islanders at the time did not take to the Red Robin causing it to relinquish it's space in the Smith Haven Mall to TGI Friday's. Twenty years later and last week, my brother and I were walking around the new-sprung Downtown Summerlin and took notice that a Red Robin is arriving the second week of November. So, yesterday after my brother and I left Floyd Lamb State Park (or Tulle Springs), it was in the top of my mind to have dinner in the Centennial Center Red Robin. And that is what we did.   When we walked into the relatively large waiting room, the attentive hostess let us know that there was a booth or table in the lounge, which is one of the two rooms in the restaurant, that she walked us to. The lounge features a bar and two large screen monitors that were at the time of the visit showing the NFL Green Bay verse Chicago game. At 9 P.M. on a Sunday the room was as quiet as a robin.   The pages of the menu displayed several burger sandwiches including the gourmet burger. My mind was set on fish and chips. These days I have been in the mood for fish and chips. Red Robin did not let me down. The three pieces of breaded fish had the right texture and crunch. The fish was the way I like it. I'd squeeze the lemons over the fish before dipping them in tarter sauce. But where was the Cole slaw? If there was that delicious Cole slaw that many restaurants serve with fish and chips, this red robin could of been flying above four stars. Where they scrimped on the Cole slaw, they were generous with the bottomless fries and Coke. Our easygoing waiter Landon was on the eight ball with the fries refills. He was kind enough to give us a portion to take home. The fries exceeded my expectations. In all honesty I thought they would be filler. The Red Robin bottomless fries is both quantity and quality. The fish and chips with bottomless Coke was worth $19 when you add in the upbeat atmosphere and good service.   Just like a red robin, the sky is the limit for the Las Vegas casual dining customer. The fact that I plan to return to Red Robin is testimony that they are doing something right. As I write this, a Red Robin is about to hatch in Downtown Summerlin by mid November. In a few weeks or less, I see a sequal Red Robin dining adventure in their newest location at Downtown Summerlin.

Review Text :
I am absolutely astounded that this "Mexican Restaurant" has 3 and 1/2 stars on yelp! The only reason why they get a star from me is the bar atmosphere, they have a great bar with good happy hour deals, but that's it. Lets begin with the food, salsa and chips...absolute crap. The salsa tastes like canned crap from a 99 cents store, bland and just CRAP, I can go to Filiberto's across the street and find salsa 10 times better than what's at Loco's. The chips are salty as h***, tastes as if they poured the entire salt shaker into the basket, VERY SALTY, i'm not a goat, but thanks! I've been here for plenty of taco Tuesdays (mainly for the drinks). The tacos run between 1-2 bucks. The dollar tacos are shredded chicken or beef and the 2 dollar ones are shrimp, mahi mahi, and new york steak.I've tried all of the tacos, the shredded chicken and beef always dry and bland, same with the mahi mahi! The only tolerable tacos are the shrimp and new york steak, but once you go to a REAL Mexican restaurant, it makes those tacos look like poop! I've had their chimichanga's, again like another poster said about the beef, they put ground beef instead of shredded like what I expected and it sucked! I refuse to try anything from there again! If I go here it's only for happy hour once in a blue moon, but that's about it. Want to go to a real Mexican Restaurant try Los Taquitos off of 48th st and Elliot and La Canasta in Downtown, those are real Mexican restaurants. You know there is something wrong with a "Mexican Restaurant" when the hamburgers are better than the "Mexican food" they serve. Nuff said.If you need a server.... you can find just about all of them sitting at the bar playing around on their phones. We had the pleasure of having Sierra as our server- whose attitude was just about as piss poor as her service. I ordered a tostada/taco lunch special, so you can imagine my surprise  when a taco and some other slop was placed in front of me. Sierra advised me the mystery item was in fact an enchilada. Ah... it's Mexican food right? Just the same shit put together  slightly different. I told her not to worry, I'd eat it anyway.  I wouldn't have mind as much... but then she proceeded to argue with me that I was wrong because when she took my order she asked me for red or green sauce."Enchiladas are the only item that come with sauce".  Not enough energy to argue with her, she immediately made her way back to the barstool where her phone was again glued to her hand. After about 15 minutes  of having dirty plates just sitting in front  of us, I thought I would do her a favor, head up to the bar with my card and pay. No use in staying  there any longer nor ever coming back. For better food and service I'll visit the Filibertos drive thru across the street.

Review Text :
Still haven't had the food here, but I did have an afternoon meeting at Scratch today and the service was attentive and the people that were in and out during the 2 hours I sat there seemed to enjoy their pastries and meals...I came home with a few bags of cookies and my brother and I had them for dessert tonight... they were delicious.  We both especially liked the jasmine flavor.  If nothing else, go to admire how pretty the pastries are and how cute the space is!I'm in  a quandary about Scratch.I walked over there for lunch today...my first time trying out Scratch.The note on the counter said "please be seated" so OK. I sat at the communal table in the middle of the room and waited...and waited...and waited. Ten minutes by my watch. Nobody behind the counter or taking food out looked at me, or acknowledged me. So, I decided I must be doing it wrong. I walked up to the counter to order and was told by the man behind the counter that "no, we wait on you" but he nicely took my order (sandwich and coke), and let me pay (BTW, I included a 20% tip up front, when I paid with my card, so I was trying to be proactive about getting good service...lesson learned) and said they would bring things out.I waited...and I waited...and I waited, while several people came in, seated themselves, were brought place mats, utensils, ice water, and their orders taken and their drink orders brought out. I finally walked back up to the counter and asked to at least get my drink order...profuse apology from the man behind the counter, gave me a bottle of coke which turned out to be frozen solid. Another trip to the counter. By this time you can only smile at the comedy of errors. They finally brought me a place mat and the rest (no, ice water never showed up), and then finally the sandwich.I suppose the sandwich, which was good, on good bread, well made and tasty, is the reason to give Scratch the benefit of the doubt and give them 2 stars (the service was below 1 star).The little salad they serve with the sandwich was fresh and the vinaigrette was tasty, so that was nice as well.Was it $11.00 + tip for a small sandwich good? Well, that is my quandary. I think at that kind of price point, the sandwich needs to be terrific, not just good. And, the service should at least be adequate, and it was nowhere near adequate.So, 2 stars for now, and maybe I will go back and try it again in a few months.Had a hunger itch we needed to scratch, so we ventured here on a late Sunday morning and let me tell you my friends...the itch was scratched...it was scratched feverishly well. Ok, enough metaphorical jib jab...I'll get to the point here...Scratch was wonderful.We went there on a blazing hot Sunday afternoon, looking for a little refuge from the heat...and of course a satisfying late breakfast. It was a little hard to locate at first...there's a lot of construction in the area, so if you aren't paying attention you'll miss it. It's in a really unassuming strip mall-ish location...the strip mall itself is surrounded by all sorts of retirement homes and centers, if you go into the Fry's next door I can almost guarantee that if you're under the age of 50, you'll be one of the youngest people there...so it's a bit odd that this trendy hip bakery/bistro is located here...I certainly can't imagine any retirees feeling too comfortable eating at a place like this (or maybe I just haven't met enough 'hip' older people). We ended up trying a breakfast sandwich (served up on a yummy croissant roll), eggs florentine, a crepe (with sugar and French butter), and a red velvet cupcake to top it all off. Everything was very fresh and had a crisp taste...both the breakfast sandwich and the eggs florentine seemed to focus much more on quality than quantity, which I always appreciate since I don't like huge portions, but would much rather savor a smaller meal...but this being said; be forewarned if you are into big portions, a single menu item here may not fill you up. The crepes were probably my favorite thing we tried...cooked to perfection and filled with some sort of rock sugar which just complimented the crepe with butter really well...it's pretty much a dessert, but I can't help but recommend it as an addition to whatever else you may try here no matter what time of the day it is. Lastly, the red velvet cupcake was just sort of okay. We've yet to find somewhere who can make a cupcake as good as Tammie Coe...but that isn't Scratch's specialty, so I can't fault them too much for it. Overall, Scratch is pretty reasonable for the quality of food you're getting (at least for the breakfast menu we had). This is yet another time when I wondered why anyone in their right mind would go to Denny's or Coco's when you can get fresher, healthier, and much much tastier food at a place like Scratch for about the same price. Makes me wanna go over to one of these chain breakfast places and bitch slap anyone who gives their hard earned money to an inferior product. 4/5.I've officially added this little french morsel to my sandwich rotation. I frequented Scratch when they first opened a couple of years ago but this little hidden cafe had unfortunately fallen off my radar as of late -- until today that is. While out and about on the town, my tummy started to rumble and I decided to take advantage of my iPhone yelp app to possibly find a sandwich spot that might not be top of mind. Scratch showed up and immediately memories came back. So I turned my car around and made a long overdue visit to Scratch. Scratch is an intimately small bakery slightly hidden within a shopping center on Miller and Indian School. But all it takes is one step inside for the character to appear. The space itself is small and relatively bare with minimal furniture, decorations or food on display. But once you glance at the menu and read the options you realize that the food is well thought out and of great quality. During my most recent visit, I opted for the turkey and avocado sandwich but I added Brie. I ordered the sandwich to-go and it was ready within minutes. The sandwich came with a mixed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette and I was ecstatic when I realized that they wrap the sandwich in saran wrap to save it from picking up any moisture from the salad. I wish that every sandwich shop did this because I can't tell you how many times I've had a sandwich with soggy bread because it wasn't separated from the sides. So thank you for that little special treat, Scratch! Moving on to the sandwich quality itself, tres bien is all I can say. The white bread was extremely soft and had obviously been made that day. The avocado was fresh and buttery and the perfect addition to the sandwich. The turkey was sliced and tasty and the sandwich in its entirety was delicious. Simply but delicious, just like the decor at Scratch. The balsamic vinaigrette was quite tasty as well and while the salad was lacking anything else besides two tomatoes, it was still nice to get some greens with the meal. While this was a great sandwich and I've also enjoyed the pastries and beverages from past visits, you do pay for the quality of food you receive. My sandwich alone without a drink or additional side was $10+. In other cities that might be reasonable but for Phoenix, it's definitely on the pricier side when you don't have a drink accompanying the price tag. But like I said, you pay for the quality of food and the quality of the sandwich was worth the $10 out of my wallet. I will just have to vist Scratch for a weekend lunch treat when I want a tasty sandwich.Scratch may have the best french toast I've ever had!  With a little caramelization on the edges and served with fresh berries, it was like breakfast and dessert rolled into one. But such a large portion, even I couldn't finish it, and that's sayin' something if you know me.  Definitely enough for two ladies to share.I was a little confused coming in, but if you're eating in, grab a table and they will take your order.  The pastry case seemed a little empty, but we arrived about 15 minutes after they opened.  Still it surprised me they didn't have any croissants ready.  That's when we decided to order off the menu.Since I didn't try a pastry and it is Scratch Pastries, I'm holding the 5th star until I try one.  I'm thinking an eclair is in my future real soon!5/9/12Was craving for a chocolate croissant for a few days, so I decided to finally try the ones offered here.  Although it was only 2:30 in the afternoon, there weren't many pastries or desserts on hand to choose from... I had my mind set on trying an almond and a chocolate, but Scratch had run out of the former.  There were three chocolate croissants left (as well as a couple of raisins), so I ordered one to go.  Decided to try it before leaving to see if I wanted to get the rest... Needless to say, I left with all three!$2.70 plus tax per choccy croissant.  Didn't have time to try the local coffee.  Perhaps next time, when I plan to come earlier to secure an almondine, or two.I liked how the tables were set up for service- the setting emitted romance already.  Can't wait to try dinner here soon...  Spied three different entremets in the cases, as well as some delicious-looking truffles.

I went here for a poetry reading/concert that a friend who was on tour had booked.  They do slam poetry once a month or something here, great readers.The place itself is totally cute.  Checkerboard floor and chalkboard signage.  The pizza and sandwich selection is ample and mouthwatering.I had an Italian cold cuts sandwich.  Served hot with red peppers and lots of cheese, this sandwich was amazing.  I think what set it off was the bread.  It was so good I knew my friend had to try it, so I traded him my second half for his meatball.  The meatball was also awesome, very saucy, good spices in the balls.The thing about this place which I love, just like Otto's in Tempe, is that it is a family run business, run with love for the people and food he serves.  When I mentioned my liking of the bread he patted a bag of flour and made a point of the fact that it is never frozen, nothing ever is, he makes the dough each day.There is going to be an expanded bakery in back, a cake shop I think.  This place is going to really hum when they have both businesses going.  Mesa is lucky.At the end of the night, the owner was overly appreciative of my friends words and music.  He asked for an encore and bought one of my friends cd's.  What a guy.

So this restaurant has provided me with a story I am sure I will tell over dinner with new friends for the rest of my life.  so, now it is your turn to hear it...I walk into Mariscos Sinaloa on a Wednesday afternoon.  I'm busy.  On this side of town and I whip out my Yelp app to see if I've book marked a place to eat in the area.  Yep, I was a mere few feet from this place.  So, I pull my car into teh parking lot and go in for a quick meal.I order shrimp chipotle and a michalada.  I ALWAYS have the michalada.  So, I'm sitting at my table waiting patiently for my food whilst I read messages on my cell phone.  Suddenly, out of no where I hear a crash and then I instantly feel COLD.  WET and COLD.  Oh yes, a waitress walking by spills an entire tray of waters and beer on me.  I was in complete shock!  Total SHOCK.  I said nothing for what may have seemed like FOREVER as everyone in the resto GASPED to see what my reaction might be.  I quickly check to see if my phone was drenched, it wasn't.  I take a moment to think... did they mess up my nicely coiffed hair?  no, it wasn't... So then I look up and FINALLY break my silence and I tell the waitress..... "Ok, so I guess I"ll be taking my food to go".  They fuss over me and ask if I was ok or hurt and I say no, as I wasn't.  I wasn't even embarrassed by it.  So, I just simply move to the other chair across the table and I reached down and continued to sip on the michalada as I waited for my food.  They comp'ed my order, naturally.  And as I was leaving, the waitress apologized again and I said, "Accidents happen, NO WORRIES!  I'll be back next week"  And so, I did go back the next week with my mom.  For me, this water experience has little to do with the rating.  I enjoyed the shrimp chipotle ALOT, except the shrimp seemed to be overcooked.My mom and I went there on a Sunday.  Packed house.  Oh and the people saying the music is loud in there, are NOT over-exaggerating.  The music was fairly loud.  It comes from a paid juke box, so it won't be like that all the time.I had the camarones diabla and my mom had the molacajete.  neither of us were crazy about our own dishes.  However, we both liked the other's.  The camarrones diabla was the spiciest that I've ever had any place EVER.  My mother likes spicier food than I and she loved it.  I, on the other hand enjoyed the milder flavor of the molacajete.  But all the meat was  a little over cooked to me.  All in all, I don't think I'll be running back here.  there's another Mexican Seafood Restaurant that's not too far from there that I like much better than this.  If you are in the area, you may like to try it out.

Review Text :
If we work together and stay focused we can help small independent coffee houses like this one overthrow the oppressive Starbucks dictatorship.  We can do it.  Drive the extra mile to go to an indy coffee house.  Yell derisive things like "Lemurs!" out the window as you cruise past Starbucks.Watch out for upstart Dunkin' Donuts as well.  The name is a misnomer, they are really in it for the coffee, not the donuts.  I know deep in their heart they hope to rise from a petty potentate and usurp the throne.Overall I liked The Coffee Conspiracy with it's hipster atmosphere and so-laid-back-it's-almost-prone vibe.  And the coffee was good.  Nothing else matters to me about a coffee house if they can't make good coffee.

Review Text :
Located inside Caesars, Java Coast is basically just a cafe that serves coffee, lattes, pastries, and gelato.  Yes, I said gelato. I couldn't help myself and had a scoop of their Peanut Butter Gelato one evening. I thought that this was a little sweet and pricey, but totally hit the spot when you're craving dessert.  In the morning, Java Coast was our breakfast of choice because it was comped. I had a bagel and an iced Americano, while the GF had some chocolate pastry and a latte. I guess we can't complain because we both finished our breakfast.  All their bagels, breads, donuts, and pastries are in a clear bin where basically serve yourself.  Although, there's tongs for you to grab your breakfast, this isn't the most sanitized way to get breakfast. After paying for our breakfast, I noticed a few people grab their bagels, donuts, and pastries with their hands.  This place should at least have signs stating to use the tongs.  As for their prices, seemed like everything was over-priced. I guess I shouldn't complaint since our meals were comped.Overall, I found Java Coast as "Just A-Ok".

Review Text :
In a world where Rex Marvin was one run over by two guys dressed as Martha Steward driving a dump truck at a high rate of speed...very little surprises Rex.  Rex has endured "surprises" that would kill a man. Rex was surprised when Kathy Bates jumped out his birthday cake wearing nothing but frosting and nipple clamps. Rex was surprised when he was sold into slavery and forced to pick coffee beans in Ethiopia...not because of the slavery, but because the food was much better than he had anticipated. Rex was surprised when he was covered in blood holding a human head high on gas fumes and giddiness from a Paula Poundstone concert...and the police want to lock HIM up. (Misunderstanding of course, anyone in a Paula Poundstone show is there to kill themselves quickly or slowly...the gentleman next Rex picked quickly.  Rex still considers a wise and wonderful man. Why was Rex there...to develop mental toughness. Sit through 20 minutes without killing yourself, and torture you will surely endure at the hands of 13 year olds with machete's forcing you to pick coffee beans faster will seem like a joke. Rex has handled these surprises and many others with dignity and class. The one surprise that Rex cannot abide...cannot fathom...cannot think of any other adjectives... is how Lucio Ristorante isn't held up to the world as the shining beacon of Italian food in Las Vegas.  Las Vegas is filled with more bad Italian food than a Danish Italian Food Expo Rex once attended in Peoria, Illinois. Those damn Danes will get theirs!  Friggin' fish salters!  They stole my beloved Italian food and then they stole my less than beloved companion, Cyclops Cindy. Old one eye...sweet girl...giving girl...the things she would let you do to that eye should be illegal...Rex thinks they might be...but nothing is too savage and vulgar for a Dane who cooks Italian food in Peoria...trust Rex on that! Rex has spent many years in institutions on the East Coast...and Rex KNOWS great Italian food. Rex know the wonderful experience those beautiful swarthy bastards can create. Rex also knows the pain of a Dane in a fake mustache...and all things in between. Here in Las Vegas there is as many good Italian places to eat as there hookers without kids...NOT MANY!  Lucio's is a find. A city treasure.First...the appetizers. The finest fried Calamari this side of the Atlantic ocean. Brilliantly prepared, perfectly battered and served with a tasty marinara sauce. The Antipasto is also wonderful and the spicy shrimp (Gamberi Fra Diavlo) is simply wonderful.  Perfectly seasoned, not too hot and excellent shrimp. The César salad is a triumph of fine ingredients and the way not to over dress greens. The signature salart is good, but Rex can't stand Gorgonzola, so he isn't a fair judge. Second, the main course...so much to say. So little time. The Risotto, their pride and joy, is TRULY the best in the city. It is impeccably done...slight bite, soft but not too soft...velvety and creamy...it is just wonderful.  Treat yourself...Rex does...to the Truffle or the Scampi. The Truffle is Rex's favorite.  The pasta dishes are all well executed, well seasoned and very generous portions...much like Rex. The Spicy Shrimp (Penne Scampi Fra Diavlo) and the Spaghetti with meatballs (spaghetti con polpettine) are real standouts.   The eggplant parmesan (Melanzane Alla Parmigiana).  The Pollo Sorrentina is a great dish, chicken with prociutto and mushrooms...delicious. One problem happens at desert. The Tiramisu is severly lacking that great espresso bite...almost none to be found anywhere. The Pastiera Napolentana is so well done Rex barely minded the problem with the Tiramisu. The Cannoli's are also wonderful and very authentic.Special mention to the wait staff. Great servers. Very knowledgeable about the food. They want to make your experience a good one. I couldn't be more thrilled with the staff. Rex has never had a bad plate, let alone a bad meal and he has eaten there 20 times. They often have specially on Groupon or other sites, and the 20 bucks for 40 bucks of food might be one of the best deals Rex has ever had. Get on their email list too! Great deals.  In this town of miscreants, low life's, and scumbags...you know...my people...all promising great Italian food...most of the liars or fools...Lucios stands head and shoulders above the rest.  Extremely reasonably priced, well cared for dishes by attentive cooks and extremely friendly wait staff...you can't do better in any food genre.  Much like an elderly Katherine Hepburn said to a young Rex Marvin "you almost broke my hip." Not sure how that fits, Rex just likes to brag.

Review Text :
One day I asked my mother if she wanted to go out to lunch. I work about 15 minutes away from her, and in the interest of saving time I told her to recommend a place we could go near her. She said she had a coupon for this place where she'd had fry-bread tacos with her friends a while ago. My inner self said: "Um... fry-bread... taco? That sounds... odd. Fry-bread. Those were the things we ate at school carnivals with honey and powdered sugar right? So... now it's in taco form? Erm... sounds... gassy." What I said to my mother was something like "Ok. Sounds great." Upon going inside the first thing I noticed was that we were the only people in the place who weren't Native Americans. This is a good thing because you can be pretty sure it's authentic, no matter what you order. The menu is short, but hearty. You indeed can get the old sugar covered fry-bread like you had as a kid if you want it. There are also a bunch of other toppings like ice cream, chocolate syrup and cinnamon as well to make your sweet tooth ache if you so desire.In addition to the sweets, they had Navajo Tacos, Apache Tacos, and my personal favorite the Red Chile and Green Chile Meat Tacos. Tribal Burgers as well as Hominy Stew round out the menu. What a great change of pace the food is! I was very pleasantly surprised when I ordered the Green Chile Meat Taco. It's massive. They allow you to order a half size too, but I'm a man right? I gotta eat the full size. The meat is delicious, and the seasoning will wake you up without making you sweat too profusely. Both the Green Chili and the Red Chili are great and very satisfying. Despite my concerns, the slightly sweet fry-bread mixed with the spicy meat was an excellent combination of flavors. If you're looking for something different, but familiar at the same time you owe it to yourself to check this place out. Location-wise it's not in a great area, but serviceable. It's in a strip mall with a big FedEx/Kinko's attached to it and across from a Food City and a 99 cent store. My only gripes are that the menu is kind of sparse and if you go into the place in a suit and tie (my work outfit) you'll get looked at funny. Just dress casual and enjoy.One day, my je'e (mother) and I were wandering around Mesa trying to figure out where in the hell we were. The Navi was on the fritz and we were both getting aggrivated. "I'm not trying to get us lost Cheryl Miranda... I'm trying to find somewhere to eat - I'm hungry!" She shouted at me while nearly sideswiping a car off of Stapley - it was our third near accident that day. "Oh... DUDE! Turn Left at Main - there's a place that has popovers!" (For my non-O'odham yelpers, Popovers is my tribe's nickname for frybread; wah-much-tha is the traditional name for it btw) "POPOVERS!! Hell no! If you want frybread, we'll go home and you can make some!""Awww... come on! It's prolly the only place around here anyway!"So we turned into a rather... dank looking strip mall (aren't they all dank looking?) and my mom nearly slammed into a drive thru sign for a small taquillia who specializes in tortas. We pulled up to a small resturant that was BRIGHTLY painted with Apache Crowndancer and large promises of Apache burgers & Navajo Lamb. When we entered we found a large airy room with a small dining room. Tables and booths to line the windows. There was a cute lil White couple dining on large tacos and huge sodas and a counter where employees took the order. We grabbed a couple of menus and then sat at a booth and looked things over."oh my gosh! haha! the ONLY difference between an Apache burger and a Navajo burger is that an Apache burger has two patties!" I giggled to my mom."Well... Navajos are really skinny." Score one for mom!"the ONLY difference between an Apache taco and a Navajo taco is that one has crushed (think refried) beans and the other doesn't." "oh what in the HELL?!" I exclaimed as I turned the menu and I saw the monstrosity they call a dessert. The "tempting" Indian Dessert... looks - (I'm so sorry to say this) disgusting! I'm sorry! Grandma never EVER put so much on a frybread! It comes with a full sized frybread topped with a HUGE scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate syrup, powdered sugar & cinnamon. It's too much! frybread has such an amazing texture and delicate flavor... it's best when hot and to dump so much STUFF on it and let it get melty and gloopy is - gross. My advice is to stick with the basics and get a LIGHT dusting of sugar OR honey. We were both a little grossed out at the thought of the 'indian dessert' and decided to finally order. I had the red chili taco with whole beans (which cost extra). Normally - at frybread stands, it's called a red chili combo but not here. The madre got a whole bean taco (navajo taco). We started to talk with the employees for a second and it turns out they are pretty friendly. We got our drinks and sat back down. I began to really get a scope of the room. Photographs of Apache Sunrise Ceremonies where plastered on the walls as well as cradleboards and small Navajo rugs. I thought it was cute and I'm glad all the art was authentic. Within a few minutes, an employee came out from the kitchen and brought us our food.The bread was normal sized (umm... I guess large to non-natives?) it had a great texture and was very fresh. I liked the redchili's flavor but was disappointed it wasn't very hot. Their hot sauce was good and I put it on EVERYTHING! My mom liked her taco as well but wished there was more salt. She in turn - then sprinkled half the shaker on our table onto her taco. We wound up ordering another couple of breads one with honey and the other with sugar and enjoyed our light dessert. Overall the food was good. I'm glad the service was quick and friendly and I'm even more grateful that the chili sauces were fresh and flavorful. The bread itself was crisp and light and yet still hearty. It takes a lot of years to develop such technique - I was quite impressed with it.the prices on the other hand... compared to on-reservation stands are astronomical but when compared to powwows and the state fair they are still a little high but when compared to other resturants - they are actually cheap. lol... odd I know. The entree`s are about $7 at the resturant but NOTHING will EVER make me to pay over $3 for ONE single tortilla! That is outrage! it should be $3 for a half dozen, but not for one thick tortilla! To my yelpers, These are real Natives. They are cooking traditional recipes handed down from generations. The bread is good. The dining area isn't anything to write home about. The prices are both decent and highway robbery at the same time.  The cooking facilities and the dining area appear very clean. The burgers and mutton appear to freshly grilled. If you're in the area - give it a try. But do NOT order that damned dessert! I don't wanna hear about one of ya'll slipping into a diabetic coma from eating it.
Brand Steakhouse=Brand was definitely one of the redeeming factors of staying at the Monte Carlo with a group on a strict budget -- good food was actually right there under our noses. Ballers for only a night just two friends and I dined here our last night to cap off our vacation in style. It was about time, too, because I had enough of McDonalds and Rubios from the Monte Carlo food court.We strolled down to the lobby and got a table with ease from the foxy hostesses around 7pm. Brand is both a steakhouse and adjoining small lounge, with the steakhouse dining room separated from the casino floor by only a waist-high counter. I was already numb to the casino funk, so it didn't bother me at all. We were seated right along the counter, a prime location for people watching.Steak, steak, steak, and more beautiful steak. I love steak and I might go ahead and say my 8oz filet mignon was probably in the top 20 best steaks I've ever had. They have all kinds of cuts, with or without the bone, and tons of sides to boot. Not quite the selection of beef at Alfred's in San Francisco, but pretty good.The dinner special for two seemed like a good idea, but sadly, by the day after Valentine's Day they were out of it. My two companions split a hefty bone-in porterhouse and added on three sides ($9 a piece or 3 for $23).For appetizers, we collectively split two cesar salads, kobe carpaccio, tuna tartare and a jumbo shrimp cocktaill. The cesar was good with whole pieces of romaine with homemade herb croutons. The kobe carpaccio was thin and buttery with capers, shaved parmesan reggiano and a delightfully bitter frisée thinly dressed in what tasted like a nice peppery balsamic, with a few slices of subpar brioche toast. The tuna tartare was mixed with crisp jicama and it came with brioche toast and a bed of watercress. So far, so good.My filet mignon was medium and had a proportionately flavorful seasoned exterior. Their porterhouse came with a bone about the size of my forearm and two sauces. Steaks come a la carte, so be sure to order something to go alongside. For $25 you can add on lobster to your steak, but it isn't a lobster tail! It's like a lobster in a thick cheesy, buttery gravy sauce. Still good, still plump, it just took us by surprise. For sides we opted for the asparagus, mushrooms and the hashbrowns. The asparagus was my fave, perfectly tender with a white dipping sauce. The mushrooms were earthy and good and the hashbrowns looked like little triangle-cut club sandwiches with bacon in the center with sour cream on the side; I didn't get to eat one because I was so full, but they made for great leftovers.Brand isn't obscenely opulent nor expensive like many restaurants in Vegas. I felt it was a great value for the money, the staff was professional and attentive and it was easy to walk in without a reservation. In addition to the two steaks, lobster, three sides, three appetizers, two salads, we had one non-alcoholic beverage, two cocktails and one glass of wine, and our bill was $240. With tip, we spent $100 per person and left stuffed.Now, they do have one special I would like to see someone order... Brand has a 120oz steak, meant to feed six people, for $267. If one person can finish it by themselves, it's on the house! AMAZING!I think I found the only reason to stay or even visit the Monte Carlo.http://bit.ly/MDJHE1Why yes, that is a 120 oz Porterhouse cured in bacon for 48 hours. When I saw the damn thing, the only words that I could muster up to descibe this masterpiece was "Meat Tower"Besides the Meat Tower, other items on the menu looked and smelled just as delicious. The full bar satisfied those who are on liquid diets and the beautiful decor and waitresses kept your mind off being hungy, that is until the Meat Tower came by your table.I think I just found Ron Swanson's new favorite restaurant. If you don't know who Ron Swanson is, I feel bad for you son.http://bit.ly/x3SgoJOK, maybe you might be at the Monte Carlo to see the Jabbawockeez.PS. The Meat Tower is meant to be shared.This is in the Monte Carlo. It's way in the back of the casino and is darkly lit. Looks very business-like.They had a special deal that weekend. Three course meal for $37... YES, PLEASE.They did give us a salad... Caesar... and it was good. APPETIZER: TUNA TARTARE - Pine Nuts, Asian Pear, Toast PointsIt was delicious. I'm so glad I got it because it was a good size.MAIN COURSE: CHILEAN SEA BASS oh YEAH! This is the good stuff. Especially... the sauce! My fiance got the filet mignon and kept dipping it in my sauce (that's what she said). It was really good. Very savory and the fish mixed with it. YES. LOBSTER SAUCE.SIDES:BAKED MAC & CHEESE - This was alright. It's not truffled... but it was still good. VERY Big. Share it.GRILLED ASPARAGUS - Standard. Dip it in my lobster sauce! :DDESSERT:NY STYLE CHEESECAKE THIS... WAS HUGE. Don't expect the Costco size slice. This is HUGE. You can share with this four people :/ After a big hearty meal. STRAWBERRY BAKED ALASKAMY favorite. It was like a strawberry shortcake really.SERVICE:Very good and attentive. Dropped my fork... got a new one instantly. We had to wave at them several times, but it was fine. We got our bill and on our way. OVERALL:If there is a deal, grab it.This place was delicious. Even wotuout the deal. Get the Strawberry Baked Alaska!From the Light Group; creators of some of the most impressive mega clubs, ultra lounges, and restaurants in Vegas, Miami, and Dubai so yes, it's impressive, contemporary, and trendy.  Smoke and mirrors.Bottom line, you're paying for beautiful plates of "contemporary" cuisine unjustified by the quality of the ingredients.  In other words, want to impress a non foodie, this is your kind of place.To start, the "Hot Rocks" (Japanese style of cooking thin slices of beef on super heated stones), fun but it's USDA choice at best and a chewier sirloin cut.  Not much internal fat, marinated in an acidic ponzu, olive oil mix causes the protein to tighten up even further.   Fun and visually cool but misses the mark. The tuna tartare, much better.  Deconstructed at service, mix everything up to enjoy.  Everyday sushi grade tuna mixed with well toasted pine nuts, crisp Asian pair and some soy with a hint of horseradish on toast points.  Refreshing and texturally interesting.For mains, no mention is made on the quality or aging of the beef.  It appears to be USDA top choice, not prime.  Steaks are well trimmed.  Cooking temperatures off.  The tomahawk rib eye cooked mid well when ordered mid rare (twice) was OK.  Not as tender as it should be.  Good bitterness from the wood burring grill but lacking intense beef flavor of a well aged piece of beef.  The menu says 24oz but a lot of that weight is the bone.  Maybe 12oz of actual beef.  The bone in Brooklyn fillet is OK.  Cooked to temperature.  The bone, slightly cut away from the beef for looks fails to impart sufficient flavor as dry aged versions of the same cut.  Pet peeve:  they put a pat of COLD butter on top of the steak.  Am I supposed to rub it around in the beef drippings and make my own sauce?Correct sides.  No real standouts.Good happy hour where you can try scaled down versions of the starters for $9.Good wine list.  High Vegas resort pricing.Smoke and mirrors a bad thing?  Hey, you're in Vegas aren't you?It was a bit empty when I got to Brand, so I was a little worried about how legit it is.  Coworker and I each decided to start with the French Onion Soup, and share the Penne Pasta and the NY Sirloin.When the Onion Soup came, it looked pretty glorious.  Super thick layer of cheese!  Whatever the 4 types of cheeses are, it tasted awesome.  Not much in terms of the "croutons" but I like it that way.  The soup itself is intensely rich, and they say they caramelize the onions for 24 hours and hell, I believe them.  The only thing was that it was very salty.  That might turn some people away, but it didn't bother me too much.The steak was a perfect medium rare to medium.  Very nice seasoned crust too.  I think the best part about the steak was the sauces that it came with.  Loved the red wine worcestershire sauce.  It's like the grown up version of your A1!  The peppercorn sauce has a nice touch too, but definitely went with the red wine worcestershire much more often.The Penne Pasta looked really simple but it is one of the better pasta dishes I've had in Vegas.  Came  prosciutto, peas, and truffle sprinkles in a rich parmesan cream sauce.  Not much in terms of quantity for the truffle, but just the sprinkles are enough.  Pasta's also cooked to a perfect al dente!Service-wise, our main server was great.  However, the other wait-staff looked like they are PO all the time haha.  Generally in Vegas, especially on the south end of the strip, I'd go to Gallagher's but now, Brand is a strong consideration for next time!I can count the number of times I paid less than $100 for a nice steak dinner on the Strip...yeah, one. This is the first one actually. A group of us went here on a Wednesday night since they were offering 20% off on dinner for locals. We got there earlier than the rest of the group so, we decided to have a few drinks at the bar which was offering 50% off bottles + the 20% locals discount.  We ended up with a bottle of Veuve Clicquot for only $35! Oh my word!I was debating whether to split a Tomahawk or the 40oz Ultimate Steak with somebody. In the end, I'm glad I listened to his decision - if the 24oz Tomahawk was hard to finish, what more the 40oz steak? The price can't be beat at $51 for a 24oz steak. The quality and flavor of the steak were not compromised though. We also got a lobster tail, garlic mashed potatoes and cream spinach.Anton's Tomahawk Rib Eye:24oz rib eye cooked medium just the way we like it. It was tender, juicy and flavorful. Careful with the huge bone though. Regular price: $51. 5/5Maine Lobster Tail:For an additional $25, you get a nice lobster tail with crushed Ritz crackers. The lobster tail is already split and sliced. 4/5Cream Spinach:The Boursin cheese makes a world of difference. This is not your boring cream spinach. Super creamy and delicious. 5/5At the end of the night, we spent about $140 for steak, a bottle of champagne, 2 sides and a lobster tail. I was so full and completely satisfied. Definitely cheap for what we got. GREAT VALUE!  They also have a 3-course prix fixe menu for $39 and happy hour from 5-8pm.Great atmosphere, great food, and great prices...but on Wednesdays, it's a RIDICULOUS deal!!Wednesdays are 50% wine bottles....and if you are local, you get 20% your entire bottom line...INCLUDING your already 50% discounted wine!!Ex : Veuve Cliquot ($85). My favorite champagne under $50 (in stores)....On Wednesdays, bottles are half price, and with local's discount, it's an extra 20% off the bottom line, so it only costs around $35!! GREAT deal...since you can't even go to Total Wine for that price most days!Started off with the Complimentary bread...we had to request it for some reason. It is sweet and slightly sticky...good stuff!I shared the 24oz Tomahawk Ribeye ($51) and Maine Lobster Tail stuffed with Ritz Crackers ($25). This is THE best non-aged Ribeye I've had so far, and the price was CHEAP! After the 20% off for locals, it's a $40 steak!! The lobster was very TENDER and flavorful, and the Ritz Cracker stuffing in the tail was delicious!  One of the most enjoyable tails I've had in town, and for a $20 bill after the discounts :PFor sides, the Cream Spinach ($9) with Boursin Cheese. I love Boursin Cheese, so this was an easy win for me!!  The Mashed Potatoes ($9) with Roasted Garlic as well...good amount of garlic flavor...tasty!  They didn't blow me away, but they are solid choices.So even at face value, this is a great steakhouse on the strip.  Are there better ones in town?  Absolutely, but considering their very fair prices, AND THEN the Wine Wednesday and Locals discounts, it's a STEAL of a deal!Check out the pics :Vegas is over-priced for it's artificial fanciness and being from LA, I'm done with the gimmicky steak places.  But WOWers place was unexpectedly great!  We got what everybody gets, the tomahawk ribeye (med rare) with lobster tail (ritz mush was grainy but I don't think you're suppose to really eat it eat it), Caesar salad and mac and cheese.  There was barely any room thanks to their large plates, but everything was delicious!  I would definitely come here again next time.  Nice dinner without a huge financial burden.The only odd thing was I asked for tobasco and they gave me those tiny hotel/airplane bottles in a dish.  None of them were wrapped/sealed and had various levels.  I really think there is someone in the back knee deep in tiny empty tobasco bottles refilling them with a huge $1.99 tobasco bottle.  They must have a really small funnel and the patience of a leprechaun.  Classy!Located in the middle of Monte Carlo Casino, Brand is easy enough to find :)  Although this is a typical upscale steak house it has Vegas style open seating meaning you can sit along a half wall and watch people go or have people watch you eat as they walk by, not my preference.  Fortunately there are more secluded booths farther back in the restaurant.Decorated in dark wood with dim lighting Brand certainly looks the part of "steakhouse" There is a full service bar and lounge area as well which showcases half priced apps and reduced drinks for Happy Hour.We ordered the Prime Rib and added a lobster tail.  The normal cut 12 ounces was $35 and the lobster tail was an additional $25.  I ordered the large cut which was 16 ounces and cost $39.00.  The prime was tender, juicy, cooked perfectly, seasoned well and just darn Yummy.  Au Jus and creamy horseradish came along with the prime.  The lobster tail was about 6-8 ounces and also steamed perfectly.  Accompanied by melted butter, there was a hidden surprise inside the lobster tail shell was a cornbread type stuffing flavored with lobster bits.  The stuffing was scrumdelicious and made for a perfect bite paired with the sweet lobster.Sides averaged $9-12 each and they had a special of 3 for $25. We tried the loaded potato, mushrooms and green beans.  The potato and mushrooms were good, but the green beans were way to "Al Dente" for us, our server swapped the beans out for creamed spinach.All the sides were good and the mushrooms in particular were very good :)Although we didn't have room for desert, we did look at the menu and prices are only $10 per desert so don't worry about desert breaking the bank if you have room to order some.Service was prompt and friendly without the "attitude" you sometimes receive in more expensive eateries.  I highly recommend trying Brand if you are looking for a good steakhouse in Vegas.  Brand has quality food and service and very reasonable prices to boot!View of the casino, good music, classy seating. I had been here many times not particularly memorable. THIS TIME, was a great one. I enjoyed being here to celebrate a birthday.  I was comfortable.  AJ gave us excellent service. We had were on a time crunch and did not have to worry about it at all.  The hot rocks was thee highlight of my meal!  Deliciously flavored, really wished there was more of it to eat!  I love anything I get to cook myself. 3 seconds on each side perfection. Told my boyfriend I'd find him a rock outside that he could cook on for his bday gift! =PWe split a bone in ribeye... Man what a bone!  I could grab it with my whole hand and just take a bite out of the steak if I wanted. (Secretly wanted to). It was cooked perfectly on the inside. Extra charred on the outside.  If this is your thing, I would recommend it.  However it isn't my thing.  I felt like it countered the fact that I wanted my one cooked medium. As we did share we also surfed our turf.  Good firm lobster tail.  The sides were smaller than I am used to.  I did think this was great because we can get more variety and still finish our food.  Mac n cheese, mashed potato, and green beans. Enough for the 3 of us to share. All really great. Mac n cheese was the best out of the 3. Birthday candle in the ice cream to top it all off!  It was a good dinner.After an eventful first day in Las Vegas; a day where everything that was planned seemed to fall by the wayside due to timing, Brand Steakhouse saved the day.After our original dinner reservations at PRIME fell through due to timing, we decided to give the Brand Steakhouse downstairs a try.  Despite many reviews talking about the lack of quality restaurants within the Monte Carlo and they do not recommend this place, I decided to heed the advice of one my co-workers and give the place a try.  We originally made reservations for 6:45 but decided to pop down around 6 to see if anything was available beforehand.  I am glad we did because the place was relatively empty and we were seated immediately which saved us time and allowed us to not rush as much to ensure we made our show on time.  Our server John was great, real down to earth, helpful in making suggestions and telling us of the specials for the evening and staying on top of everything.  We aren't drinkers so they quickly ushered away our unused wine glasses and our iced teas and water came out quickly.  Being as this was not the intended restaurant I went in with no knowledge of the menu but quickly settled on the 8oz. Filet Mignon (cooked well done) and a loaded baked potato on the side.  Yes; I know, well done and Filet do not go together but I don't like the pink and bloody steaks and am often told my steak more resembles a hockey puck or shoe leather as opposed to actual meat.  Well rest assured, Brand cooked the steak well done and it was still full of flavor and absolute perfect for my liking.  This to me is the surefire sign of a good restaurant, being able to adapt to a customers wishes and still deliver a great product.  I know a few other restaurants who could learn a thing or two from this place.  Both the steak and potato were delicious and quickly devoured.My wife, who tends to eat much lighter and healthier than I, went with the crispy chicken.  This came sitting atop a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and she seemed to also really enjoy the dish.  We decided to go with the New York Cheesecake with berry compote for dessert.  This was quite a large slice for the price and being as we were sharing it, the size was quite adequate to close out the meal.  The food, service and ambiance were all amazing and for the price this place would be hard to beat on the strip.  For 2 meals, 2 drinks and dessert our bill was $113 bucks and after a generous tip we got out having spent significantly less than we would had if our original plans did not fall through.  I would definitely recommend this place and would love to come back here again.
L & L Hawaiian Barbecue=On November 10, I had a "LONG" day!I flew to LA (Los Angeles Airport) and meet with some people for a task development. I was only down there for only 2.5 hours without eating anything. Then with the next three days off from my job, I immediately flew to Las Vegas for another assignment..."party"!After arriving McCarran Airport and becoming dark quickly at 4pm, I drove down Maryland Parkway and saw a huge "Happy Hour Special" banner in front of L &L. on Tropicana Ave. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OJofPDW-G_OPVKz84Fhbxg?select=yoqpk5PpbUZRWrHX5cqf1gThe HH special happens from 4-11pm (closing time). For $4.95, I get the Chicken Katsu meal with two scoops of rice and two scoops of Macaroni Salad. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OJofPDW-G_OPVKz84Fhbxg?select=Ct_IsOfK0QWaDPD1uykBIA  Drink is not included with the meal. So I chose a can of Hawaiian Sun: Lychee Green Tea for an additional $1.19. It has been a while since I've had any Hawaiian meal. The meal was ok..Credit card is accepted. And I know I can get L & L back home. But the price is right, plus I was starving after a long day!
Gritz Cafe=I stopped in here this morning because I love grits.  Usually I just have grits as a side when I'm at Denny's or get a small bowl at Red Rock's buffet but this is the real thing.  I got a grits bowl.  I chose the three slices of bacon and I got cheddar cheese on the top.  I asked for the egg sunny side up.  It also came with a choice of toast or biscuit and I got whole wheat toast.  I left the counter carrying my coffee cup and within a relatively short time, a young woman brought my breakfast to me.  Wow, was it good!  Break the yolk, and let it run into the grits along with the butter I had already put in.  Wonderful.The restaurant is small--nine tables.  There was a couple with two small children at the other table--I hit a quiet morning--and they were visiting from California.  That's the kind of homey atmosphere the place has.Adam, the young man taking orders today, was a very pleasant guy! This is stick to your ribs down home cooking.  What that means is that breakfast was heavy laden with carbs so I'll have to do extra at my gym workout this afternoon.  Oh the horror, but it was so worth it.Thanks to Sylvia and Nelson Q. for their heads up on this great place.MmMmmM Chicken and Waffles!I don't order fried chicken often...usually it's just not my dish.  A "soulless" piece of dried up, battered bird with no love.  First bite, deep fried grease drippin down your chin...you get the idea.Thankfully, Gritz Cafe is different...in a GREAT way!Chicken & Waffles ($10.95). Gotta be some of the BEST fried chicken I've ever had! So much flavor...so juicy...and everything tastes great with Maple syrup poured on it!  Batter has spices and flavor hiding inside, with a nice slightly crispy-crunchy consistency.Waffle was good, not mind blowing good, but combining it with the chicken takes it up to another level!  Pretty basic waffle, but the chicken is where it's at!I plan to be back to try the Catfish!  That's actually what I came here for initially, but breakfast moods swayed me!  Too bad they close so early...3pm!  But then again, I don't see myself coming here by myself at 10pm either LOLCome get some!There are certain places I refuse to go to especially alone. I'm always up for some good Southern cooking but if the area looks like I could get shot any time then, forget it! In fact, there's a place a block away from Gritz Cafe that supposedly has good catfish and a group of Yelpers actually went a few months ago. I saw pictures of the place and decided it would be smart for me not to go even as a group. I'm glad to say that Gritz Cafe is a clean, safe place with good food.They only have a few tables. The service was superb and absolutely friendly. The food was served fresh and hot. We got catfish with grits and mac and cheese, and chicken and waffles. Their sweet tea was less sweet compared to most places that serve sweet tea.Catfish:Seasoned, battered in corn meal and fried to perfection. Put some hot sauce and it's perfect! I've had terrible catfish in the past and I was also raised to not eat catfish since "it's a bottom feeder that eats garbage" so for me to like this speaks highly of this place. 5/5Chicken and Waffles:I'm a Roscoe's fan so I would have to compare their chicken and waffles with GC's. GC has 4 huge chicken wings. Roscoe's lets you choose what parts you want. BUT GC's fried chicken was just as delicious. Super hot (temperature-wise), crunchy and well-seasoned. As for the waffles...well, they were marginal. Nothing special...Roscoe's waffles are sooo much better. Even the guy at the next table thinks so! 3.5/5
Waverly's Steak House=The only thing I can rave about here is the portabello fries- they're incredible. Thick slices of mushroom, lightly battered, and served with a great creamy dipping sauce. Definitely start your meal off with an order.But everything else had issues, including the service.Lobster bisque was delicate to the point of bland, and tasted more of clams than lobster. Wedge salad was fine, bleu cheese crumbles were so small that it was hard to eat on the salad and most was left behind on the plate. Lamb chops were cooked perfectly to medium-rare, as ordered, and nicely seasoned, but were very fatty, with a thick rind of gristle on each piece. Service was polite, but I don't like how I was charged to purchase a side when I subbed a vegetable for the included potato. Server said there'd be a small fee, which I'm fine with- instead, I was rung up for a full side order and simply didn't receive one with my meal. If you can't do substitutions, just say so. I guess they're trying to pad the bill since there were only four tables on a Friday night.
The Side Door Corner Store=I am struggling to give this four stars.  Really solid 3+ and I'm feeling generous. Had a Blue Burger.  It was good. They certainly didn't skimp on the meat, the blue or the fixins.  The hamburger was a bit dry however and I wasn't blown away by the service or the food.  I may go back, but I'm in no big hurry.Not really noteworthy.
Adam's Ribs=Ok -- see below referenced wet behind the ears server... I popped in here today for a quick sandwich -- it was late, 1:20.  So I figured it would be an easy place to grab a quick bite.  Since I was alone, I headed into the bar -- barstools... -- but wet-ears (asian kid, spiky hair, glasses) directed me into the dining room where there was only 1 table of 2 occupied...  "ugh they're doing work in the bar..."  "Sit here, there's more ac" (it was goosebump cold and completely unnecessary).   When I asked him where the ladies room was, he replied "(beavis-y)  uhhhuhh, they're doing work in the men's room, so you'll have to hold your nose if you want to go to the bathroom."   Since we both knew that I needed to go to the restroom, I ordered quickly -- slider combo and an arnold palmer.   "uhhuh, our uh lemonade thing isn't working so we don't have any"    I ordered water.  Then five minutes later, he sheepishly returned,  holding glass,  "uhhuh, I asked the bartender if he could make lemonade so if you don't like it, no problem..."  (lemon, water, sugar -- yeah, tough) -- not even a full glass, then add iced tea.  Hard.  Real hard.15 minutes after that...after watching him chat away with hostess/manager/whatever -- he comes skulking back to the table "um, I have a confession... we don't have any brisket."   It's been 20 minutes -- and he's just now telling me no brisket -- are you kidding me?   So, I ask him, as I survey the entire empty dining room -- if he thought that his service, the poor communication with the kitchen, the lameass excuses had anything to do with the state of their business?   "uhuh, maybe, it's just me."   Ya think?   Do you think that folks who come in here for lunch have time for this foolishness?  Get your act together -- and quickly.  Then I do what I haven't done in ages -- I left.  I asked him what I owed him for the bad arnold palmer (he correctly answers that it's on the house)  and I stood up and left.  Couldn't believe it.  They have bloody no business, and they think this bozo is helping them keep customers. Open letter to Adam Carmer -- Hotel School Professor and (allegedly) Restaurateur:Dear Mr. Carmer, BBQ margaritas aren't enough to sustain or build a restaurant -- let alone a good or truly satisfied restaurant clientele.  Good food, genuine service, great values are.  Your Maryland Parkway operation is a joke.  Please, if you want your substantial investment in this location (which is much appreciated, by the way)  to matter, tap into your healthy employee base (I'm sure you have a few employees who would be interested in picking up some add'l shifts), and bring some experienced talent over.  Better yet -- you don't need a hostess/manager/multiple servers when you have (ahem) NO BUSINESS.   Get those girls on the floor -- teach them about the food and make them earn their money.  Simply reprinting menu placemats does not build business -- oh, yeah, you might have the girls read the menus too...understanding your food and the things that matter to you.  I've found, as I've meandered through the food business, that typically it's helpful, and your customers appreciate it when staff can answer questions, instead of staring at you like you've asked them to create world peace on a plate.   Oh and in case you thought I was pussyfooting around the issue, I won't -- fire the spiky haired kid -- seriously.  Foodservice is not his calling.  I'm sure something is -- but do him, you (and your guests) a favor and please, please cut the chord so that no one has to put up with his lame excuses, and worse than that his mind bending business-ending behavior ever again.   And you might drop me a note when he's gone -- maybe then I'll return.  Yep, that bad.One more thing, your cook at the Flamingo location cooks circles around -- your crew at Maryland Parkway.   Oh, and from what I've seen, he can run the whole damn place singlehandedly -- and is happy and proud to do so.  His food is worth returning for -- as is his attitude.  Send him over to fix Maryland Parkway, or it's truly doomed.  Better yet,  get yourself in there to run things.  Throw the rest of them out, and show us what it is that you know.  Introduce yourself to your guests -- hell there are only about 2 of them, so it shouldn't tax you too much.  Maybe then you'll begin to rebuild your business the old fashioned way, one happy customer at a time.
Espressamente Illy=The lychee gelato was dilizioso! I let each scoop melt on my tongue so I could enjoy every ounce of it. 1 scoop for $5.50 better be worth it!Nicole loved the iced mocha drink so much that she shelled out $7.50 for it. On two occasions. They must have shipped that coffee in directly from Italy.It's Vegas. INDULGE!We arrived in Vegas and were ready to shop, but we needed a little sustenance first.  We were looking at the Venetian/Palazzo map when an employee asked if we needed help.  We told her we were looking for something quick to eat and she directed us to Espressamente.There was a good selection of food to choose from....crêpes, sandwiches, wraps, desserts and gelato.  I ended up getting the Italian club wrap( http://static1.px.yelp.com/bphoto/rmfDHoAyYCOlM0ELJmur_g/l ) and a bottle of water.  The wrap was pretty big and very filling.  No desserts for any of us.  We had dinner a few hours later, so we didn't want to overdo it.  The gelato seemed to be a hit, though.  My lunch came out to $12.92.  Not too bad considering it was Vegas.  It was definitely a good spot for a quick snack.  Next time I'll try the coffee and gelato.This review is based on their gelato which was only A-OK.So I was craving dessert like crazy in Vegas and especially something cold and creamy with it being triple digit weather there at the time. I initially wanted to check out Serendipity 3 and their frozen hot chocolate after I had been reminded of it by my friend Sally. But that never happened as Camellia C. said she preferred to go to New York for the original Serendipity.Anyway, walking around the Palazzo to kill time after a big brunch at Bouchon had me fiending for gelato to cool down.  At Espressamente Illy, two scoops of gelato will cost you around $7 and with that you'd think you'd get some pretty good gelato. It wasn't the bad but it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. Maybe it was because the Spumoni scoop was mixing with the Mango scoop to create an not so flavorful mixture of tastes. I still cleaned those bad boys out as the scoops are definitely on the small side. Which totally sucks when you just overloaded on the Rio Carnival Buffet's gelato bar the previous night. I wasn't going to leave Vegas without checking out at least one dessert place but I ultimately left unfulfilled and will have to come back to scour out different places for gelato/ice cream next time.
Lindo Michoacan=Met several old colleagues here for lunch today.  It was the first time I've been to this location, so I was kind of excited to give it a try.  The location is conveniently located off the 215 & Flamingo Rd.....so it was easy access for me and them.The traditional Lindo's Chips & Salsa is served here, complimentary.  It has the same fresh, awesome taste as the other locations.  Good start.After browsing the menu for a little while, I settled on the Lunch Special #3 "Tres".....Beef Chimichanga.  I was going to order a Dos XX or a Pacifico, but since my friends were on lunch from work, I didn't want to throw it in their face that I can drink at lunch and they can't....so I abstained and had an Iced Tea.The food came out pretty fast.  The Chimichanga comes with Rice, Beans, and Sour Cream & Guacamole on the side.  It was cooked just right.....the fried Tortilla was crispy, flaky, and not greasy.  The Beef was shredded and full of flavor.  I like to get their signature Salsa and pour it on top of the Chimichanga....because the Salsa packs a lot of heat and has that Smoky Chipotle flavor to it.  I mixed the Beans & Rice together and devoured the plate.The service was excellent and everyone had a good time.  We spent an hour after lunch talking and catching up on stuff.....even though we settled our bill, the server ensured our glasses were full and that everyone was ok.  It's the signature service I've come to know and love about Lindo and his restaurants....glad to see it was the same here.Will I return?  Of course!I've been here on a few occasions. The interior of the restaurant is really dim, especially in the day time. You might need the light from your cell phone to light up the menu if you don't happen to have bat vision. Service is great. The moment we walked in the door, the hostess greeted us warmly and seated us at a table of our choosing. A moment later we were seated our waiter and busboy both came by to take our drink order and bring us chips, respectively. Our drinks never went empty and our server was always ready to fulfill all our requests. It's definitely not my favorite Mexican food in town, the spice level is definitely toned down and I wish the flavors were just a little more dynamic. I have ordered quite a few things off the menu and have never really been blown away flavor wise, but it's definitely solid. On this occasion, I ordered a shredded chicken burrito, which was huge for the price. It definitely needed more flavor, but it was still a pretty good meal. I'd be back, if I'm in the area again... I'll just make sure to ask for extra chile or spicier salsa on the side.Nothing special.  Refried bean dip is bland, chips needed salt. The oysters are good! Carne asada was tender but lacked seasoning.  Customer service was good. Would I come  back? ... nope.
Charleston's=We came here again the other night for dinner. I have always enjoyed my meals at this place. Again ,I was not disappointed.My girlfriend got wine and I an Ice Tea, they kept it filled the entire time. I really like their Tea,what ever brand it is ,I would like to buy. It is never too bitter or sweet.We both got the chicken and ribs. The ribs are so tender they just fall off the bone. I am not joking about that. They are really good as well. You notice when you are outside as you are walking up the smell is marvelous! Yes, I said it Marvelous!Everything in here is always good. We even got some food to go so we could have it the next day.Nice staff and good food, sounds good to me and we will be back many times in the near future.Lots of parking in the lot.We came here on a Saturday Night. They were very busy! they even had a waiting list.But, when we walked in we were lucky enough to be seated right away. No other party of 2 were on that waiting list, so that is why.Service here is spectacular!  Food was great! We got the shrimp cargot as an appetizer.  was very good, but the very best part of the meal.??? The Ribs. As always they were amazing. They fell right off the bone, they were tender and delicious!Great service, great food, and lots of parking. You cannot ask for much more than that.
Joe's New York Pizza=I found myself singing the tune of "That don't impress me much" in my mind during my food session.I tried the lasagna pizza at their suggestion as this was my first time and they had quite a few ready made pizzas available by the slice.The toppings were great, the concept of lasagna style topped pizza is a great concept!However where they fail miserably is the crust. The pizza crust is thin, limp, flavorless and soggy which does not support the toppings. I don't want anything that is limp in my mouth, especially when it comes to pizza! The crust was just bad, bad and more bad. No happy ending here :(Hit it and quit it, I am done!Really great pizza, and excellent service. Some of the best pizza in vegas!!!!! They have pizza by the slice,  tons of choices.  Pasta, chicken. Wings and sandwiches.  Really a great place.they close at 9 would  be nice if they were open longer... delicious ...
Baldwin Barmacie=Really don't get the hype around this place. I'd been once before in the early evening on a weeknight about a year ago and enjoyed it, but my more recent experience there on a Friday night was horrible. I'm a native Montrealer who now lives in NYC and came here with a friend from New York -- we both enjoy the cocktail bars in New York (Raine's Law Room, Little Branch, Weather Up...are some of my favorites) and I thought this would be a good place to go and try to impress people with what Montreal has to offer.There was so much wrong with the place this time that I don't even know where to start but I guess I have to somewhere.For a supposed "cocktail" bar, the drink list and quality is severely lacking. You need to offer something more interesting than a mojito or apple martini if you want to distinguish yourself from any crappy lounge/club on St Laurent. Moreover, the drinks should actually be good: Ours were way too sweet and unbalanced.(I also thought it was hilarious they couldn't make a Pimm's Cup because they were out of Pimm's! How does a bar run out of the base for one of the few drinks it offers??? That's like KFC running out of chicken.)Next, it was way too crowded. That wouldn't be terrible but this place is aiming for a certain sophistication (which it laughably misses). Instead of letting every single person outside into the bar, I'd rather just be made to wait outside for a bit until it clears out inside. It wasn't enjoyable having people pressed up against my back or waiting 20 minutes to make/get a drink order because the staff were overwhelmed.The crowd is amazingly douchey in a Jersey Shore way. Tanktops, basketball shorts, Wu-Tang t-shirts -- name the douchey clothing item and some guy there was wearing it. Absolutely classless, really. A little door policy would go a long way (shit like that doesn't fly in NYC), but clearly Baldwin Barmacie doesn't care.Music was deafeningly loud and a bad blend of generic house and techno. Again, is this a club or a cocktail bar? I'm sorry, but hipster staff in Coke-bottle glasses and long spoons in drinks does not a cocktail bar make.Finally, it's not even nice in here. Sure, from afar it seems cool. But look closer (or better yet, just sit down). The tables are dinky and tiny, the chairs are dirty and the long bench against the wall is covered in some sort of cheap rubber-pleather.Going back to the beginning, the main problem is that the drinks suck. They're not at all interesting, they use cheap liquor (plastic handles...also, soda guns on the non-alcoholic side, instead of real stuff), are weak and they don't taste good. The bad crowd, bad music, and bad service don't help, either... but ultimately, the drinks just suck.Really wondering if I went to the same bar as everyone who gave this place 4 and 5 stars or if they just have no frame of reference. Barmacie Baldwin should either stop halfassing the cocktail bar thing, or give up and become just another bar in Montreal with crappy overpriced drinks (let me get one thing clear -- I'm perfectly happy spending 17 bucks on a good drink but the ones here aren't worth even 12) and greased-up shaved-head dudes in beaters.
Cafe at Harrah's=The Cafe at Harrah's really shouldn't be as busy as it is.  Located next to Ming's Table, the long line is easily misleading.The 24 hour cafe serves up your standard fare.  They have a special breakfast menu from 6 am to 11 am, and then an all day menu.  Posters advertising their lunch specials for $7.77 are what brought us in yesterday morning.  (And I'm sure it brought many others in, as well.)  When we finally got seated, the breakfast menu was brought out and we asked about their lunch specials.  There were only three options to choose from and they looked far from special.  (I wish the waiter had offered the all day menu to peruse as well.)  There was a steak special that started at 2 pm, and our waiter was quick to tell us he didn't recommend it.  (We appreciated his honesty at least!)I ended up with the Corned Beef Hash breakfast ($10.99).  It comes with two eggs your way, hash browns, and choice of toast, bagel, or English muffin.  Yes, the corned beef hash was salty and basic.  I was a bit disappointed.My aunt ordered the Bone-In Ham and Eggs Breakfast ($14.99) and it was a hearty chunk of ham.  She had leftovers.My other aunt  ordered the Lox and Bagel ($10.99) and it was accompanied by an herb spread, capers, a hard-boiled egg, red onions, and tomato slices.  The breakfasts took a little while to arrive, which was surprising when our neighbors got their food way before we did.  Our water glasses were rarely refilled, we actually helped ourselves to their makeshift water/OJ station right next to our table. We didn't appreciate the extra $1.99 charge for salsa that appeared on our bill.  (Uh, don't they usually tell you when things cost extra?)Overall, it's expensive and not worth the price.  My mistake was not planning a breakfast/brunch place ahead of time because we would have paid more for better food and better experience.  With this price, you might as well go to the lunch or breakfast buffets instead!$5.99 Steak and Eggs Special. Daily midnight to 6am.Small portion. Nasty tough steak. Liquid eggs.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/G9OOkWH5rLHN3DKNPMv1lg?select=3Vvmnss0ZjMdoeiPnXH_3Q)The server was horrible. Party of 9, he refused to take our orders on paper. Instead he made us raise our hands. First with the steaks: "Who wants medium?" "Who wants medium-rare?"  Then with the eggs: "Who wants what?" It was even more frustrating since he couldn't remember our orders and had to ask again.Don't ever come here for the Steak and Eggs Special. (Read my previous review)My brother-in-law and I dropped in here between microbrew stops on our little tour of Vegas microbrews.  As best as I can recall it was around 11:30 at night and we realized that besides a light meal we split earlier in the evening we hadn't had dinner.  After leaving Sin City Brewing and walking around debating where to go next hunger crept up on us.When this happened we were in front of Harrah's.  So we walked in and ambled our way around to the Cafe at Harrah's.  The prices were reasonable and the food was reasonably mediocre.  We each had a 1/2 sandwich and bowl of soup.Our service was bizarre.  We were sitting caddy corner and the waiter first approached from behind both of us, silently appearing like Dracula from out of nowhere.  The rest of the meal he would only arrive in this manner.  When he left the check I put it out on the table where he would have to come to the front of the table to reach it.  After he had walked by several times without picking it up I suggested that maybe he would only get it if it were on the corner between us and he could grab it  from behind.  I moved it there and within a moment he slipped up from behind and nabbed it.  By this time we were referring to him as our backdoor friend.
Jim 'N Nick's Bar-B-Q=Alright look, I'm a california girl.  I don't know much about authentic BBQ really... but I do know what tastes good.IDK what it is about the beans here, but they are like crack.  I would come here and just eat the beans.  Wholly mother of god they are good.I had a pulled pork sandwich that was good.  It lacked spice but I fixed that right up with their habanero bbq sauce.  That sauce was so damn good I just wanted to put the bottle in my purse.  Then I realized I couldn't take it on the plane... so I held back.We had six people (well, 5 and a bebe), and the bill was only $80.  Not bad.  Service was awesome.  Just don't serve me that sweet tea when I order tea, OK?!  If I don't use words like, "y'all" when I order, then understand that we west coasters don't get down with that sugar water.  Blehhhhhhchh.When I put a little of the habanero sauce in my beans it's like, OMG, this might just be the best thing eva. EVAHHHHHHHH
Cadillac Ranch=If I could give this place negative stars I would. I have never been so humiliated in my whole life. I was there on a sunday evening for my 21st birthday and they denied my I.D. even though I had my social security card, my bank card my school I.D. and my medical card. I was made to stand up in the middle of the restaurant, take off my shoes, sign my signature twice, call my friends phone to show my name and still denied service. At this point I was in tears as my two friends asked if we needed to pay for the fries we did not even touch and the manager said NO.  As we left to go to Dave and Busters next door the manager from Cadillac Ranch had called there and said we "refused" to pay and we were not let into any of the surrounding restaurants. Keep in mind this was my 21st birthday.  I will make sure that NO ONE I KNOW will EVER go to Cadillac Ranch.I went there this last Monday for happy hour and dinner:  Most of my experience was positive....until the end. We did have a few small service issues, most of which are typical of a fairly new staff in training.  However, we did have a big problem regarding our bill at the end.During our meal on 8/31/2009 (dinner time), the manager came by and asked how everything was going, we let him know that it was great but to please send by our waitress as we hadn't seen her in awhile. When we received our bill, we were pleasantly surprised to see a few items comped to a 0 dollar charge.  I grabbed my card and gave it to the waitress to pay the tab of approximately $14.50. I was quite surprised when she returned the card and receipt (which had now been charged to my card) for more than $36.00 without even mentioning it to us.  She had also removed the original receipt and put a new one for the correct amount.I asked to see the manager, who came buy to discuss this with us.  Here is a quick breakdown of the conversation:Question from manager: Did we eat the items?Answer from me: Of course we did...the issue wasn't that we were paying for them, it is that your staff substituted the receipt for a different one, charged us more than double what I authorized, and didn't notify us.  How can you do this without at least letting us know that you changed the amount?Answer from manager: Well I am hearing a different story from her...she indicates that she told you.  Plus we have already given you a good break on the prices of your drinks.Response from me: First off,  don't take it from me....ask the 3 other people at the table.   Secondly, it was happy hour...these were your advertised prices.  How is it that you gave me a "break" on your prices?Response from the manager: Look, what is it that you want from me?  You ate the food, it was a computer mistake....can I have your business card?Response from me: My business card, what does my job have to do with this?Answer from manager:  It looks like you just left from working in a restaurant by the way you are dressed?  At this point...I signed the receipt and left.  Zero tip of course (sorry to be an jerk...but I was not happy.)To be honest, I don't remember ever being more frustrated with someone before.  I really wasn't expecting a free ride or meal, but an apology and explanation of HOW you can replace the original receipt with a new one for more than twice the original amount and charge it would have sufficed.So, I wrote a review on this place a while back about how this place was unfriendly to tattooed people and wouldn't even let me get close to the front door and was pleased to see that I got a little apology from the owner. But when I read the actual comment she left, it was this "Thank you for taking the time to write this review. I apologize your level of service expectations were not met. It's our mission to please every customer with wonderful food, outstanding service, awesome entertainment and speedy service.Sincerely,Jessica (Marketing/ Event Coordinator) Cadillac Ranch Tempe"First of all Jessica, I didn't actually experience any service at your establishment, or even had a chance to have my expectations met or not. My experience wasn't the kind that you can go, "Sorry for the service"  And Thank you so much for cutting and pasting this generic apology on every bad review Cadillac ranch gets. (Didn't think we would notice that?) By you doing that, It honestly just showed me that you truly didn't care about making it right at all by actually reading what happened in my experience there and apologizing for it. Instead you picked all the reviews with one star and stuck the same apology over and over hoping that would be enough to appease the public. I would say I have never been so insulted in my life but if you actually take the two minutes out of your busy day to actually read my review this time. you will obviously see otherwise. Thank you "Jessica" and Cadillac ranch staff for once again showing your true colors when it comes to customer service by doing the bare minimum. Next time actually read the review.   -Thank you-Don't be fooled by happy hour prices. I went yesterday and the waitress talked about 1/2 price appetizers, drinks, well drinks, etc. That price is only good at the bar. If you are at a table you will not get it. I went with some friends and we ordered drinks and appetizers. An order of chicken wings, an order of pretzels, 2 double vodka & 7ups, a single vodka & 7up and 4 coke & crowns. All ordered before 7pm when happy hour is over. Total price $ 71. Someone in management must have ridden that bull and hit their head - and the waitresses false advertise until the bill comes. If you are out for a happy hour in Tempe drive on past this place.First of all, I'm out to have a good time on my birthday. The id checker told me that my birthday was yesterday even though it was 11 pm on my actual birthday. Then we get in and the bartender (male) looks over at the female bartender and goes, "are you going to get them?" to which she rudely replies, "no you get them". Everyone was rude from the get go. We just went to check them out. I give good reviews where ever I go. But I felt bombarded with rudeness and hated it. We walked out in less than 5 minutes. Don't do it!
Bobo China=Bobo China baby! Fresh! Tasty! Generous! Wok! Fantastic service!!! I have eaten here many times, take out and dine in! Is great either way! I love my FREE cup of egg drop soup while I am waiting for my takeout order! Garlic chicken is really good! Crab Rangoons! MMMMM Yes order these tasty critters as an addition to your meal! They also have great dinner combos that include, a jumbo fried shrimp, egg roll and crab rangoon! Can't go wrong! Filling for a great price! I have to thank my Yelper sis Nikki H. for introducing me to this great find! Great food and great service every time I visit, you can't go wrong! You will be hooked once you try it!I love me some Bobo China!Had lunch here the other day and my friend had the kung pao chicken and I had my usual fried shrimp dinner. All dinner combinations come with 1 crab rangoon, 1 egg roll, 1 deep fried shrimp w/fried rice and a cup of egg drop soup. Mmmm yummy and filling!Great value and quality as always.The service can not be beat!I love how the food is all fresh from the Wok and piping hot upon arrival!Still a very strong 4!
Molly's Tamales=Molly had a stand at the Westgate farmers' market, and I tried one of her (full-size!) samples of red pork. It was very tasty and moist, if not as spicy as I would like. She did say that you can request that your dozen be made spicier. It was also really full of meat. She also said that she only uses really good cuts of meat, and no lard.However, I passed on buying a dozen, as I thought $26 was a little high, and I wanted to try some more elsewhere.
City Square Cafe=OK. So I've only had a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese. I'm not a New Yorker. I'm not a bagel expert. I know the yelp debate on this culinary disc can get more heated than a black leather seat in Phoenix in July. But each time, it's perfect. Cream cheese is spread evenly on the bagel. Bagel is cut in half and wrapped in white paper. I hate the places that serve you cream cheese in a little squeeze packet. UGH! I never get all the cream cheese out and end up cutting it open and licking it out. Like the lady in the commercial squeezing ketchup packets at home into her ketchup bottle to save money.The gentleman behind the counter is friendly and remembers my name even when I don't. The menu has pastries, hot breakfast and hot lunches. You can also grab fruit, yogurt and Snapple. There's plenty of reading material and the decor is simple yet comfortable. It's tucked away at City Square Plaza (gee, thus the name)...next to the Light (De)Railed Cafe. Yep. It's 86'd. Thanks City Square Cafe...for allowing me to make a pit stop on my way to work. Those three blocks can be grueling in the summer and it's refreshing to cool down a bit before walking 200 yards to my job.
Flatbreadz=Tried to be healthy and get a bite to eat here instead of the junk food restaurants at the airport.  Only one person in line ahead of me, 4 employees doing nothing, I waited 5 minutes, got frustrated, and left.  Why 4 employees would waste people's time like that is beyond me.Instead I went to a Burrito place and overpaid for a boatload of calories I didn't need.Will I return?  I might have caught them on an off day, so I will try to come here again next time.  For now, 2 Stars.
Mario's Pizza=We avoided this place, for the first few months after it opened, just because it is hard to make a left out of the plaza that it sits in. Mistake! I really like the NY style pizza (by NY style, I mean crust is neither really thin nor really thick, really tasty sauce use sparingly, and lots of cheese), and just love their wings - nice and vinegary, with as much heat as I want or don't want. The service is always pretty fast, the restaurant is spanking clean, and there are big, flat panels hung around the place... and there's always a game on. They were running good pitcher specials, whenever the Suns played. I've not had their Sicilian style, sandwiches or pasta dishes, but from watching other patrons enjoy them, they must be good! The most expensive item is NY style steak pizza or a specialty Sicilian, around $18, and a pitcher of beer is about $7-8. Wings run about $6 (10 piece) to $15 (30), and they do have an everyday special - the usual large pizza and 20 wings for under $20. I recommend this place, for the locals. Time to dump Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's... this is a local business that is worth supporting!
Maam Bolduc=Poutine: thick and rich peppery gravy , crisp french fries and appropriate cheese. The poutine vegetarienne is excellent also, but the traditional poutine will do just fine. This is the best poutine in Montreal, right ahead of Poutine Lafleur in Verdun. Born and raised in Quebec, whenever I visit this is the ONE poutine that I want to go to again. And always do. Darn it, now I want one and I'm 600 miles away. Please christmas break, come faster.
Sage Kitchen=I love going here for lunch!  I have been there several times because it is close to work and I have to get out of the office!  I love the soups here. Just had the vegetable and the ingredients were so fresh.  The salads are also very good.  I have tried the blueberry wrap and that is one of my favorites.  I have heard from the owner that she will even be delivering to office buildings in the area.  This is the best place to go if you like everything fresh.  Perfect vegetarian spot!The food? Absolutely amazing.And that's where it ends.As a vegetarian, I am always looking for new places to eat. I work near Chakra and a co-worker and I decided to head over there on our (hour) lunch break. We walked in and saw a sign that said "please wait to be greeted!" so... we did. For almost ten minutes. A few employees glanced at us and didn't say anything. Finally, an employee told us we could "sit anywhere we wanted" - why did we need to wait to be greeted, then? Oh well. The food isn't cheap. A tea and the Nutty Raw-vacado ran me nearly 20 bucks with tip. Our server was all right, but it took ten minutes just to get her over to get our drink orders. Another 25-30 minutes passed (we were looking at around 1:45 and we had to be back to work by 2PM) and our food was finally out.And it was REALLY good. The plate was overflowing with greens and my sandwich was delicious. We stuffed our faces pretty quickly - I didn't get to enjoy my food half as much as I would've liked! My co-worker mentioned that last time he had eaten at Chakra, he had ended up having a nearly 2-hour lunch because of the slow service. I hate to say it, but, for almost all raw food, what the heck is taking so long in the kitchen?As delicious as the food was, I have to say - I probably won't be back to Chakra.Chakra easily gets 4 starts in my book because if I try to access the website at work it is blocked - "The Websense category "Supplements and Unregulated Compounds" is filtered." You know it's got to be good stuff if it's filtered at work, all the best stuff is filtered at work.Onto the cafe...I should really visit Chakra more often. It's actually healthy Vegan food, usually when I head out we are going for more of the junk Vegan food variety but for 2011 maybe I will make some changes.....maybe not. The food is great, I had soup and the their version of a quesadilla. Everything had great flavor and wasn't heavy on anything besides the good healthy stuff. Place is very chill and waitstaff was great.My only complaint being that when I entered I was not sure if I was supposed to seat myself or wait to be seated. I stood there for a few minutes like some protein deficient vegan moron and subsequently got ignored a few times till I finally just asked and was seated. Also, everything appears to be healthy here and they make it a point to tell you on the menu, yet they also make it a point to exclude ALL soy products but they have dairy products??! What?! Ok, not all soy products are created equal and there isn't much concrete evidence surrounding this great soy debate anyway. You won't lose me as a customer but I wouldn't mind if there was some organic tofu or tempeh on the menu either. Just know I am laughing inside that you are including dairy products but excluding soy and I will drop it. In total I guess that is two complaints.Don't let my minor annoyances discourage you (most of my annoyances are relateable by .5% of the population), this place is solid with solid healthy food. I would not give it 4 stars if it wasn't. Go eat and enjoy.I recently read somewhere that Red Raspberry leaf tea is beneficial during pregnancy, and that it specifically helps to strengthen the pelvic and uterine muscles so that once labor does start the muscles will be more efficient.  Hmm... considering I'm past my due date, I figured it couldn't hurt to get some of this stuff!I'd dined at Chakra 4 Vegetarian Restaurant once before and had a lovely experience... it's not my typical meal as everything there is vegetarian or vegan, but it's healthy and almost like a unique escape from my usual rotation of restaurants.  So, when I decided to search for Red Raspberry leaf tea, this place came to mind, and they delivered!Jared joined me for lunch here, and I was pleasantly surprised that he really liked it... Maggie was our server and couldn't have been sweeter.  Jared started with an iced chai tea and ordered a wrap / soup combo for his meal.  I went with the Red Raspberry leaf tea and had "Chef Justin's Special Raw Living Raw Living Garden Burger" for my meal.  (See pic of menu description).  The food here is pricey but I guarantee you will feel super healthy no matter what you order!  We opted out of dessert both visits, but there were plenty of delicious looking options to choose from, so save room if you'd like to end your meal with something sweet.I took some of the Red Raspberry leaf tea home with me and have been drinking a ton of it in hopes that I will have an easy labor/delivery real soon.  The tea was very moderately priced when taken to-go by the way, which was a pleasant surprise.  Regardless of what happens in the next few days, I do recommend Chakra 4 Vegetarian Restaurant and their tea room, and I will be back!
Gluten Free Creations Bakery=I love, love, love this place!  I randomly found this bakery online while searching for a bakery to make gluten free wedding cakes in Arizona.  I called them up and they were the most accommodating and helpful people ever.  They took on the challenge of making my gf wedding cake even though they had never attempted to make a wedding cake before and they made the best gf cake I've had.  The guests at my wedding were clamoring for my cake even though we had a regular one for everyone else!  When my husband and I visited GF Creations they had a tiny 3 table bistro just off to the side of the bakery.  I'm not sure if they still have it, but it was cute and we were able to sit down and eat.  I had a burger on a gf hamburger bun and my husband had a gf reuben.  Very tasty.  I would also highly recommend picking up a pie if they happen to have any when you visit.  I tried their cherry pie and it was awesome.  Overall I think this place is a dream come true for any gluten free person out there (they also cater to other allergies as well).  If you ever find yourself in Phoenix you must check it out.  You will not be disappointed.Gluten Free Creations is amazing. It's a bakery that makes an enormous amount of gluten free pastries, breads, doughs, buns, etc. If you are allergic or intolerant to gluten, do yourself the favor and check them out. The gluten free bread at Sprouts supermarkets in AZ is supplied by Gluten Free Creations, which is very good. Also, the gluten free pizza dough for Picazzo's restaurants comes from this bakery. Most importantly, GF Creations sells gluten free breadcrumbs for turkey stuffing!!!!!! Make sure to get your order in early as I'm sure they're super busy around Thanksgiving and Christmas. Two years ago was my fiance's first Thanksgiving being gluten free and we figured he'd be royally screwed in the stuffing department. Lo and behold, Gluten Free Creations came to the rescue! They sell breadcrumbs just for the occasion! The stuffing came out so good that no one eating it (including wheat eaters) could tell it was gluten free! It's tucked away and can be hard to find. The front makes it look like a small operation but it's anything but tiny. Unfortunately most of the pastries have eggs or dairy in them so if you have multiple allergies, make sure you look at all the ingredients. Their hamburger buns aren't all that great, kind of like 2 lb. hockey pucks if ya know what I mean but I wouldn't hold that against them. Everything else has been amazing. The staff is very helpful and you just can't go wrong if you have a gluten allergy or intolerance.Wow... just wow.  This place is heaven for non-gluten eaters.  Up until about 30mins ago I was getting a little depressed over this whole cupcake craze.  Not anymore, I just ate one of the best cupcakes I have ever had and it was gluten-free and dairy-free!They have everything here:  cupcakes, cookies, pizza dough (they supply the gf dough to all the pizza joints in town that do gf pizza), pasta, hamburger buns, rolls, twinkies, cakes, pies, thanksgiving stuffing, bread crumbs to make your own stuffing, bagels, white bread, baguettes, I mean everything!  Oh, and it all tastes amazing.The location is a little hard to find the first time being behind a barber shop and, like all gluten-free products, is not very cheap, but if you avoid gluten and dairy, this place is a god send.  They are very knowledgeable about their products, make everything in house, and have their products listed by allergen.... so if you don't eat dairy, eggs, or nuts, or any combination, they have it all under an easy list.  They can also special make anything for you... birthday cakes, whatever.i have two words for you: herb baguette. I'm not a bread lover but this baguette doesn't need anything to taste good. Forget butter and don't bother dipping in olive oil. How is it possible that bread be so moist, dense, airy and flavorful all at the same time? I have no freakin' idea and that's why I have to buy from Gluten Free Creations, because there's no way I could replicate that. Okay okay I have no qualms with gluten. I don't really care what it is because it doesn't seem to affect me negatively, but why should only the celiac kids get the good stuff? And yes, I have tried to find this place twice before and failed (are gluten eaters stupid-er? possibly) but third times a charm when I stopped in this week. I'll admit it, I was looking for a cupcake. I think we all know about my cupcake addiction. GFC sells cupcakes in a 4-pack, which I can't support because that means I have to eat 4 cupcakes and I'm already killing myself at the gym for my one-at-a-time habit. But seriously, they had gluten free banana cupcakes! I was so sad they didn't have a spare to sell me...so sad I bought the mini herb baguettes and a brownie. The brownie was a two-person affair, a big frozen delight filled with thick chunks of chocolate. I couldn't tell the difference between it and a gluten-full brownie and that made me very happy. I think it may be time to start the "what makes a good brownie" debate; I feel like it will be a volatile one. I like them chewy with chunky bits. But the fluffy ones are nice too.  Truly though, the hero of the day was the herb baguette, which is a little smaller than a 6-inch sub, takes a long time to toast, but is worth the wait. I topped one of mine with farmer's cheese, roasted garlic and roasted red peppers. And I sat at the table crying because I knew each bite I took meant there was one less to take in the future. I love you Gluten Free Creations. I'm feeling smarter already.Recently I gots the allergic to wheats and the soy (teh suck!)Last week was my birthday and Michelle, my wife, bought a cake (and some other nifty creations) from these guys. I have had so many different "attempts" at gluten free stuff over the last couple years and let me tell you, most of it all tastes like CRAP!NOT THESE GUYS!!!I was so relieved biting into my chocolate cake, doughnuts, and bagels. Oh my gosh! It tastes good and pretty darn close to the original. I can't tell you how amazing it has been to have "good" baked goods again. Big props to GFC Bakery. I love you guys and I'll be back OFTEN!GFC is absolutely a heaven sent treat from above!For those of us with gluten intolerance, it is incredibly difficult to find bread, bagels, pizza dough, pastries, etc that do not have the fateful binding agent, but wonderful places like GFC save the day!They are located behind an auto oil changing shop (I think Midas) at 30th street and Thomas. They close at 5pm during the week, but if you call them and let them know you are on the way, they will wait around for you! Nice service!I'm vegan so I am limited with all the items I can try, but I can tell you the vegan gluten free chocolate chip cookies are amazing AND loved by regular eaters. I don't think Brad E could get enough!This time around I also discovered they have veggie burgers in buns! You can throw them in the microwave, but I put mine on the grill twice; both the buns and the patty. DELICIOUS!I love the onion bagels, especially with some vegan cream cheese! I also really enjoy the herb baguettes.Really cool news is that they just purchases Lulu's Cupcakes, so they will be opening in about a week (McDowell and Miller) with a small deli where they make sandwiches and they will have a retail area where you can get products from the bakery!Really really amazing place that I am incredibly thankful for!Oh, and if you live by Luci's (16th St and Bethany) they carry GFC items there too!I have been by this place several times now. Also now that I am far more aware of what I am eating, I pay attention.So today I went in. I found out this place has been here for 10 years.It is a bakery, as well as an Eat in or to go dinner.So much to choose from in here as well.Bread, cookies, bagels,Pizza dough,muffins, etc, etc, etc...I also really like that you can buy your own mixes on everything and make it your self if you so want to do it.Menu for meals is great and when you see all the food places they supply to you will be surprised as well.The even sell all types of cakes. You can order them form the book complete with decorations.It is not all too cheap in here. But, A little extra effort is worth the extra price ,I think.When we are all swelling up like Balloons changing your diet can do wonders.I will be happy to come back here. Yeah, for a great find!
Culver's=Two facts:Culvers trumps In N Out.Whoever compared Culvers to Dairy Queen is bonkers. they don't even compareI have been hearing this dumb commercial about 'being culverized' on KTAR and all I could think was how dumb it was that we were getting commercials for places we don't even have.ha, i was dumb. we do have a culvers!!! and i am now in love.reasons why it's better than In N Out:-while I love In N Outs meat patties, their cheese selection sucks. at culvers you pick your cheese- american, cheddar or swiss (i hate american cheese which is the only cheese offered at In N Out)- They have red onion, i love both onions but red is way better-I like their hamburger patties just a bit more than In N Outs(both are good)- Culvers shakes and custard are totallllllyyyyyy better than any milkshake In N Out could ever make.- I love all the options of burgers you can get at culvers! including bacon and if you dont want a burger their chicken strips look pretty awesome i am so excited i heard those dumb commercials and looked them up!!!!!!i will say that In N Outs fries are way better than culvers.  but that's it.When I first moved to Phoenix and then to the East Valley I was looking for new and different places to try.  I had never heard of Culver's.  I looked over their website and on one Saturday afternoon my daughter and I took a ride out this way.  We looked over the menu and I had one of their famous Butter Burgers.....Mushroom and Swiss, and my daughter had a grilled cheese.  The kids meals come with a one scoop sundae too, good deal.  Let me say that Butter Burgers are delicious!  I love them.  Their fries are good too but then I found cheese curds......OMG!  I am from California so I had never had these morsals of goodness before.  A Butter Burger, cheese curds and a root beer and I'm good.  But then the frozen custard.......YUM!!!  And a Concrete Mixer....wow!  And they run a special on pints to take home.  You can get 4 pints of custard for $8 and change!  Good deal!  They have a different flavor everyday.  Recently I had Pumpkin Pecan and it was delicious! The service is always fast and friendly.  I have never experienced anything but a smile here.  This location is about 10 miles from me and not far in the grand scheme of things.  I recently found out that they opened a new location closer to me!!  YAY!!  Forget those other fast food joints.  McDonald's pales in comparison.  Butter Burgers are fresh and soooo good.  And they have a variety of other choices.  They also offer fried chicken, fish and salads.  But note....this is NOT for someone on a diet.  This is where you splurge!  I love Culvers!!  Now if In and Out had frozen custard too I would be torn.
Raising Cane's=For those that read my last review on Rio buffet knows that I was in Vegas last week.  So while driving around town in Vegas I've passed by and noticed a huge "Cane's" sign.  Not sure what that was so the moment I got back to the room, I've decided to look them up.  There I realized that it's not "Cane's", but Raising Cane's Chicken Finger Restaurant.  So being a curious foodie that I am... I had to make a point to check them out before I'm heading back to good ol LA.My initial reaction... chicken finger restaurant?  What the?  I really got to go see it.  Upon my arrival (10:50am), There were like 3 people getting some food in front of me.  The location is right on Flamingo and near Maryland Pkwy which you can't miss, and it's super clean!  (Sorry for the sidetrack but I'll focus now!)So the interior was squeaky clean to me!  Perhaps it was early in the day but it definitely smelled really good, super clean, very pleasant.  So now I'm approaching the counter.The clerk was extremely courteous!  Very nice touch because I'm a sucker for service!  I told her that this is my first time here and that I'm from LA, and she gave me a good quick run down on the business history and what they offer...  I'm sure they were part of the procedure but nevertheless it's interesting to hear.Very simply menu... it's pretty much 3 pcs of chicken with toast, fries, cole slaw and sauce, the 4 pcs version, or the Caniac (6 pcs version which was their large combo)  Having people in my party I had to get the 6 pcs with 2 sauces...Here's how the food tasted...  Chicken finger was great!  Solid chicken pieces, freshly prepared, but to me it was slightly small that I would have liked for the price (which I'll get to in a minute).  Crinkle fries were pretty good... (I don't complain much about fries as they are my favorite, but I don't like steak fries too much because it's like eating an entire potato)  Cane sauce was decent, it was pretty much a hybrid of mayo based sauce mixed in with chili of some sort.. not too salty which is great with a little kick to it.  Texas toast was a thick piece of loaf with very little garlic butter on it, and the cole slaw was a cole slaw... nothing out of the ordinary and mediocre at it's best.  It also came with a drink though... (They got southern sweet tea which was pretty sweet!  LOL!) The total of my meal came out be just under $9... it's little steep for me but the experience was very positive.  Again the chicken tender pieces could of been either bigger, or they could have substituted for more pieces considering that we are paying $9 bucks, but I have to say the quality of the chicken was very good and will definitely visit them again in the near future when I go back to Vegas.So the history was about a guy writing a business plan on opening a chicken finger only restaurant, but was shot down by his professors, countless bankers, and eventually, worked hard a a day job and saved enough money so he can make his dream come true... Very inspiring if you ask me!  So maybe this review may not be as funny as others, but do remember that as long as you put your heart in doing what you love to do, work hard and not give up, you will eventually be rewarded!WHERE: Flamingo & Maryland Parkway (right by UNLV)WHY: I have a strong gut feeling that this may be the best Cane's location out of the Las Vegas chain! Haha.WHAT:  I have previously written a review about one of the other Cane's locations, but this is my absolute favorite location! The reasons behind my judgement is that the customer service is the best, the food is the best, and it stays 100 percent consistent!The handful of times I have come here, I have never been let down.  There are times when the fries are either too salty, too soggy, or too crispy. Or times when the chicken fingers just don't taste how they should be tasting. But! Never has any of these incidents happened to me here!! I just may be their number one fan and proud!The manager was an absolute sweetheart! I had forgotten my Caniac Club card, and he made it easy to accommodate me! There was one time I had forgotten my card at one of the other locations, and I couldn't redeem my box combo there! They had told me to email and or contact Cane's Corporate!! & sure did!In summation, before I go off rambling about how much I love this location, STOP BY, ORDER SOME TOAST & SWEET TEA, AND HAVE A MARRY DAY! =DA couple of friends who were celebrating their birthdays in Vegas over the weekend wanted to try Raising Cane's for lunch. There are multiple locations around Vegas, but this one was the closest to us and off-strip.I had no idea Raising Cane's was fast food and didn't know what to expect. The place was packed around 1:30 pm and we got into line, which moved quickly. They specialize in chicken fingers, so there aren't many options. I decided on The Box Combo, which included four chicken fingers, Texas toast, coleslaw, crinkle-cut fries their famous Cane's sauce, and a regular drink for $7. It was more than enough food for me and I couldn't finish the fries or slaw. The chicken tenders came in huge pieces and were super filling, although a bit dry on the inside but the yummy Cane's sauce helped with that.Service was awful. The cashier who rang me up was clueless, distracted, and rude. I asked her what was in the coleslaw and she straight up giggled and said, "I don't know." I just looked at her, thinking she'd ask a manager or provide some other response, but nope; all I got back was a blank stare. Okay... After that lovely exchange, she seemed completely disinterested in me and kept making googly eyes at this guy behind me, who I assume she personally knew, and basically had a side conversation with him while I was trying to order.Overall, Raising Cane's reminds me of another chain, Chicken Now, as they're pretty much on the same playing field. To be honest, I'd rather go to McDonald's (guilty pleasure) than come here again, but I wouldn't be opposed if friends wanted to come back. But before then, I'd like to try Strip 'N Dip Chicken Strips next time since I've had that bookmarked for awhile.
Yayo Taco=This place is so much fun and laid-back, I absolutely adore it. You feel like you're actually in another country for awhile. The decor totally sets the mood with the wooden benches and tables that have writing all over them. Very fun. But the food at a practical steal is why I always keep coming back here. During happy hour for UNLV/CSN students from 5-7 PM and 10-11 PM, you can get 4 classic tacos, 2 sides, and a can of soda for $5. Otherwise, this combo is $7.25 which is still a great deal because by the end of your meal they should guarantee that your button will pop off your pants or you get it free. I didn't even finish one of my tacos and I still felt like I wanted to die, but in a good way. I am getting full just thinking about it.I went with my boyfriend who also got the combo, his with meat and I went veg of course. I got three veggie tacos off of the classic menu, and then paid 50 cents extra for my last taco to be a Tofu Adobo taco. Unfortunately I can't tell you what was in the latter taco because I devoured it so damn fast. But the other veggie tacos are always made fresh and to perfection. Onion, peppers, zucchini with some crazy orange sauce that gives it a little kick. SO good. Unfortunately my sweet potato fries were a bit lacking on this visit, but the black beans with onion and garlic are always delicious. As I was perusing the menu with my honey, I noticed that they had something amazing at the bottom: homemade flan. I grew up on my grandfather's flan so I had to have it. Let's just say this wasn't my grandpa's flan. It had seeds on the top, and came with chips. Strange, but it was love at first bite. Order that with a Mexican Coke and you will have sugar rush like no other. You'll also probably want to throw up in the parking lot for the amount of food eaten, but I tell you it will be worth it. This place is very casual, the service is always good, and the food is beyond delicious. Of course sometimes the tacos are hit or miss, so I suggest to get 4 completely different ones with your meal and see which ones you like. But this place gets 5 stars because it's a comfortable experience at a great price, you get a ton of good (veg*n friendly!) food and hell - they recycle! Come in on a night when they have live bands playing and it is a total blast.Like approaching the gorgeous woman across the bar, only to learn she smells like body odor and Doritos.Like buying the vacation package that looked perfect online, just to find your "luxury cruise" is really a mattress on the floor of a fishing barge. Like buying a car off Craigslist, driving it 2 blocks and having all four wheels fall off.Such is Yayo Taco, looking mighty good up front and turning out to be something completely different in the end. Do you know how excited I was to hear they had a slew of vegetarian/vegan tacos? I guess no, you wouldn't know how excited I was so I'll tell you: SUPER FUCKING EXCITED. We went here on purpose a few miles from our hotel just to rock their veggie tacos. Multiple tofu options, from BBQ to veggie and tofu, different sauces... promising stuff. They looked amazing on paper and when they got in front of me on the plate I almost freaked out they looked so good. I was buzzed, 'tis Vegas after all, and when I saw that sexy plate'o'tacos I got ready to regulate. Booze and tacos man, best there is.So I took a bite. And another bite. One more bite just to confirm, and yea, totally boring. Waaaaay boring. Ultra-mega-super-compound-massive boring. Hopefully I made that clear enough, BORING. So I ate all three of my tacos, each one different, each one differently boring. Finding food boring when you're drunk is hard to do which makes me even more sad.Maybe the meat ones are the shit, I dunno, but I can 100% vouch that the vegan options are not. One extra star because the lady working the counter was sweet and also simply for having some vegetarian/vegan items in the first place. They were healthy and had very fresh ingredients, just a damn shame the tacos had no flavor. *sigh*I dig it. Cool little spot..often filled with UNLV students, and musicians of a sort. I stop in now and then for a few tacos and a few great beers.  They have  great beer selection. I'ma fan of the "Innes and Gunn Rum Cask Aged Beer" too sweet for some, great on my pallet with some spicy pastor tacos. I usually sit at the bar when grabbing a quick bite, but on a day off I'll chill at a table, grab a SEVEN and a WEEKLY and just relax for a bit. The owner is super chill, has a great attitude about things and likes what he does. It's super, extra casual as it's very close to UNLV. and it's got a dive feel to it, and that's all part of the charm. I spent a few years slumming around New Orleans and it brings me back to that. On that note, it actually reminds me of some of the more creative en devours I experience when in a town like New Orleans. So chill and go with the flow. With a price tag of about $1.75-$5.00 per person, it's a favorite spot for quick  and delicious grub. They have everything from carnitas style tacos to vegetarian options. YaYo taco doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. It's a taco joint with some flavor. I will go back again and again. Happy Eating!Based completely on the comment from this business to my *honest* review, I won't be coming back. The health department is around for a reason and, if this restaurant rejects their standards as too "institutionalized", I can't imagine wanting to give this place another chance. As I stated, if the violations were silly ones, like not having their letter grade displayed in the exact place specified by the health department, I'd overlook the grade. Unfortunately, this restaurant appears to proudly flout safe food-handling procedures and they're extraordinarily sanctimonious about it. Listen, Yayo Taco, I'm not in cahoots with "the Man". I just don't like food poisoning.
D'Arcy McGee's=What? They don't have air conditioning in Ireland? Agnes of God! It was hotter than the Blarney Stone on a hot humid June day. Plus we were tucked in away in an alcove, which was probably a cool table, I'm just not into big groups being smashed in a corner. What if I have to get out and pee? What if there's a fire? What if that mean leprachaun from that Jennifer Aniston movie comes in with a machete and starts hacking people? The Good: Server was very friendly and didn't mind being called babe, but don't call her sweetheart. I think gay guys can get a way with this. Hetero men, I'm not so sure. Smithwick on tap! My Irish eyes were smiling! Cute ass plaid skirts worn by cute as hell servers. The Bad: Potato skins....ummm...so basically it's a boiled potato with some weird cheese film wrapped around it, like gauze on a big toe. But it came with sour cream and chives and I could rub that all over my body and be happy.The Ugly. NEVER, did we receive silverware. Service was s l o w! Look we're not in Europe. We are not a leisurely people! Atmosphere was scattered and not really an Irish theme threaded throughout the large space. This one busboy chewing gum like a horse coming off ecstasy. Gross! I hate gum chewers! Especially when they are working. Etc...The Club sandwich was pretty good. Great 9 grain bread and a cranberry mayo but slim on the turkey and it had that weird processed texture and flavor.ABC was there citing the bartender for serving underage drinkers. Poor dude. It was an awkward moment for everyone. So Darcy McGee's I'd be back for a Smithwick. But my Lucky Charms ass will be sure to bring a small fan. And of course. My ID!Cheers!
Toqué=This place gave me a whole new perspective on molecular gastronomy. I'd had it before, but never executed quite this well. I was a little skeptical of all the great reviews, but this place lived up to its acclaim. This was one of the few Montreal restaurants on Open Table, so reservations were a snap. This is also one of the more elegant restaurants I've dined at in Montreal, so I'd recommend dressing up a bit. We got the 7 course tasting menu, along with the vintage wine pairing (there were two wine pairing options, vintage and regular). Amuse: Tangerine juice, served in a shot glass, topped with fir foam. First course: Scallop served in the shell, with apple foam & cranberry water. Wine pairing: 1998 macon late harvest chardonnaySecond course: Monkfish liver with sake gelée and organic soy sauce. Wine pairing: 1993 soaveThird course: Seared foie gras with chili jelly, groundcherry, daikon, apple water, sugar/salt on flower petal. Wine pairing: 1996 sauternes.Fourth course: Chicken topped with a sheet of homemade pasta with green onion oil. Wine pairing: 1996 Morgon beaujolais.Fifth course: Venison with elderberries, red pepper chips, garlic, root vegetables, brussels sprouts, Wine pairing: 1970 Rioja Faustino (bottled in 1974).Sixth course: Cheese plate with melted local cheese, homemade potato chips, pine nuts, red bell peppers, quince. (Wine pairing: didn't come with the tasting menu but we got a N.V. aged Tokai)Seventh course: Baked cored apple with apple sherbet, coconut/sour cream powder, cranberry reduction. Needless to say, it was a pretty impressive dinner. The colors and presentation of each dish were a work of art to behold, as well as to taste. The service was impeccable throughout the evening; the kind of service where your every need is anticipated. At one point a busser poured tap water into our sparkling water glasses, and even though it wasn't that big a deal our server immediately noticed and whisked those glasses away, bringing out a new bottle of sparkling water. Of all the meals we had on our last trip, this is one of the ones that was the most haunting; days later I'd still be thinking about some aspect of this meal. Montreal has so many excellent restaurants, so this is yet another one that is worth trying at least once.Wow! I called my dish - especially the appetizer, fireworks! It's an explosion of flavor and no two bites taste the same.We were thinking of looking for another place because of prices, but took the bullet and decided to stay... And were so happy we did!The bread was ok, but every other dish after that was a work of art with a beautiful melding of flavors that created music in my mouth.We were also worried that portions would be small, but after one course and one appetizer each we were stuffed.Only down side was that the duck was too salty for my taste. Everything else, was perfect.
Forefathers Gourmet Cheesesteaks & Fries=I am not happy with the co worker who introduced me to Forefathers.  Do I really need another way to feed my addiction to cheesy, beefy goodness?  Of course I do!This small restaurant in a Tempe strip mall has earned a special place in my heart.  No, not just because of the artery-strengthening cheese.  It is home to the best cheesesteak I have experienced since moving to AZ.While the menu offers a variety of choices other than cheesesteak sandwiches (chicken and even *gasp!* salads), I stick with what I know and love:Regular with Cheez Wiz ($7.35) - bring your appetite, because this sandwich is big!  A generous portion of thinly sliced meat and that oh so important Cheez Wiz is nestled within a soft bun.  It is gooey, drippy and messy.  Perfect.  If Wiz is not for you, it is also offered with white American cheese, Provolone or Mozzarella.  While I prefer mine with just the basic meat and cheese, you healthy types can also get any combination of 'OMG' - onions, mushrooms and green peppers.Fries are a very nice compliment to the sandwich.  Let's be honest here, fries are a very nice compliment to nearly anything.  Forefathers' fries ($2.55) are hot, salty and crisp.  If you haven't gotten your fill of Wiz on your sandwich, you can turn those fries into Cheese Fries ($2.95).  Either way, be sure to grab a container of 'fry sauce' (I am guessing this is some blend of ketchup and mayo).  One taste and you will want to put this on everything.  Lucky for me and my cholesterol level, this gem is nowhere near where I live.3.5 stars!  Came here on whim when this other cheesesteak spot we wanted to try out was closed for the day.  We had a long day of furniture shopping ahead of us and we needed to fill our tummies.  Enter Forefathers!The establishment itself is very clean and modern.  The staff was patient while we studied the menu and they seemed like a happy bunch.  I had ordered a regular cheesesteak  provolone and some plain crispy fries .  I almost regret not getting it with Cheez Whiz and OMG style but I figured I didn't need all that cheese filling me up and onions and peppers just didn't draw me in.  I did end up having to dump some fry sauce into my cheesesteak after the provolone got cold and it became a bit dry to eat.  I think this sandwich had great flavor and it's pretty hefty and filling.  The price is a bit steep but you do get a lot of meat [although not fresh].  It's a solid and decent cheesesteak.
Daphne's Greek Cafe=These far-reaching Gods of Cafetopolis you see, Whose minions such as Paneracles and Chipotle have erected from sea to sea,Desired like the vendors beyond the Acropolis offerings,Cafeteria dining serving Gyro and many such things,The fare was befitting of above mentioned ilk,Two stars at best though service was silk,The dolomades came hard the hummus was tasty,Spanakopita came fried as the cooks may be hasty,Falafel were shaped as tater-tots would,Pasty inside the two were not good,Salad lacked olives but for a dollop all ground,Feta was sparse with no pungency found,Drachmas went quickly when food was just ordered,Higher quality Greek food the price could have afforded(English majors...was that iambic pentameter?)
Heart Attack Grill=Are you kidding me?  Seriously.If you like less than mediocre food while porn is being thrown in your face, you'll find it here.  Seriously.We never would have gone in here if we had any idea.  Seriously.Corporate Suits in town wanted to take a few folks from my office to lunch and chose this place.  There's an hour of my life I'll never get back.  Seriously.This place makes Hooters look very upscale and classy.  Seriously.  And the food.  Huge burgers and fries are the only choices.  The burgers?  Think Encore Frozen Salisbury Steaks on a bun.  Seriously.We left with the unanimous agreement that none of us would ever see the inside of this place again.  Seriously.I walked in with my sister and my boyfriend.  We wanted to see a menu before sitting down.  We were greeted by someone in a way-too-tight nurse's costume.  Every single man in the place turned around and stared at us.  Every man in there sat alone at the counter with a beer.  I wondered if we had accidentally walked into a strip club, based on the layout, the customers, and the wait staff.  The little nurse politely but loudly told us the menu was painted on the wall.  Heart attack burgers, "flat line fries", unfiltered lucky strikes and buckets of beer.  That's it.  So we turned around and politely walked out as fast as we could.Wow!  Are there no reviews of this place, yet?  Okay, this is a funky, fun concept for a restaurant.  First of all I need to let you all know the food is great, although one might not want to eat it every day.  The menu fits on one business card, so the choices are simple. Nothing is diet at all, and the french fires are fired in lard.  BUT, the food is soooo good.  The concept is cute too.  The cooks are dressed as doctors, and the waitresses are dressed as nurses a la Tim Curry as he was dressed in the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  It sounds weird, but I recommend everyone who loves a great burger try the Heart Attack Grill in Phoenix.  Get thee there!  Yum!This place = Failtown, USA.My friends and I went in a while back to check out what all the hype was about this place.  Sure, it seemed like it was a Hooters knockoff (replace wings with burgers), but we had some hope that this establishment would be legit. WRONG.The waitress informs one of my buddy's that if he finishes some sort of monster glutton burger then the meal was on the house.  Well sometime later, after putting that entire burger away, we get the check and notice the burger was still on the check.  We bring it up with the waitress who beats around the bush.  We then ask for the manager, who was VERY non-compliant.  After the discussion turns into an argument (wow real professional on your part Heart Attack Grill), he threatens to "call the cops if we don't leave and we better or else he's going to jump over the counter and punch us in the face."SO MUCH FAILRegardless of whether the food was good or not (nothing spectacular), I am NEVER going back there again nor would I recommend anyone else to do so.  There's a Red Robin a mile west on Warner that has a full bar and burgers just as gluttonous with unlimited steak fries to boot.  If I could give this place 0 stars (along with AIDS, Herpes, Cancer, and a slow fiery death), I would.DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPEAhhh the infamous Heart Attack Grill. Listen, I am all for food that is bad for you. There is a place in this world for it, and I will defend that place in the world as I would defend my own country from invasion. However, when food is not good for you, it better taste good. This is the failure of the Heart Attack Grill. -When a burger is 8000,6000,4000, or 2000 calories, it better be in the top 10 of all time burgers. This is more like the bottom 10. The burgers here are SOOOOOO GREASY. If I went back I'd ask them for some burger with my grease. Now let me say, I'm not that guy who wipes off his greasy food with a napkin and THEN eats. When I seek out grease, bring it on. But the burger is so thoroughly and completely greased inside and out that there is no burger taste. Pure disappointment. -The fries, cooked in pure lard, were actually excellent. I almost gave this place 2 stars for that, but then I realized this is actually why I am giving it 1 star. -I do like the coke bottled in Mexico with actual sugar, not corn syrup or whatever the hell we use here. That was a plus. -I don't smoke, so I did not partake of the unfiltered lucky strike lung darts. -The wait staff. Wow, they aren't wearing much. We had a cute waitress, who would sit on the counter, and my sister realized that more of her butt was in contact with the counter than not. She was playing the role well. Flirty, dingy. There were some other waitresses that were probably 20 years her elder. I will not comment further for fear it may incriminate me. -The atmosphere.....White and Red, like In N Out or 5 Guys Burgers. Wheelchairs for people who eat triple or quadruple bypasses. What no Lipitor? I would bet money that the scary dude who sat next to us ogling the cute waitress for an hour was registered in the state as a sex offender, or at least on some FBI watch-list. I will leave you with the following thought as you ponder my lack of recommendation for The Heart Attack Grill. Someone said this place makes Hooters look classy. ACTUALLY this place makes the Crazy Horse Too in Las Vegas look classy.One of the WORST experiences of my life.  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought, "hey wow, this is kinda cool" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had "cottage cheese" legs and thighs.  We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us "you either pay or i come over the counter" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways, don't go here.  Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard, are crap.  All in all, if you're a lonely loser, this is the place for you.  If you're a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food, go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied.I went to Heart Attack Grill after seeing it in the national nursing media headlines (they were putting this place down for creating a demeaning/sexualized view of nurses). So, of course, I had to go and see what the fuss was about. I walked in to the very small location, to find only 2 other tables with customers (older, unhygienic, obese men). The two waitresses on staff were less than appealing (and I'm the kind of girl that can look at an attractive woman and admit it) and the "cook" behind the counter, in the scrubs/doctor uniform looked like his clothes and hair hadn't been washed in more than a week. Went ahead and ordered anyways. Their menu consists of 4 burgers (single, double, tripple, or quadruple bypass bugers), flatliner fries, and soda... but no diet soda. Oh, you can also order a pack of Camel filterless cigarettes if your stash is running low. I ordered a single bypass burger, flatliner fries, and a coke. The burger was sub-par... very greasy and the fries were soggy and half cooked. The only positive thing I have to say is that I enjoyed drinking a Coke out of a cold glass bottle. I'd rather go to Hooters to see hot, half-dressed chicks... and I'd rather go ummmmm... ANYWHERE else to eat.There are quite a few unique things about this place, drinks are bottled water, bottled coke, Corona or Bud (there is no tap water as they have no glasses). There are really only two things on the menu, a burger (either Single, Double, Triple or Quadruple Bypass) with or without cheese and an endless order or fries. They had a toppings bar with pickles, jalapenos, tomatoes and onions but no lettuce (it's considered health food). There is mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup and vinegar but no hot sauce.For $499 you can get a membership and can eat 3 meals a day every day of the year if you'd like. Another schitck they have is if you weigh in excess of 350 lbs your meal is on the house (you can eat there 3 times a day if you please). And there is currently an eating challenge for an individual to complete a Quadruple Bypass in a single sitting but I don't think you receive anything. They have the fasted time at around 2:30 minutes currently.I ordered a Single Bypass with cheese and the french fries. The fries were tasty but not nearly as crispy as I'd like. They were quite limp which actually made it somewhat hard to dip them in the ketchup. They were extremely fresh though, they cut and make them almost non-stop throughout the day. However they are fried in lard and are extremely greasy.The burger was good but certainly nothing I couldn't whip up at home. Mine was slightly undercooked for my liking but not enough to have them recook it. They use a 70/30 beef to fat patty, which for me is too much. On top of that they add pork fat while cooking and dip the buns in  pork fat as well. As you can tell they're very much into excess here. For all the added calories there is not sufficient added taste.The whole thing is over-the-top and cheesy but I guess you can say you come here for the experience more than anything and for that it's more than worth the $10 and the food is at least acceptable. It's really more of a show than anything else. I was hoping to get to see someone attempt the Quadruple Bypass but sadly I didn't get to witness one. It's somewhat strange but families, with young children, tend to eat here a lot too. I don't know how I'd feel about bringing my kids here, not quite the right place. The staff and the crowd was quite enjoyable. I'd eat here occasionally if I lived near by, if only for a good time.I have photos and a more in depth review on my personal blog.And now ladies and gentlemen... the single worst establishment I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. Heart Attack Grill has ZERO redeeming qualities. There is not a single reason for me to even get close to giving this place anything more than one star. This is one place that makes me wish Yelp would allow a zero or negative star rating. Now, to preface this review... I'm not an idiot... I know that this place is "The Heart Attack Grill" so I went in prepared for greasy and unhealthy food but hoped it'd be fun and even though unhealthy, maybe taste alright. Whoa, was I ever wrong to hope for that. They group their burgers by how many patties there are... starting out with the Single Bypass burger (one pattie) and going up to the Quadruple Bypass burger (four patties). Being a little more on the conservative end, I went with the Single Bypass burger and a side order of fries. My Dad came along for the fun and he got the same... for the purposes of this review I should tell you that my Dad is a machine, he can eat... and he doesn't mind a little grease. Right as they bring our food out, I immediately get intimidated. The patty of the burger was dripping with fat and the meat used was such low quality (extremely high fat/meat ratio) that the patty didn't even appear to be beef... it had this whitish tint to it that you'd have to see to believe. I've never seen such an unhealthy piece of beef in my life... it doesn't help that they cook it in pure lard either. This was beyond unhealthy, it was disgusting. I feel like if you're making something blatantly unhealthy there should at least be a method to the madness; there should be some attempt at wanting to make it actually taste good (it is food by the way). It just seemed like they were pushing the grease and lard to the absolute maximum just to see how far they can take it. Well I'm not impressed... I took one bite and was instantly grossed out, I actually almost threw up it was so bad. My Dad who can hang with the best of 'em was able to stomach about three bites until he could no longer continue. The second we left the place I turned to my Dad and said "that's the worst single piece of food I've ever put in my mouth". I'm not exaggerating when I say that I'd rather eat a dried up piece of dog shit between two buns than a Heart Attack Grill burger. The only thing worse than the food is the tacky and over the top waitresses. They wander around in little nurses outfits often times with their underwear quite visible, and their whole bar area has a slanted mirror to actually encourage you to look up their skirts. That'd be fine and all, except I didn't want to look up these skirts. If you're going to have your wait staff dress sexy, you better make sure they're worth looking at in the first place. These girls were a little rough around the edges... most of them had that 'ex-stripper' look; and I could have sworn that one of them had bullet wounds on her stomach... that's not a joke.P.S. I actually dry heaved while writing this review just thinking about my fat drenched burger. DO NOT GO HERE.Great idea, but fail execution.Well... I don't know about great, but it is certainly an interesting idea. Almost clever. Going here was my friend's idea - it was either this or get that gastronomical abomination from KFC where they give you a bacon and cheese sandwich and then replace the bread with deep fat fried chicken. I don't like KFC, so I went with this. My choices might as well have been a kick in the face or a stomp on the nuts.I didn't know what to expect. We walk past the ambulance into the restaurant. The air was thick inside. Oily. I quickly notice that everyone is wearing hospital gowns while devouring their meals. If peopleofwalmart.com was a movie - this would be the cast. We found ourselves seats and were greeted by a sweet young girl who put a hospital wristband on us and then came around to put on our gowns. The place is staffed with cute girls in nurse costumes. I look down at the menu and the choices are called bypass - the severity varied by how many slabs of meat they put on. It was all kind of fun at first.I ordered the lightest thing on the menu - a single 1/2 pound burger - also an order of fries (which are unlimited refills) and a water... outside of water, my choices are sugar drinks or beer. My friend ordered a Double Bypass which was a pound of meat, also fries and also beer. The fries were cooked in lard - they didn't taste too bad, but were not crispy or special at all. They just weren't worth getting up for seconds. Soggy, floppy and flavorless... just something to deliver salt to my stomach.The burger arrived in a paper tray looking like a sad heap of grease. The bun was glistening - soaked with grease. Butter? Lard? Motor oil? I couldn't be sure, but the first bite told me I didn't want a second. I peeled the top bun from the burger and plopped it in the tray. I attempted to take another bite or two, but couldn't take it. The meat was sub-par shitty, fatty grocery store beef. The cheese was cheap tasting as well. Not that I expected wine and caviar, but for food this cheap and shit tasting, I wouldn't expect to pay so much. I didn't eat more than a few bites of the burger and I didn't touch the fries much, but I still felt both full and hungry at the same time. I pretty much just ate a few pickle slices and drank a bottle of water. The waitress asked how I liked it - my friend loved it and said he would've had seconds. I said it was terrible and that I was dissatisfied. I didn't ask for any money off the bill and she didn't offer it either. Even though I didn't eat it, she charged me 12 bucks or whatever it was. I wasn't entitled to not having to pay or anything - I mean, I ordered it. I should've known what I was getting into. Still, many restaurants would've bent over backwards to make me happy. I can't really bust them down a star for this, but even if I could there's no option for negative stars. Heart Attack Grill served me one of the worst burgers I've ever had. The novelty of it wore off as soon as my food arrived. If you want to eat an unhealthy yet savory burger/fries meal - go to in'n'out burger.I will never eat here again. I like greasy food sometimes, but I would rather eat a stick of butter and wash it down with bacon grease. Seriously - fuck this place. Then again... my friend loved it, so you never know.I travel with a competitive speech team. We were recently in Arizona for a competition, and my team HAD to stop at the Heart Attack Grill- a member of my team is doing a speech about it, we couldn't get away without seeing the place firsthand!Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted by a smell that can accurately be described as "Fat, grease, and charred death." You know the smell that sometimes comes out of a burger restaurant- the slightly-singed, but otherwise-delicious smell of meat being grilled? This was a sick amplification of that. The smell alone was enough to drive several members of our party to pursue other options for dinner.As far as decor, the restaurant does a good job of sticking to an anti-doctor theme, with signs plastered all over the restaurant warning you of the unhealthy nature of their food, mandatory patient gowns for all diners, and waitresses dressed as cute nurses. But the food itself could be summed up with the word "Sickening," which actually works metaphorically and literally. Their shakes are incredibly sweet, but actually filled with ice cream, pure cream, and butter. Their fries are cooked in lard, and their burgers are excessively heavy and fattening. A burger and fries is really enough to fill up a fully-grown man, but the sensation of being completely filled by lard, meat, and grease is almost as disgusting as seeing one of the obese regulars scarf down a triple-bypass burger for free.The next morning, most of us who'd eaten there were still full. One of my friends said he "felt like [he] just blew the Hamburglar." Starting with the smell, and lasting all the way to the aftertaste the next morning, this anti-hospital is as novel as it is grotesque and excessive. I seriously almost threw up twice before I even tried anything, but I like to exercise and eat healthy. Other people didn't seem as disturbed by the place as I did, and to HG's credit, the things they serve actually maintain a stronger semblance to edible food than some other places I've eaten. It will definitely fill you up, and the theme is kind of cute.Nonetheless, I can't walk away from a restaurant feeling like I just destroyed my body and recommend it. I almost feel like the place is unethical for its  choice to give such flagrantly unhealthy meals. At the same time, the place is called HEART ATTACK Grill, and they don't make any effort to pretend they're doing anything other than providing the most unhealthy and disgusting food possible. With that, and the friendly service in mind, I can't justify any rating lower than 2/5. I'd definitely like this place more if they just used fresh ingredients, didn't cover everything in nastiness, and just stuck to making good burgers, fries, and shakes...but I realized that would just make them In-N-Out, and would kind of ruin everything this restaurant stands for.Disgusting? Yes.Necessary? No.Immoral? Decidedly no, since they clearly warn you about what you're getting in to.I'd eat here once, and NEVER again. It's a place fueled by novelty- go there only if you're inspired after watching Epic Meal Time on youtube.I will just be straight upfront; are they unhealthy, yes!! Is the fries cooked in pure lard, yes! Is the coke made from real sugar, yes!But you know what, even though this place is unhealthy it is defiantly a place to experience once in your life time. Where else can you go where waitresses dress up like nurses and serve you food, or doctors as cooks? A place where you have to where a hospital gown and a wrist band and there is no exceptions? Their really isn't any other place like this.It is true though it is really bad for you it sure does taste good! So if your in need of a good burger and fries and an experience to go with it this is the place to go!I am a sucker for a theme restaurant. I have been wanting to visit this place for a while because of their whole gimmick. When you arrive a nurse checks you in, gives you a hospital wrist band, and dresses you in a hospital gown. Seriously, I love a gimmick more than the next person but the Heart Attack Grill is 100% gimmick and only 60% good food. The menu consists of burgers which vary only in the number of patties, french fries fried in lard, shakes, pure sugar coke, and PBR. They have a strict no sharing policy which completely bummed us out because we wanted to order the huge 20 patty burger and split it 3 ways. We ordered 2 single bypass burgers (one of our trio boycotted the burger because of the no sharing policy,) all you can eat lard fries, a vanilla shake, full sugar coke and a PBR. The burgers were ordinary, the fries were ordinary, and the service (aside from being dressed as naughty nurses) was ordinary. The only win was the delicious butterfat filled vanilla shake. The bill came to around $30, which is a bit pricey because remember only two of us actually had food. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. It is a gimmick. Heart attack, fat, lard, waitresses dressed as nurses, cook dressed as doctors, sugar, beer...whatever. It gets old pretty fast.
CUT=WOW this place is awesome! i came here for an anniversary dinner with the bf on a wed night. we had reservations at 7pm, but even though we got there early, we were still seated right away in a cozy little booth. the decor is modern with lots of browns and dimmed lights and the vibe just felt cool haha...we were probably the youngest diners in the restaurant but for a wednesday night, the place was pretty packed.our server, Carlos was attentive, efficient, and super friendly. he was able to describe the meats and wines to us and offered great recommendations. after much deliberation, we skipped the starters (since they do give you a good amount of bread) and went straight for the meat! i opted for the American Wagyu Filet ($80) and it was delicious! it was cooked perfectly medium rare and yes it was 'charred', but nothing extreme and the meat didn't taste burnt or anything like that. lots of yelpers complained about the saltiness of the meat, but i thought the seasoning was just right...in fact, they served my steak with a side of extra salt just in case i needed more haha. our side dishes of wild field mushrooms and yukon potato puree were just right to compliment the steak. in addition to the awesome food, the service was impeccable, our wine and water glasses were always filled and i swear just as we had finished up our meal, our plates were cleared in an instant. we were checked up on and i never felt like i was rushed. another plus was our complementary dessert. the words "happy anniversary" were spelled out in chocolate and served alongside 4 different crackers/cookies...it was quite a pleasant surprise since i wasnt expecting anything like that. overall this was a sensational dining experience! everything was spot on and i'll definitely have to save my money for my next visit to CUT hahaPros: Taste of New York Sirloin (the Japanese Wagyu 2 oz. specifically), cool decor, really nice server named CarlosCons: None?I went here with Kristin C. for our 2 year anniversary dinner last week and I was definitely impressed. The decor was really nice in here.  It had a modern feel. The lights were dimmed which created a very relaxing and intimate setting. Perfect for a romantic dinner. We got a nice booth and a really attentive server named Carlos.Decor is nice and all, but we all know the food is really what matters.  After we ordered, another waiter came around with a platter of different breads. I got one wheat bread and one pretzel type bread. Apparently, the pretzel bread is their specialty. I could definitely see why. It was soft and delicious.For my main course, I ordered the "A Tasting of New York Sirloin" ($140). It comes with different types of New York sirloin:- Japanese Wagyu From Saga Prefecture 2 Oz- American "Kobe Style" From Snake River Farms 4 Oz- U.S.D.A. PRIME Dry Age From Nebraska 4 OzAll 3 steaks were really tasty. Definitely, some of the best steaks I've had in my life. However, the best out of the 3 was definitely the Japanese Wagyu. So freaking good. It was nice and tender. My steak knife cut through it like butter. I can see why they only give 2 oz. too. Two reasons: 1) its the pricest per ounce and 2) I think since it's sooo rich and tender, if you get too much, it might be too much of a good thing.We also got potato puree and mushrooms as sides and they were good too. But seriously, the steaks made my night.  Hanging out with Kristin C. was cool too I guess :)Overall, this place is great for special occasions. I might just have to go to CUT in LA just to get my Japanese Wagyu fix.This place is ... interesting. You're seated on fancy, swiveling conference room chairs inside a really swank space (Vegas restaurants kick LA restaurants' asses in this respect). Maybe Wolfgang thought the restaurant was too pretty for a steakhouse and decided to add more manliness to the establishment by hiring a wait staff completely devoid of uteruses. These men in black are awesome, though, and the service is what you'd expect for a meal that costs as much as an Ikea sofa.Meal-wise this place is all about the Wagyu, Japanese or American. If you don't get this looking at the menu, they hammer the point home by carrying an armload of Wagyu to your table, so they can dazzle you with the marbling. I've had Japanese Wagyu in both Japan and the States, and while I've come close to weeping with joy several of those times, I didn't feel compelled to shell out $160 for an 8oz rib eye. So I went with a 20 oz bone in rib eye from Illinois, much to the chagrin of our waiter. The girlfriend got an American Wagyu sirloin. My rib eye was decent, but not great (Damn you, Illinois!). The American Wagyu, however, was awesome. The appetizers were okay, but the side dishes were amazing. I found it annoying that they charged for sauces. They bring you an assortment of sauces for free anyway. Can't tell you about dessert, because we were so stuffed that even an extra molecule of soufflé would've given me a hernia.One of the best steakhouses in Vegas.  One of the few to serve Japanese Kobe beef.Only had the privilege of trying this place twice in the past six months.  No reservations either time (we just walked in after a successful day of poker at the Venetian.)  No problems.Service was outstanding (although we are biased since we knew some of the servers).The ambiance is very modern yet comfortable.  You know you are in a new American steakhouse.The appetizers were very good but not memorable.  This is because the steaks are the focus of this restaurant.  Servers will come to your table and show you the different cuts and grades of beef before you place your order.  I was ready to eat the steak raw at that moment.  Strongly recommend the American Kobe.  This cut is not as rich as the Japanese Kobe but based on the portion size, no one can finish the Japanese Kobe.  Prime steaks are OK but common, you can get that in your home town. As always, we skipped the sides.  The focus in on the steaks.One note, be careful with the amount of bread you consume.  It's easy to fill up before you even get to the steaks.  The soft pretzel is outstanding and the breadsticks are so crisp that I showered my guest twice with crumbs; sorry.The wine list is well chosen and includes many of the trendiest boutique wines from the new world.  Watch out, you can easily overspend.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.This seems to be one Wolfgang restaurant that isn't suffering from the Celebrity Chef Syndrome. You know... that ailment that seems to affect many restaurants on the Strip. The one where a celebrity chef opens an outpost in Sin City only to neglect it and have the quality of the product suffer as a result. As an example see Spago and Postrio or other celeb restaurants like Mesa Grill. Cut bucks the trend successfully by offering some amazing steaks and fabulous accompaniments.While I didn't think the cheese ball amuse bouche was anything special, the bread selection was very good. Particularly good were the pretzel bread and focaccia. The fresh burrata (with prosciutto, raisin-rhubarb compote, and arugula) wasn't something that was very memorable. The cold, stringy consistency of the cheese wasn't appetizing and the subtle flavor made the dish forgettable. The maple glazed pork belly, however, was an unbelievable mix of sweet and savory flavors. It could have benefitted from a little more pork fat to add to the texture and taste, but overall it was one of the best pork dishes i've had in a while.For our entrees we had an 8 oz. petit cut filet and the 16 oz Nebraska corn fed rib eye. We ordered some wild field mushrooms with the filet and got a side of fingerling potatoes to share. We ordered both medium rare but the filet came out closer to medium. They were both beautifully charred, providing a flavorful crust to the steaks while keeping the centers juicy and tender. Service was solid, although our waiter did disappear for a few stretches. However, the guy refilling our water was always around. It seemed like after every sip of water he was there to fill it back up to the top.The decor is hip, trendy, and modern. Quite a contrast to most other steak houses in Las Vegas. The music was more safe and mainstream, as they played a lot of U2, the Beatles, Rolling Stones, and Cold Play.They give locals a 20% discount off of food, so if you are Nevada resident make sure you ask about it when you order.4.5 StarsMy friend wanted to have one really nice dinner for his Vegas bday weekend.  We all love steak, so we decided to make reservations at CUT.  I had just dined at Alexander's( http://www.yelp.com/biz/alexanders-steakhouse-cupertino#hrid:zgOk0ixxx8Fog1FdFDMgKA/src:self ) a few weeks prior and LOVED it, so I had super high expectations for CUT.  We had a party of eight, so we called in for reservations ahead of time. Service here is definitely outstanding.  There were so many servers waiting on us, I couldn't keep track.  Our water glasses were always full, and your napkin would always be folded if you got out of your seat.  Our waiter brought out a platter to display the different cuts of wagyu beef....Kobe vs. American...so we could see the different marbling.    For my first course, I ordered the Roasted Baby Beets, Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese, Pistachio, Citrus, Micro Basil,  & Mint.  I originally was going to get the USDA Prime bone in rib eye steak, but it was only $20 more for the American Wagyu rib eye....I was sold.  I added the wild field mushrooms to top off my lovely piece of steak.  Our table also ordered Sautéed Baby Spinach, Soft Polenta with Parmesan and Tempura Onion Rings.My beet appetizer had a very nice presentation.  It was very colorful, and all of the ingredients complimented each other very well.  All of our sides were very tasty.  The polenta was nice and creamy, onion rings were crispy, and the spinach added the "healthy" factor to our meal.They prepare the steaks over a hard wood and charcoal grill and then finish them off in a broiler.  My steak was cooked to a nice medium rare, and it melted in my mouth.  The steak had great flavor, but I didn't really care much for the charred flavor from the broiler.  The wild mushrooms I added went well with my steak and kept it moist from the sauce.  I wasn't able to finish my steak and gave it to my friends who had the USDA Prime rib eye.  They were amazed and could totally tell the difference from the Wagyu.The only disappointment I had here was that they didn't have foie gras as an add on to your steak.  I was spoiled by Alexander's, and left the restaurant craving that melt in your mouth foie gras.  I was so expecting a 5 star dinner here, but I just couldn't give it to them.  Please add foie gras to the menu!Nothing says love like red wine and redder meat.  Wow. 3rd most expensive dinner we've had in LV with Nobu and Picasso at 1 and 2. Decided this would be a nice splurge for our 3 year wedding anniversary and it certainly was. I was glad I read a bunch of Yelpers reviews before going as it made it MUCH easier to choose what to get and all that. We went with a 9pm rez after seeing Phantom. Both of us had intentionally skipped lunch in anticipation and I even went to the gym 3 days in a row haha. The atmosphere was pretty loud. Not exactly the most romantic place but no big deal. The vibe was more fitting for the HRH all-suites tower than Palazzo. Got a booth instead of the stupid swivel chairs thank god. Wife started with the kobe beef sashimi which was awesome. Pretty much the best carpaccio ever. I could've just eaten the beef sushi-style. I got the big eye tuna tartare after reading everyone's recommendation and it certainly did not disappoint. After reading SO many raves about it..I went with the 10 oz American Kobe ribeye. Wow! You gotta love the marbled, fattiness of the beef. My wife got the regular filet which was also excellent and the difference in how both meats tasted was really interesting. We could only manage to eat half of our steaks but I'm SO looking forward to the leftovers today!!  The price of the mac and cheese was ridiculous. I was looking for an asterisk on the menu that said it came with a foot massage or something...tasted awesome anyways. Also went with the broccoli rapini for the other side. Went well with everything. Skipped the sauces and didn't miss them. FYI..they don't do a locals discount anymore. Whatever..no one comes here to save money. We've been to so many steakhouses in LV....I can't say it was the best one we've been to but it was really great.Two years and 15 more visits since my last review proves in my mind that Cut is the Pantheon of steak.  The Kobe steak sashimi with spicy radish garnish is a perfect way to sample the high quality of the beef.  The fat literally melts in your mouth.  Their take on a steak tartare with herb aioli is equally good.  A modern redo of a classic.  Finally, the bone marrow flan is to die for.  (I really like the veal tongue but don't want animal activist to think I'm heartless).Now the beef.  This is a true steak lovers paradise.  All of the steaks are beautifully aged, trimmed.  All are prime and above.  All steaks are at least partially grilled over charcoal for the perfect bitterness.  The steaks:-  Illinois corn fed aged 21 days - Good beef flavor.  Bone in cuts are better.- Nebraska corn fed 35 days - Deep beef flavor. Very nutty.  Strong umame.  Not for everyone but outstanding if you like very good aged beef.  The rib eye is the top pick.-  American wagyu - Truly outstanding.  Tender and buttery.  The cuts are small but with the incredible richness, more than enough food.  Do not order this beyond medium rare or it dries up and is a waste.  The rib eye is the most flavorful cut.- Australian wagyu - Wow. Nuff said.First time visitors should try the tasting of new york sirloin.  It offers an outstanding selection and gives the opportunity to try different super grades of beef.Finally, the braised short ribs deserve special mention.  If you want something different, this is it.  It is Indian spiced so a bit different but absolutely fall of the bone tender.I have never tried their sauces, toppings, or sides.  Naked steaks are best to me.The wine list remains extensive.  Prices are good.To those wanting the absolute best in beef, Cut is without a doubt it.After my outstanding experience here, it goes without saying that Wolfgang Puck's take on steaks is a "cut" above the rest!Tucked inside the Palazzo resort, Cut exhibited a refined contemporary appeal and warmth that was both inviting and comforting.  I especially enjoyed the service by Tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. After allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and I must say, they all looked enticing! Shortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads I've come across. Parmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of Parmesan breading on the outside.Bone Marrow Appetizer - From the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. Simply unbelievable. If there's one single dish from this entire trip, I will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!Steak Tasting American Kobe Style from snake river - paired with a house steak sauce. The beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. The tangy flavor of the steak sauce was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. Let it be known, I'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!USDA prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the New York, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. Honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. Australian wagyu from Blackmore -Worthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. It's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. The best steak I've ever had. It came with a béarnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. It was perfect all on its own.White corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish DessertBaked Alaska - Tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. Btw, that's a good thing!  It also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!Banana Creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. Now that's what I call a triple chocolate threat! Having said that, It was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which I really enjoyed.Before we left, Tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! Service was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. But i'd have to say Tara made all the difference! She transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!Bravo to CUT for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! You bet ill be back for an encore! Until then...Happy Eats!Cut remains one of the top steakhouses in Vegas.  Why the update?  The return of real Japanese beef to the menu.Excess Foodie Trivia:  Japanese Wagyu beef varies in quality and flavor depending on sub species, rearing, and environment.  There are dozens of Wagyu "brands", the top being Matsusaka Ushi (virgin females fed rice and beer, massaged daily producing extremely deep even marbling, whose fat is the only one that melts at human body temperature).  Kobe with its rice like aroma and Omi with its viscous fat round out the top three.  Regardless of brand and ranking in Japan, all are far beyond the quality of the best USDA Prime.Back to Cut. Outstanding starters are modified seasonally.  I'm longing for Autumns return and the incredible carpaccio with celery hearts, truffle hollandaise and shaved white Alba truffles.  Perhaps the perfect version of a carpaccio, white truffles enhance the sweet, mineral beef flavor and the otherworldly white truffle hollandaise it's richness all surrounded by an umame fog of aromas.  The bone marrow flan is extremely rich, it's flavor sweetened by an earthy mushroom marmalade and brightened by an herbaceous, green parsley salad.   Excellent.To the beef.  All grilled over hardwood for a gentle smoked flavor and finished under a broiler.  Well seared, very evenly cooked, always to temperature.In general, bone in USDA prime cuts are gently aged deriving their beefy flavor from the bone.  Hearty beefy texture and deep beef flavor.  The boneless cuts have more aging and a nuttier, more pronounced umame goodness.  Slightly greasy, mouth feel and lingering flavor.  Very high quality AMERICAN steaks.  The American wagyu, very tender, sweet, mild beef flavor.  Extremely rich whose fat leaves a slight cloying mouth feel..Finally,  Japanese wagyu from Saga prefecture.  A4 quality.  Deep, even marbling.  Very sweet with a good beef flavor.  Extremely rich.  Very smooth mouth feel, the fat is not cloying having the viscosity of wine, not olive oil. Excellent.Many return visits, still no desert.Service remains Steakhouse refined and efficient.  The wine list remains excellent.Prices match the quality but hey, it's Vegas, all it takes is one spin.Oh Cut, I so wanted to love you! But unfortunately, I just like you. 3.5 stars.One of our friends had said this is his favorite steakhouse and he eats here every time he goes to Vegas. So for our annual Thanksgiving dinner, I suggested Cut as the place for my family to dine. We all walked away saying we would not come here again.Service - Top notch!Ambiance - This is a tiny restaurant and it's decorated nicely, but the music was classic rock and didn't really fit the feel of this place.The food - Hits and misses, which i'll get to.Price - About $1000 for eight people, which is pretty average for a steakhouse.Bread - You are given crispy breadsticks coated in parmesan. Tasty, but very messy, the parmesan flaked off all over the place. You are brought a plate of four choices of bread, you tell them which ones you want, and they are served to you by a waiter. I had the pretzel bread and the onion focaccia bread. Both were awesome. Starters - They don't have soup! I really wanted a soup, but there are none on the menu. Bummer. My friend ordered the Butter Lettuce, Avocado, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Champagne-Herb Vinaigrette Salad. I had a couple bites and it was very good. Steak - Our friend had told us to splurge and get the Japanese Wagyu Ribeye. It's $155 for 8 oz. He said it was well worth it, so BF and I split it. Japanese Wagyu is apparently not for me, it's just too buttery and literally melted in my mouth. I like steak I can chew on a little bit. I don't fault Cut, I just think it isn't my thing. My friend ordered a Petite Filet with Blue Cheese and I tried it, I liked his filet a lot and wish we had ordered that instead. Everybody else said their meat was okay.Sides - Brussels Sprouts - great flavor, but too undercooked for my taste. Not served very hot. Creamed Spinach topped with Fried Eggs - Just okay, also not very hot, and I could have done without the egg. Mac & Cheese - Good flavor, but the noodles were slightly gummy and also, this wasn't hot. Dessert - We didn't get any, but my friend ordered the Chocolate Souffle and it was amazing. Definitely the best part of the meal. It wasn't terrible, but there are so many steakhouses in Vegas, many of which I think are a lot better. When you are dropping $125 a person, you want to enjoy everything you eat, and that didn't happen here.man, pretty disappointedI had originally booked Delmonico's for D's bday dinnerbut at the last minute switched to CUT after I noticed that CUT had a wider variety of options to choose fromthe interior of the space was beautiful(ooh, we did see swizz beats and his posse there. but eh,not much of a fan after the AK/SB drama)the service was friendly but spotty and really slowwe ordered:20 oz bone in rib-eyedouble thick kurobuta pork chopwith a side of roasted brussels sproutsa glass of malbecand a glass of nikka whiskeyD loved his steak said it was the best he'd ever hadthe pork chop was good at initial bitebut lost its luster quicklythe brussels sprouts were average they brought out a carrot cake for D's birthdaywe both took one bite and put our forks downno buenoconsidering the reputation WGP hasI expected more unfortunately, my expectations weren't metglad D enjoyed his steakbut made me wish I kept my reservations at Delmonico'sIf you are steak lover and visiting Las Vegas you must give this place a try. I had the honor of dining here with several friends. Wow! What more can you ask for as a steak lover. I have to say you are going to be paying a lot for your meat. It's worth it all the way. I used to be big fan of Mastor's until I came here. Hands down the best steak money can buy.If you are a person who loves great meat and outstanding dishes. What more can you ask for as a steak lover.  It's worth it all the way. I used to be big fan of Mastor's until I came here. If you are from NY and love Keens Steakhouse in Manhattan then you need to long no place else.I highly recommend the bone in filet to the 8 ounce Kobe steak. If you are looking for great starters I would get pink Fiji peach salad or the butter lettuce. For side dished I would highly creamed spinach and roasted Brussels sprouts. Leave room for desert. The banana cream pie or the baked Alaska pear.Service 10+Quality 10+The creme de la creme of steakhouses.A group of friends and I had an open Sunday, so we decided why not do a fancy dinner. CUT was our pick. Seating was a breeze. Made reservations on OpenTable and got seated at a large round table in the back when we arrived. It was like our own little area. It's difficult not to leave impressed. The waiters and waitresses are amazing here. SO attentive. They offered a variety of complimentary breads on a tray and we were able to select as little or as many as we wanted. Get the focaccia for sure. That was the favorite among the table.I can only speak for what I personally ordered... The U.S.D.A. Prime Rib Eye Steak 12 oz ($59). It was delicious!! Cooked to perfection with a fine crust to give it that extra texture but, be warned, there's tons of fat. On the plus side, fat equals flavor! You can also choose from a list of sauces to compliment your meats. I got to try their Armagnac and Green Peppercorn as well as the Spicy Red Chimichurri ($2 each). Both tasted great with the rib eye. One was enough for 2-3 people. I had a ton left over.All the meats are served a la carte. The table got a double order of Mac & Cheese ($19) and it was TO DIE FOR! So glad we got a double. We also shared an order of their Creamed Spinach ($12) and Wild Field Mushrooms ($22), which were just alright to me. One order for seven people left everyone with only a couple bites of each side. You can see in the attached pictures.Wolfgang Puck knows how to do fine-dining well. The atmosphere is elegant and perfect for celebrations or a nice date. Just wished it didn't dent the wallet so much. I always cringe a little when I see that four $$$$ sign, but you're paying for quality I suppose!Definitely one of the best meals I've had in Las Vegas! Wolfgang Puck has really outdone himself!The rub that is used on the steaks is amazing; it was flavorful and not overly salty. The rub really enhanced the perfectly cooked steak. While the steaks at CUT are amazing and so delicious, I was most impressed by the non-beef dishes. The pork chop is probably the best pork dish I've ever had. It was so tender and delicious. I could have eaten several orders of it! The rotisserie poussin is also fantastic. The meat was super juicy and the truffle-laced sauce was so great. I was so tempted to lick the dish clean. The best part was the great service. Our server was awesome. He was super professional but not snobby. He kept us smiling all night. CUT is definitely now one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. I can't wait to go back.Okay - the food here is absolutely delicious. The Ribeye was so unbelievably tender, and even more delicious topped with bone marrow. The bone marrow dumpling and oxtail soup was flavorful, and the perfect start to the meal. The seafood 'lump' salad was refreshing and light.My only gripe (it was a big one) was the incident that happened at the end of our meal... my friend had brought cupcakes to celebrate a birthday, and was told over the phone it was a $14 flat rate. The cupcakes came, we sang happy birthday, and went along our merry way. However... when the bill came, it was a whopping $168 for a cake cutting fee.$168... are you freaking kidding me? For 12 CUPCAKES? Absurd. A few things...1. You don't cut a cupcake - everyone knows that2. When we spoke to the manager, he said he had spoken to my friend on the phone that day and told her about the $14 per person cake cutting fee - which was a lie... my friend had spoken to a different representative weeks ago3. Desserts at the restaurant aren't even that much4. If we had known about the absurd fee, and it had been communicated to us, we wouldn't have brought in the cupcakesAnyways. 5 stars for food and service, but the cupcake incident was a serious debbie downer for our meal. As a restaurant that charges a premium for food and service, they really need respect their customers more.When you charge $65 - $105 PER steak, the experience has to be out of this world; I was not blown away. If you plan on coming here, keep your expectations in check and have in the back of your mind that you're paying an additional 25% for the Las Vegas dining experience; if you do that, you'll be happy.Onto the highlights of our meal -- the service. My golly the service was spot-on. I felt like royalty dining with the Duchess of Cambridge. When you leave your chair and leave the napkin on the seat, they come by, remove and give you a fresh new one -- it's the attention to detail that makes the service amazing. The complimentary bread was fancy bread that was served table-side with a server placing each bread on your plate ever so gently. However, it was not warm bread -- stone cold bread. I was confused. Most high end restaurants serve bread warm because it just tastes so much better warm. Onto the reason we came: the steaks. 4 of us came here, we ordered the:1. [2x] American Waygu Ribeye 9oz ($88 each): This should have been the star of the show but it was not. Before ordering your steaks, the waiter actually brings raw steaks wrapped neatly and explains the different cuts of waygu and basically sells you on the more expensive cut. We ordered it. Call me a steak-snob, but for waygu, I was expecting melt-in-your-mouth bites -- it was more tough than I expected. It was only marginally better than the 35 dry aged ribeye, and certainly not $30+ better. 2. [1x] USDA PRIME, Nebraska Corn Fed, Dry Aged 35 Days Ribeye 12oz ($63): This was a solid cooked ribeye. No frills, no overselling. Delicious ribeye.3. [1x] Filet Mignon: This was surprisingly the star of the show. It was the melt-in-your-mouth experience I was expecting (and for a fraction of the waygu price). PROTIP (SERIOUSLY PROTIP): If you have a reservation, call ahead, ask to speak to a manager and ask him/her that you want to do "the sampling" of the waygu. If you're convincing enough, they will make a dish with a 2 oz cut of the regular dry-aged ribeye, 2 oz cut of the American waygu ribeye, and 2 oz of the Japanese waygu ribeye. (At least 2 people in your party have to order this) Had I known this going in, I would've done this so you can taste the differences in steaks.Pros: Service is impeccableCons: Oversold on the waygu (good steak, but not "out-of-this-world" great)CUT ranks among the top steakhouses in Vegas for me. SW and CUT are my go to places for a special occasion steak dinner.  My most recent visit was by far my favorite, and it probably had something to do with consuming 8 oz of Japanese Wagyu. I think it has ruined steak for me forever.My husband decided to take out one of his clients to dinner and we opted for CUT located inside of the Palazzo. The decor isn't mind blowing and it is pretty straight forward, but the food makes up for it. I also was not super impressed with our server.  We started off with a bottle of wine ($75 a Cab of client's choosing) and American Wagyu Beef Sashimi. The appetizer was okay, and I would probably opt for something else at my next visit. They brought bread regularly and although not overly busy, the service seemed very slow and almost disorganized. We were able to start a second bottle of wine by the time our server came by to take our full order and go into his spiel about different types of steaks, the marbling, aging process, etc. I went with 8 oz New York True Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef From Satsuma Prefecture, Kagoshima, Japan. It is initially offered at about $140 for the 6 ozs and then each additional 2 ozs are about $40. Well worth it getting the extra 2 ozs, and if you are splurging you may as well leave full. This was the most delicious piece of meat I have (or probably) will ever have. I know that I had a side as well, but everything faded out during that first bite of the buttery, savory goodness that was the steak. My husband had the American Wagyu and it was amazing how appreciable the difference in taste and texture was between the two. We topped off the great meal with some gelato. Well, I am glad my birthday is coming up!Items Selected:Pins & Needles - Tanqeray 10 Gin, Rosemary Syruo, Fresh Japanese Cucumber, Fresh Lemon Juice, Egg WhitePretzel Bread, Port and Walnut BreadGrissiniWarm GougeresMaine Peeky Toe Crab & Carolina Shrimp Louis Cocktail, Spicy Tomato HorseradishBone Marrow Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley SaladMaple Glazed Pork Belly, Asian Spices, Watercress, Sesame-Orange Dressing, Nectarine CompoteYukon Gold Potato PureeTempura Onion RingsAsparagus with Hazelnut Brown ButterSoft Polenta with ParmesanCavatappi Pasta Mac & Cheese with Quebec CheddarSampler of Meats - 1oz True Japanese 100% Wagyu from Miyazaki Prefecture, 3oz Snake River Farms American Wagyu, 3oz USDA 35-Day Dry Aged Prime Nebraska Corn Fed Beef with Housemade Steak Sauce, Bernaise, Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho ButterDouble Espresso over IceValrhona Chocolate Souffle - Whipped Crème Fraiche, Chocolate Sauce, Gianduja Ice CreamMixed Berry Crumble - Toasted Almond Crumble, Lemon Verbena GelatoMascarpone Cheesecake - Blueberry Compote, Brown Butter Cookie CrustPeach Melba Frozen Yogurt Baked Alaska - Peach and Raspberry Compote, White Chocolate Buttermilk CakeBanana Cream Pie - Crème Brulee, Chocolate Sauce, Roasted Banana Ice CreamCaramel and Peanut Ice Cream Bar - Valrhona Chocolate Brownie, Peanut Brittle, Salted Caramel SaucePecan Financiers and Chocolate Chip CookiesGelees, Marshmallows, Nougat, Chocolates, Nutella MacaronImpressed by CUT during a visit several years ago while a medical student visiting Beverley Hills, it was largely a love of neighboring Carnevino and the lackluster service at Wolfgang Puck's Las Vegas locations that had previously precluded a meal at CUT within the Palazzo, a two-hour feast with five friends on a busy Friday night showing textbook execution of pristine ingredients with an almost unthinkably high waiter-to-table ratio.One of the most bustling and vibrant dining rooms in Las Vegas, the energy high as well-dressed tourists decorated every seat in the house with the bar stacked two-deep, it was at a large six-top in the center of the room that our party was seated and with one captain directing a team of at least a half-dozen at our table alone it was not long before water was poured, menus were presented, and cocktail orders began flying.Appropriately described as 'sexy,' the cubed glass, polished surfaces, and low lighting likely to make anyone appear a bit more interesting, attractive, or both it was with an herb-forward elixir costing nearly $20 that I listened to the captain describe several specials and inquiring as to whether the off-menu "sampler" was still available the answer was confirmed as 'yes,' the grissini and gougeres offering contrasting textures of cheese before my favorite piece of ancillary staff, the bread man, arrived.Trying to go easy on pretzel batons and boozy purple bread studded with nuts it was after a short delay filled with chat that appetizers arrived and with a diverse group deferring to my order the crispy glazed pork belly was an undeniable favorite while seafood lovers relished in the fact that two of the party opted not to partake in the reference standard "Louis," the almost-signature bone-marrow a creamier take on the traditional version with bones stuffed by a cloud-light whip nicely complimented by bitter salad and aromatic yet sweet jam.Intrigued by non-steak items including a pan-roasted lobster, chops, and sole it simply seemed illogical to pass on a sampling of Puck's well-sourced Cuts as the primary focus of the meal and offered a total of 7oz for a steep $125 suffice it to say each bite was taken with due indulgence, the corn-fed aged meat from Nebraska the sort of steak that would wow in any number of US Cities while the Snake River American and Japanese A5 Wagyu were exceptional even by Las Vegas standards, the portions actually quite appropriate when taking into account the richness of each.Mostly underwhelmed by sides, the price-to-portion ratio bordering on ridiculous for potatoes, macaroni, and onion rings while the polenta and asparagus were at the very least well-prepared enough  to raise eyebrows a bit, when the time came for desserts the 'all-in' approach was taken, not a single one of the offerings less than delicious with surprisingly sharable portions; the souffle a proudly-standing classic while innovative takes on Baked Alaska and Banana Cream Pie each balanced fruit and chocolate nicely, the crumble simple and as good as rustic restaurant desserts get.It's rarely that I go to a steakhouse only now with all the study done on "red meat" is bad for you and blah blah blah. Who cares, you only have one life to live and eat what you want. If it was up to me ill eat steak everyday... Unfortunately I don't have that kind of money to blow... Cut is expensive and by expensive it's not like your average expensive steakhouse... This here, is not the type of money you can blow on steakhouses unless you won a good amount in the casinos. The cheapest and smallest steak will cost you about $60... High 60s. I don't think I ever got treated to this luxurious fine dining. To spear my BF from hundreds of dollars I chose the cheapest cut and style of meat. The filet mignon, age dry to something days from some mid-west state. It was very tender and perfectly cooked. It didn't have much seasoning in it so you can taste just the meat, but they put sea salt on the table and a bunch of mustard. I don't get the mustard... They said it was a Austrian thing. But once you sprinkled some sea salt on, it was excellent. We also had the tuna tartare and it was amazing! Good recommendation by our waitress. If you're celebrating something or won big, come to cut for one of the finest aged steak!
Sauce Pizza & Wine=Do you like cracker-like, ultra crunchy pizza crust? Then this is the place for you. The menu consists of salads, pizzas and I think a couple pastas and sandwiches. My sister and I came here for lunch with her two young boys (ages 5 and 3). It's the type of place where you order at a counter, they give you a number and then bring your food to you. There is a soda fountain with the usual suspects and some teas. My sister ordered the chicken Caesar pizza, I had the mushroom and pepperoni. My pizza was overly greasy and hers had to be eaten with a knife and fork. The crust is just ridiculous. I'm not kidding when I say it's like a cracker. Only mine got soggy from the grease.The boys did not like their food. The 5 year old had a cheese pizza, the crunch was weird to him and the black stuff on the bottom from the wood fired oven FREAKED HIM OUT. He picked off all the cheese and pretended to eat the pizza all while attempting to avoid the black stuff. The 3 year old had the grilled cheese and he sort of enjoyed it, barely. They use two types of cheese and press it in a panini, which is a little high brow for someone who still sometimes pees his pants. Overall, I sort of enjoyed it, but would not return.
Pho Van Vietnamese Cuisine=Makin' it rain pig blood like it was Carrie's prom night!I do love me a nice big bowl of bun bo hue on a chilly evening.  Since it was raining cats and dogs Friday night,  we decided to go get some Vietnamese food before it got too warm for hot soup!  The dinner companions ordered their own pho, some spring rolls, and banh xeo to share but I was too star-struck with my giant bowl of red-colored Heaven.Sour, spicy, and oh so lemongrassy!  Even though I've never seen bun bo hue so red before, I decided to take a bite and it was bliss.  Admittedly they do go stingy with the pork blood, offering one dinky cube when other places pop in at least two, and the pork knuckle was given away so I didn't try it but the soup was flavorful and fragrant.  I ate every bite and drank most of my soup before the MSG and salt got a bit too much for me.  The spring rolls were also delicious especially with the peanut sauce and the banh xeo seemed to contain mostly bean sprouts.  I'd probably skip on the banh xeo next time.  The #10 pho with eye round and brisket was stated to be excellent with an aromatic broth that didn't even need hoisin sauce.  Great dinner!The restaurant itself is spacious and clean and the owner is super friendly along with the staff.  While the prices are on the higher end for the portion given, this is Chandler so don't be thinking you can get those Phoenix prices here.  The quality is there though.  Nonetheless, I'll be back for more bun bo hue!Since Spring Roll Factory closed several months ago, we've been thinking about trying to find a replacement that served delicious pork noodle bowls, and Pho Van does exactly that.  We stopped in yesterday for lunch and were greeted and seated right away.  I ordered a Vietnamese coffee and my husband ordered a Tsingtao.We started with their egg rolls which are nicely done.  Fresh, flavorful ingredients on the inside and fried nice and light so they weren't greasy.  Really enjoyed those.  I had the lemongrass beef noodle bowl and my husband ordered the BBQ pork noodle bowl.We were both impressed with the flavors of the meat and how tender it was.  The vegetables were nice and fresh too.  I love having a big pile of fresh mint to add to the dish.  The noodles were mostly ok, but a little clumpy.  His beer was good and cold in a frosty mug, and my coffee was nice as well, but it came in a smallish plastic cup full of ice.  I don't know if I'd order that again at $4.95.  Our server was friendly and helpful until the food was delivered.  Then we never saw her again.  We had to go up front to pay, and maybe that's the way they do it, but we never saw an itemized check or receipt.  We had no issues using the Yelp check-in offer of 10% off the total, but like I said, I have no idea what the itemized list was.Before tip and after the discount, the total was $32.11.   We saw several other interesting dishes go by our table and I look forward to trying more items on the menu.  I could see stopping in often for takeout on my way home from work.
The Rib Shack=So I admit I looked over my shoulder a bit when I went to this place...it's not an area I'd go to by myself.  But as most eateries go, this little hole in the wall was mighty tasty.A whole rack of baby back ribs is enough for two people and comes with two sides.  They smoke their own ribs and it's definitely evident in the taste.  The ribs were perfectly cooked and juicy with a nice tangy sauce that wasn't too sweet.  Besides ribs, they do brisket, chicken, st. louis ribs, etc.  They added a little brisket for free in with the order so that we could taste it, too.  The brisket was not as good as the ribs, but it had a good flavor.The mexican cornbread is moist and corny with bits of jalapeno in the mix just for a little bite.The corn on the cob...was cobby.The potato salad was cold mashed potatoes with hard boiled egg, peppers, and whatever else.  It looked like someone pre-chewed it for me.   Despite the strange look of it, it wasn't half bad.  I wouldn't call it the best I've had, by any means.The beans...ick.  At least in my opinion.  It just didn't seem to go with the bbq as well.The staff was very informative and the fact that they threw in something for free just so a customer could try it tells me that they are confident in what they do...and it shows in the food.Price wise they aren't cheaper than other bbq restaurants, although they do often have coupons which I wasn't able to find the other night, but I'll definitely look for them next time I go back.Ribliscious!
Vocé Ristorante and Lounge=My fiance requested my presence at Voce last Tuesday night for a late dinner and entertainment from the Bad Sneakers band.I'd never heard of it before, nor had I ever been in the shopping center that it's located in.  Not the case for many 'regulars' there.  It was packed when we arrived!  FYI - they charge a $10 per person cover for their live music, so be prepared for that and you may also want to go early if you're planning a night at Voce to get a decent seat.  It was a fairly large menu - we had a tough time deciding what to order.  At our waitress's suggestion, we went with an order of the rigatoni with sausage and peas and a pizza la rustica.  Pasta was was great; pizza just decent.  Add wine and your meal can get pricey... $65 + tip for our date night.Check it out for their live music and intimate dining experience - it's not going to be a regular stop in the rotation, but I'd for sure return - especially for Bad Sneakers on a given Tuesday night.
Pho Tay Ho=My favorite vietnamese resto, not just a Pho place...I have been coming here for years. Back in the day, a bowl of Pho was around 5$, prices have gone up quite a bit since, but you can still get a good meal here with a drink for less than 20$ taxes and tips included, which is still a huge deal!!!The Pho really shine here, both the Chicken and Tai Nam variety. My tip for you is: ASK THEM TO PUT KAFIR LIME LEAVES IN YOUR PHO, no matter which option you pick. The lime leaves will bring out a new dimension to all the flavors... trust me just try it :) (I'm vietnamese and grew up eating this stuff). For me, this is the best Pho in town, it is consistently good. Pho is a very fussy thing to make well consistently, if you ever go to a pho place regularly you will notice sometimes the taste is off. For this place though when it's off it's still good, and when it's on, there's just no better.This place is famous for the Tay Ho special bbq dish,  (Bun cha Tay Ho), it comes with different types of grilled meats soaked in fish sauce, vermicelli and a heap of herbs, mix everything in a bowl and eat, the fun part is to mix different herbs each time, add some fish sauce and voila!!!Another signature dish is the "Cha ca" dish, it's grilled tumeric spiced fish on a hot plate, served with vermicelli and a heap of fried onions and dill. This one you eat with a shrimp paste sauce. The flavors in this dish is very pungent, definitely an acquired taste, be mindful if you want to try. But those who like shrimp paste, you will like this dish.Try also the iced coffee, viet style, yum.This is a pretty room, not fancy but bright without being fluo and comfortable and full of bowers of flowers that are probably fake but are white and pretty nevertheles. It's long and narrow with a big of outdoor seating in the summer months. The food is inexpensive and with super quick service and lots of delicious Vietnamese options on the menu beyond the usual Pho and mo' Pho. Not the best Vietnamese I've ever had but very fresh, authentic, and just as yummy as one might hope for. Brings back good memories of beautiful places and wise people who put days of love into a broth.
Yellowtail=On a weekender to Vegas, my gf and I were hungering for sushi one night and the concierge of our hotel (Monte Carlo) suggested going to Yellowtail, the newest restaurant at the Bellagio.  Only open a week,  one might expect some hiccups along the way, but the food was top notch and the service was even more so.The outside entrance signals the restaurant's presence with a beautifully decorated, massive glass tile mosaic of a yellowtail fish.  Indoors, posh, elegant, with clean yet comfortable lines in a contemporary style. Seated at the bar (since we had no reservation), the service didn't slack one bit as our bar waitress was more than knowledgeable, explaining the vast menu choices and offering helpful suggestions on what to order.   Despite the busy atmosphere of having to juggle bar mixology and restaurant patrons, she checked up on us often and made us feel comfortable.  Food wise, my best description for this dining experience would be - sushi fusion.  Combining East and West sensibilities into sushi produced some unique flavor combinations that I've never tasted before.  I'm not talking about your typical California roll here.  Think banana flavored sake, strawberry topped rolls in place of unagi, Big Eye Tuna Pizza with shiso, Toro Sashimi with caviar and microgreens.  The crab dynamite was delicious with generous chunks of crab meat, and a hint of spiciness. One of their signature selections is the Grand Omikase, a six course tasting menu based on the chef's* fancy that day.  I would highly recommend this, as it's the most bang for the buck, and you get to taste a vast array of flavors.  Kobe beef fans will be satisfied as this includes  Washu beef (a domestic breed of Kobe) offered in a tenderloin cut; a texture that just melted in my mouth.Some might think sushi fusion is a bastardization against tradition, but I think it's fun.  Why not try something new?  Your palate might thank you for it.*(Head chef, Akira Back, has worked with industry greats such as chefs Nobu and Morimoto.)Situated inside the Bellagio, Yellowtail is a Japanese Sushi joint with flair, flair, flair.  It looks more like a small lounge than anything else, but they do serve food - and expensive food, at that.I don't recall how much the sushi costs, as I don't eat seafood, but the Jidori Chicken that I had was around $25.  When the waitress first brought it out, all I could splutter was, "THAT'S IT?!"  I mean, it LOOKED tiny.  But I was so hungry, I decided to just shut up and eat - and good thing I did!Turns out, it was really friggin moist, well seasoned, and actually a pretty hefty portion!  No complaints from me!However, the dish wasn't anything sensational.  The reason Yellowtail gets 5 stars is because..I was star-struck.Not by any celebrity sightings... but by waitress sightings.HOLY COW.  EVER SINGLE WAITRESS THERE WAS HOT HOT HOT!  I'm not just talking "pretty,"  I'm talking "HOT"!!!!  With MANY MANY exclamation points.  Hotness must be a requirement to work here!That's not to say that every waitress was a cookie-cutter Barbie.  Nope!  Brunettes, blonds, redheads, White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, tall, short, voluptuous, model-skinny, girly, tough, bitchy, friendly... The variety was endless - but in an oh-so-gorgeous kind of way.  Every single one of them.I'm not a lesbian, but even I got a little giggly around these girls.For sheer eye-candy alone... I have to give Yellowtail five stars!!!WHERE: Inside the Bellagio Hotel/Casino.WHEN: Dinner only! Monday-Thursday, 5pm-10pm. Friday-Sunday, 5pm-11pm. It is also recommended to make reservations during the weekend just incase it gets a little busy.WHY: The dishes are worth the while (or at least the ones that I got the pleasure to try tonight! =D)WHAT: So... first thing's first. I actually got home not too long ago from eating here.  Right after my amazing experience in this great atmosphere, the only thing I could think of was "I'm so going home and writing a review!" So here I am, and here I go...One of my good friends has been talking about how great everything was for the past year. So after a year, we finally got together to make it happen! Prior to getting to the restaurant, I was extremely giddy and excited!!When we got to the restaurant, checked in, and got seated, we automatically were asked what we wanted to drink. Tangent! Before I forget, customer service was at its best! Anyways, back to my experience. We weren't as hungry, so we all decided to get an appetizer each and share. =) That's what friends are for.FOOD: Keep in mind, the portions are small, but so worth your taste buds!We started off with Edamame.  There were 2 bowls, one with cold, salted edamame beans, and the other with a warm and cooked-in-some-good sauce (sweet chili) edamame beans. Always such a great starter!Eggplant Skewers:  One thing, I am not an eggplant fan, but I am not afraid to try it. My friend recommended I try this, and thank goodness she made that recommendation! It did not taste like eggplant at all. It tasted like bbq on a stick brushed with sweet miso and sesame sauce goodness. KUDOS!Big Eye Tuna Pizza:  Definitely not like your ordinary pizza! One of greatest things I have ever eaten! To simplify such a magnificent dish, it was smoked tuna on some type of cracker/bread (which made it a pizza). Everyone must try this! KUDOS!Popping Spicy Crab: Why come to a sushi joint and not order at least one roll?! We made the right choice. If like uniqueness in taste, be sure to taste this roll! Who would have thought that pop rocks (candy) can enhance a simple sushi roll?! It was magical! KUDOS!Lava Cake: For dessert (I always have my heart, mouth, and tummy ready for dessert), I was given the duty of choosing. I chose correct! To explain this lava cake, it was a small, dark chocolate-filled cake, topped with banana foam, and lychee ice cream on the side! Perfect amount, perfect taste, just pure perfection!To sum it all up, I had a wonderful time with my friends, the staff, and most definitely the food. We also got to say hello and converse with Chef Akira Back! He is very down-to-earth and such a great chef!I leave you with this. KUDOS, KUDOS, KUDOS!My hater-ass first reaction to this place was, "Oh Gawd, here we go..." Dim lighting, loungey club music, chi-chi decor and hostesses in slutty stripper-style Mandarin-collared minidresses (because Chinese, Japanese...whatever). Light Group runs this place, and the atmo reeks of pretentious Vegas douche.But once the food started coming, the truth is...it turned out to be FUCKING AMAZING!! I'm not a sushi snob; I'll eat grocery store California rolls and be happy as a pig in shit. But even my undistinguished palate could tell that this was truly exceptional food. (Someone else paid...if I'd had to pay, I probably would cut off a star or two for it being overpriced and pretentious...as I am wont to do :-)My friend and I shared lobster carpaccio, the tuna pizza (!!!!!!!FABULOUS!!!), Japanese snapper (!!!!YUM!!!), octopus sashimi, duck prosciutto (shockingly AMAZING, and I hate duck!!), tuna tataki, some kind of crispy pork roll, and another sushi roll that had pop rocks mixed into the rice (sounds weird, but was AMAZING!!). Every single thing was exceptional, but the ones I marked with exclamation points were pretty much orgasmically good. We had some good desserts, too.It didn't hurt that everything was washed down with a sake flight featuring 6 different types of sake...plus a shot of some cucumber vodka cocktail they feature that was incredible. I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 just because I can't in good conscience give a place this full of itself 5 stars. But srsly... I will MOST DEFINITELY come here again in a HOT MINUTE...as soon as I find someone else to pay for it!! Until then, I'll see you in the sushi aisle at Trader Joe's :-)Being completely honest, I'm usually not a fan of "special events," guest chefs, or the dumbed-down truncated experience of "Restaurant Week" but at $26 (after a deep discount from the quoted $100) with friends already planning on attending Chef Akira Back's "Chef's Tasting" at Yellowtail I tossed caution to the wind...only to reconfirm all the aforementioned prejudices to a whole new degree, leaving the event after 2 hours hungry, a touch intoxicated, and $26 poorer albeit richer in friendships."Spend the afternoon with us at YellowTail inside the Bellagio Las Vegas overlooking the spectacular fountains. Enjoy extraordinary culinary selections from Chef Akira Back and libations provided by Wirtz Beverage.  Chef Akira Back has chosen to feature the Big Eye Tuna Pizza, Crispy Kalbi roll and his famous Baked Crab Hand Roll among other items.  Gulf Oyster Industry Counsel's amazing Oyster bar. Salty coastal waters produce the world's best oysters for the world's best chefs and restaurants, harvested today as they have been for generations.  Chef's menu will be paired with specialty reserved Sakes, Wines & Spirits provided by Wirtz Beverage and custom cocktails created by the mixologists from Hendrick's Gin and Tito's Vodka" as described on the website, the actual format of the event was a standing circus of confusion where "reserved" tables were fed full trays of food while the rest attempted to hunt down one of four circulating servers that were frequently mobbed and stripped clean at the doors where 'diners' gathered like a group of kids playing World of Warcraft sitting on a spawn spot.With booze of decent quality and the modicum of food equally competent a total of six mouthfuls of food plus three oysters were accrued by myself (one literally FROM a reserved table) during the course of the afternoon, probably justifying the $26 though certainly not $100 or the overall aggravation.  With no Akira in site and 'live music' that fell through for unknown reasons I can only assume that this 'event' was a money-grab intended to draw high rollers to The Bellagio or an attention-seeker for an outdated property hoping to generate new fans; both goals a miserable failure as we walked out in search of sustenance down the strip at Aria.Sexy place with stunning fountain views!Walking into this place everything is just sexy. The hostesses, the furniture, the lighting, the tulip on your table and then the stunning Bellagio fountains! Let's begin with the food items which are the whimsical sushi rolls. We ordered a baked crab roll which was very delicate yet filling and the popping spicy crab roll which happened to be the highlight of the evening. This roll had actual pop rocks in it and was so much fun to eat! Note to all sushi places, start using pop rocks! I loved the sweetness from it and it all came together so well.Next we had the Kobe beef flat iron which came with baby root vegetables & potato purée. On the side you receive warm teriyaki glaze and it was smooth & sweet. This dish was good but nothing special. Ordered a side of mushrooms that were great! We also had a few cocktails, one was the sunset that contained grey goose l'orange, blood orange purée and yuzu (nothing special) and then the Infusion which contained pineapple & vanilla infused "early bloom" sake and Bacardi light rum (loved this one) the drink presentations were beautiful with very feminine touches like an orchid and an orange twist.Everything here looks really good and service was on it. When we arrived the place was empty and as we left it was packed. Grab a seat near the windows for the views of the fountains! This part is the cherry on top of this experience.This was the last restaurant in the Bellagio that I had not been to and I decided to give it a go before seeing 'O' again.  I had a reservation for 5 PM to assure plenty of time to eat and relax before the 7 PM show.  I was taken to a two top at the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains.I looked at the menu and my server came and asked about water/other beverages and I ordered my standard iced tea which was quickly brought to the table.  I looked over the menu some more and the server gave me some recommendations.  I decided to order one cold shared plate and one warm shared plate as the server (and some reviews) point out that the shared plates aren't that large.I got the Big eye tuna pizza and the tempura Alaskan king crab.  These were two recommendations from the server and he pointed out that the tempura crab had been on the Best Thing I Ever Ate Food Network show.The tuna pizza was very good.  It had a very, very thin crust with just enough substance to pick up the pieces and eat it truly like a pizza.  The flavors were great even the truffle oil because it was used sparingly.  The tempura crab was a bit of a disappointment.  It was OK but the tempura was a bit heavy and took away from the crab. I couldn't help but think it was a waste of good crab making it tempura style.  It wouldn't go on my list of best thing I ever ate.For dessert, I ordered the Chocolate in a cup.  It consisted of Nutella, banana foam, and vanilla bean ice cream.  The Nutella is in the cup and there's a ring on top of the foam that breaks and dissolves into the foam and ice cream.  It was a great dessert.Service was impeccable.  The view of the fountains is always good.  During dinner, there were three fountain shows.  Prices are Strip prices but I knew this going in so it doesn't affect my rating.
Joel Robuchon=The facts: My finest meal...  ever.My personality: I'm Chinese, being cheap is in my genes.Joel Robuchon at the Mansion was an eye-opening experience.  Never in my wildest dreams did I believe that paying $360 per person would ever be worth it (this is the standard price for the degustation menu), but eating here changed my mind (to tell the truth, you really don't have much of a choice at Robuchon.  Penny-pinchers can opt for the "cheaper" $225 per person menu, but that's about all you have in terms of choice).  Wifey and I walked in breathing fire.  We told each other that no place on god's green earth could ever be worth the money we were about to flush here.  All we wanted was the experience and a nice story to tell about how we were once young and crazy and blew a chunk o' money at Vegas.  Well, the cheap Chinese part of my persona now hates me.  I am very close to saying that Robuchon may actually be worth it.Joel Robuchon is probably one of the world's greatest living chefs.  He has more Michelin stars than he knows what to do with, and has been one of the biggest influences in the post-Nouvelle cuisine era.  The man was a living god even before he appeared on Japan's Iron Chef!Now don't mistake this place for L'atelier Joel Robuchon which is the more casual-themed restaurant nestled right next door at MGM... this place is the Mount Everest of fine dining.So why should you consider dropping a grand on one meal?Well lemme tells ya...Everything here is "over the top".  From the selection of 28 kinds of bread from the bread cart, to the impressively gaudy 30ft ceilings and purple themed dining room, and the requisite snooty French waiter.  Every plate was a work of art and the creativity was impressive.  What softened the pain I felt when I signed the outrageous credit card bill was the fact that they did everything possible to make this worth your hard-earned money.  They shaved truffle onto everything, stuffed foie gras into every nook and cranny, and topped whatever they could with caviar.  In fact, I almost believe that they would sprinkle truffles over the guests if they thought it would make your experience better.  I would recommend this place highly!!***** UPDATE  11/07*****No, I didn't go back (yet)... But I feel VINDICATED now that the world-famous Michelin Guide has reviewed Las Vegas and has determined that the ONLY establishment worthy of three stars is.... Joel Robuchon at the Mansion!As of this writing, the Michelin Guide has only reviewed 4 cities in the US: New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.  Only 6 restaurants amongst all of these cities were awarded 3-stars.  Los Angeles was the only city unable to produce a 3-star winner (confirming my suspicion that El Lay is a terrible food city).Let me get just one thing straight.I am willing to shell out for something good. For something pretty delicious. When I heard about the $360 price tag for a 13 course meal (yeah... that's right bitches. 13 courses - not 16 like I was expecting - and yeah - that pricetag is without wine), I'll admit that I balked. I was hesitant. But hey, if it makes my tastebuds sing - I'm all willing to give it a try.Let me tell you the context - my bf got a big pay raise so he really wanted to go there - hey! what's life if you don't splurge every once in a while.Anyway, we head over to the MGM and yeah, I was wowed. Wow'd by the beautiful chandelier, the plush cushions in the booth seats, the french linens.Nothing could really prepare me for such a big diappointment. First things first - they refuse to give you tap water. They say that they only serve bottled water and you have a choice - fizzy or non-fizzy. And this is at $10 a bottle. Not to mention the server practically jumps to refill your glass after you've taken only 1 sip. Just adding to the $360 tab.As I was contemplating going to the bathroom for a drink of water (from the sink!), they brought a nice palate cleanser - a berry granite  with a citrus foam which was served over dry ice to keep it perfectly cool. Unfortunately it went down hill from there.Basicially, after the next three dishes - tomato/coriander/caviar were a great disappointment. Okay the tomato was served with a tomato gelee. The coriander was served as a foam/gelee thing. Caviar three ways was some sort of gelee/foam thing.By this point, my bf and I was looking at each other thinking - does this guy do something other than fancy jello and foam? My boyfriend leaned over and whispered in my ear - "What's your favorite dish so far?" My answer: "the bread cart" (an impressive 16+ selection of brioche/baguettes). My bf basically agreed. Sad, isn't it?Okay, from there things get a little better. A really good egg ravioli - delicious. A decadent sea urchin flan, a delectable shrimp tea and a subpar lobster bonbon - comprised a shellfish dish. A decent turbot, an okay salmon - nothing too impressive. The Japanese Kobe Beef was pretty good but I've had better preparations of Kobe beef  before. A soybean risotto - fair but nothing to shout home about.There was an interesting margarita - frozen yogurt with effervescent sugar. A yummy herb sorbet (mint flavored primarily). Because it was my bf's b-day, they wheeled out a meringue/ice cream cake with raspberry sorbet. It was beautiful however they gave us only two slivers of the cake and then wheeled the rest away. We're still wondering what happened to the rest of the cake. Then came the mignardises - the impressive cart of petit fours that number at least over 30+ served with coffee or tea. (By the way, being Chinese - they had crappy white tea - just a few sprigs sprinkled in to give the water some color).A sad thing was I asked our server which one of the petit fours were her favorite - she mentioned she'd only tried one. Normally, if you are a server especially at a fancy restaurant like this, you have a good idea what your clientele is eating. Heck even in the lower end restaurants - the same thing. But here, obviously not so.So that's it - we got a lemon loaf on our way out for the next day, copies of the menu accompanied by a sense of feeling like we'd been ripped off. Yes, the presentation of the food was beautifully done and I was impressed. However unique presentation or innovation does not necessarily mean that it will taste very good.And the pricetag - given the ingredients that were used - is wholly not justified. Other than the caviar/Norweigan salmon (tasteless by the way)/kobe beef there wasn't any ingredient that was really expensive.Because of that, I'm giving Joel Robuchon a big two stars - one for the bread cart, one for the petit fours which were the highlight of the visit. Honestly - to truly enjoy maybe 6 of 13 courses and pay $900+ for two people - that's a little too much.Intro:I was floating on a cloud the entire time.Food:We had the six course tasting menu:Avocado pure in a thin herb gele and olive oil flavored curd cheese:  AMAZING.Shaved white truffles and potatoes with olive oil, topped with foie gras carpaccio:  AMAZING.Custard of Gorgonzola with a pear vierge and sage tomatoes:  Decent.Pan-fried sea bass with a lemon grass foam and stewed baby leeks:  AMAZINGGrilled Kobe beef with matsutake mushroom, parsley tempura, horseradish mustard:  AMAZING.  I have to admit, I was a little fearful of the idea of the mushroom and tempura with my Kobe, but it all complimented each other nicely.Pineapple with hazelnut-praline and orange Pekoe tea sorbet:  I didn't have a chance to try this.  At this point, I was feeling like a genuine fatty.Service:It was perfect, just the right amount of attention and knowledge without it being so overbearing.Ambiance:Exquisite.  Very clean and minimal.  Brought back memories of Paris.Overall:This is truly an experience.  It's worth every shiny penny.In the City of Sin, this place is HEAVEN!If you know that there's no way of you entering through the pearly gates of afterlife or if you'd just like to experience it now, you MUST go to Joel Robuchon at the Mansion.  True, the price tag is steep.  But, can you really put a price on the culinary apex.  (I use the word apex because it's all downhill from here.)From one dish to the next Chef Le Tohic just challenges your imagination and palette.  On June 1, 2008, his 16 course tasting menu took us on a mariner's voyage.On a final note, sixteen courses were tough.  Everything was a dream, it was all so good that I forgot to pace myself.  It nearly put me in a (food) coma, and that's when boyfriend started singing... girlfriend in a coma, i know, i know, it's serious.  (silly)Thank you Chef Le Tohic and your staff, especially Jan, our amazing table attendant.  You made my birthday a very memorable experience.==================================Our menu is as follows:  (Amanda B. took great pictures of the meal that night, see Photos)0. Bread - You have to see this.  It's a well presented bread tray, baked fresh daily with nearly twenty varieties.  And, they have them reheated after you choose so they arrive warm.1. L'AspergeBlanche - White Asparagus "Panna Cotta", fresh almonds and lemon grass. - This was simple, refreshing, and well presented dish.2. La Tomate - Salad of tomato, olive oil with basil, tomato gelee topped with mozzarella cheese. - This dish came in two parts, but meant to be consumed together.  The gelee looked like a plate of miniature eyes.  And, the staff shuck the gelee after they sit it down that it made me giggle seeing all those moving eyes looking at me.  But, back to the dish itself.  Wow!  The tomato was such a delight and the gelee made it a really fun dish.3, 4, 5. Le Caviar - thin couscous and Oscetra caviar, smooth cauliflower cream, delicate gelle of green asparagus. - This trio of caviar from Iran was heaven on earth.6. L'CEuf - Egg yolk in a baby spinach ravioli with morels. - When we cracked into to this ravioli, the quail yolk just oozed goodness.7. La Saint-Jacques - Scallops royal with chive emulsion and buckwheat tuile. - The tuile made this dish very playful.8. Les Crustaces - Truffle langoustine raviloli with chopped cabbage, sea urchin, potato puree with hint of coffee and ginger perfumed tea. - Jan highly recommended the langoustine in this trio.  According to him, it is the best dish he's ever had.  And, I have to say, the langoustine is pretty high up on my list too.9. Les Petits Pois - Light pea veloute with mint on top of delicate sweet onion custard. - Good dish, but, at this point, I began to slow down.  Lucky for me, my boyfriend loves a good pea veloute.10. Le Thon - smoked and seared tuna, cauliflower, nori and green curry. - Yummy yellowtail.11. Le Veau - Sautee veal chop with natural jus and vegetable tagliernis flavored with pesto. - The rosemary on the dish was very powerful to the nose.  But, set that aside, the veal was perfect.12. Les Pousses de Soja - Soy beans cooked risotto style with lemon zests and coriander. - The soy bean was presented to me in a way that I never had it before, and it was good.13. L'Acai - Red fruits franite, fresh raspberry and yogurt sorbet.  - This dish really woke me up.  Very refreshing, very good.14. Le Caramel - Caramel cremeux infused with Arabica, chocolate rice soufle.  - Oh, men!  Think of a multi-layered dessert where you have to take your spoon and dip it through all the layers, then in one quick swoop, pull it up and take the perfect bite of chocolate goodness.  As a chocoholic, it was very nice!15. Raspberry Ice Cream Cake - A full raspberry ice cream cake (that could serve 8 people and there were only two at the table) arrived at our table with a candle and everyone wished me a happy birthday, a very sweet touch.  We had this with our favorite teas, I blache and my boyfriend oolong.16 - Le Cafe ou le The - escorte de mignardishes - special tasting of varieties sweet desserts. - I could barely take a bite of the cake, let alone the sweets.  We had a great and the staff was amazing.  Thus, we entrusted Jan to put together a couple boxes of goodies, which was accompanied by two copies of the menu and another full 8" tall, 8" round fruit cake.My 50th review.  Yay.Had the 16 course tasting meal.  One of the best meals of my life.  I can see how the decor is kind of love it or hate it.  I loved it.Excellent service.  The GM came over and had a 15 minute conversation with us.  He then came back to take our order.  Very classy.  After the meal he gave us a very un-rushed kitchen tour.  Throughout the rest of the meal we received incredible service.  I didn't realize that this is the flagship restaurant in the U.S.  It's Robuchon's only fine dining restaurant in North America.  Other two are in Tokyo and Macao.  The Asian influence was apparent throughout the meal.First they bring out the bread cart.  She rattled off like 20 different types of bread then took a deep breath and pointed at the shelf below and rattled off another 6 or 7.  Wow.  Baking done in house.  We tried 9-10 different types of bread - everything great - my fav was the saffron brioche.  The plating of the dishes was beautiful and creative. Every plate was custom made to go with the dish.  The plates also go with the decor.  This was the most visually appealing dining experience I've ever had anywhere.The starter was Osetra caviar over three kinds of crab.  This was amazing but I'll take Keller's oysters and pearls over this.  The plating though was extremely creative - served in a tin on an engraved plaque.Next course was coriander soup with deep fried cilantro and a bruchetta.  I have a little bit of a problem with deconstructed dishes.  I think it's because I'm an idiot.  I never know what to eat first or what to dip in what.  The coriander soup was delicious but a little too plentiful to be just drinking it straight.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to put the fried ciliantro in there and then dip the bruchetta or what.  Still it was a lovely dish and a nice way to open up the palete.The next dish was one of my favs.  Perfectly cooked scallop in ginger/leek broth.  Next was the frog leg.  Wow.  Probably my fav course.  I wish I could take like a dozen of these things to go.  One of the best dishes I've had anywhere in my life.  Bursting with flavor and umami goodness.Next was another one of these deconstructed dishes.  One plate had cooked uni over spiced spinach.  I didn't like the uni.  I know uni is out of season right now, but I've had some excellent uni (cooked and raw) in the last couple of weeks.  Also part of this course was lemongrass roasted lobster - decent.  And finally, was a langostine ball in some curry tea.  That was awesome - bursting with flavor.  Reminded me of a shrimp ball you'd find in saimin - the best "shrimp ball" I've ever had.Next was like a pea puree poured into an onion foam.  I was skeptical when I saw this but wow - it was yum.  One of my fav courses.Next was sea bass which unfortunately was way overcooked and underseasoned.  This was perhaps the only blemish on the meal.Next was sliced foie gras in cabbage ravioli.  Excellent dish - although it is a different experience than eating seared foie gras that melts in your mouth.  Also the cabbage was a little chewy and difficult to cut and I kind of choked on it a little.Next was a deconstructed trio of Kobe beef.  First was ribeye stuffed with carrot and also on that plate was heart of palm stuffed with bone marrow.  NOTE:  EAT A PIECE OF THE RIBEYE AND ONE OF THE MARROW/PALMS IN ONE BITE - much more synergy than eating separately as the marrow explodes in your mouth and complements the meat.  Also was Kobe cheek over silky mashed potatoes.  Definitely best cow cheek I've had.  And finally was a covered bowl of stew that was uncovered by the server when you were ready to eat it.  Very creative and delicious.Finishing off the savory courses was some spring root vegetables over couscous served in a tangine (nice touch).  Probably best couscous  I've ever had.  Very fresh tasting green beans.The desert courses started with picturesque fruit soup served with flowers.  Then a desert tray with as many choices of ganaches, candies and chocolates as the bread cart.  And finally your choice of multiple types of yummy sorbet.  In spite of an off dish or two, everything else was so next-level that I can comfortably say this is one of the best meals I've eaten in my life and without a doubt the best restaurant in Vegas.  Worth every penny - actually for $500/man I say it's a steal.  I can't wait to go back.***500th Review***Wow, where to start? The evening began with an awesome ride in the famous gold limo and a short tour of the Mansion. A hot chick dressed in a kimono leads you through  the Mansion and into food fantasy land. Sadly food fantasy land is incredibly ugly - done up in shades of pale pink and purple with lace doilies everywhere. We ate here 2 weeks after Easter and there were Easter eggs everywhere. Pink, purple, easter eggs.EW.Take out the pastel Easter theme and this place is flawless ! We did 2 courses for $135 and I'd really say 1 course for $105 or 2 courses for $135 is the way to go! You do NOT need to order dessert. Trust me. I could go on all day about the bread. The 35 choices. The fact that they heat up your bread for you. The butter carved lovingly off of a huge loaf with salt sprinkled on top. For us carboholics, you've just reached nirvana. Be careful, however, there's still food coming!The amuse bouche is crab and caviar. Delicious and impeccable.Course 1: It's between here and Alex for the best sea scallops in town. If you're a scallop person, by all means don't miss these. The king crab salad was equally amazing.Course 2: So I made the mistake of getting the lobster. While it was great, my husband ordered the foie gras wrapped in guinea hen. This was the single best dish I've ever had in my life. It sounded blah, but WOW, life changing dish. Like close your eyes in ecstasy dish! So good in fact that for $40 my Dad and I ordered one to share in addition to our lobster. The only travesty is that dish is too small ! I could eat 3 of those , but then I'm a glutton. Dessert: So like I said, don't order one. They bring out this cart of magical delights that's included with your meal, each one more fabulous than the last . FOURTY choices of mini treats. Each one hand painted in metallic colors.. wow.. beautiful, tasty, there really were no duds here. Tahitian vanilla caramels, banana filled chocolates (with actual fresh bananas inside!), white chocolate dipped pineapple... We got 5 or so each, but we should have gotten 10 ! So I'm going to leave you with some help if you're trying to decide between this place and Alex (my other favorite place in Vegas). I liked Joel a little bit better because *limo*guinea hen (best dish of my life)*bread cart*dessert cart However, the rest of the diners in my party preferred Alex. I can definitely agree on an aesthetic standpoint - Alex is just a better dining environment.  I didn't have any of the best dishes of my life at Alex, HOWEVER, Alex overall was more food for the price and every single thing was fantastic. In simple terms, Joel's food ranged from 4 to 5 depending on the dish. At Alex, everything was a 4.5 . My husband summed it up this way: Next time we want a nice dinner, call Joel and see if they have the guinea hen/foie. If they do - go to Joel for the $105 menu and just get that, the bread, the amuse, and the dessert cart! Otherwise, Alex all the way. PS - posted lots of pics. I'm not a big picture person but this place was so jaw dropping I couldn't resist.Nothing here actually WOW'd me.Nothing I ate really made me think 'I HAVE to have this again'.This was like eating in a library. Everyone was quite, they/we were afraid to talk because it was so pretentious. The classical music featured such hits as: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wod-MudLNPA&feature=relatedListen to this song and you can imagine the setting. I was seated on a purple velvet couch with pillows. After fidgeting with the pillows to prop myself up right at the table, well I noticed a foot stool, "odd for such a fancy place" I thought, but I had walked quite a way in 4 inch heels, so I used it.  I later found out this apparently is for you purse. (awkward)First of all, the waiters seemed to hang on your every word, which was annoying. If I want to talk to my date, well i don't need anyone chiming in. I asked my date 'what do you think this means'? Referring to something on the menu, out of no where pops a waiter who answered just as he is about to answer. That's what i mean. The whole meal we had to whisper, we finally started texting each other. That's pretty bad.If I smiled the head waiter would come over and ask if I needed something. I would say 'no I'm fine'. Pretty soon I just kept smiling to drive him crazy, it worked. He kept stopping at every pass. He probably now thinks I had the hots for him.QUICK TIP: For those of you too embarrassed to ask: If you see a menu item that says (supp $40) after it, that means on top of the menu price they add $40 dollars to it for whatever reason, like the truffle cheese souffle. They said it was because of the amount and price of truffles used. The lamb, well I guess it was a baby lamb fed gold flakes and the milk of the gods .Anyway on to the food: The amuse bouche (aka "gift from the chef") was a tin on a plaque. It looked like a tin of caviar, but it had something creamy under it. It was interesting. I ate it to be polite, but it was nothing special. In fact it was rather flavorless and the texture was off putting. It looked pretty.Everything was plated beautifully.The crab salad was my favorite menu item and my second course. It was excellent and almost too pretty too eat. The flavors and texture combined were amazing.My dates cheese souffle was too rich for me. The date ate it and was "not impressed".  The expensive truffles really did not seem to add anything to the dish other than a presentation factor.The main course I picked was lobster. It was beautiful, but a little tough. I expected it to melt like butter in my mouth. It didn't, in fact it was hard to cut. The flavor was ok, nothing special.I tried my dates lamb, it was very good, it tasted like any other lamb I have had at a restaurant, which made me wonder again why the upgrade in cost.The best part about the meal to me, was the bread cart. OH My God! It was pure heaven! They really need to open up a bakery for these clouds from heaven. They had the flakiest, butteriest, most flavorful, wonderful assortment of goodies, well i almost filled up on bread. You can have as many "cart items" from any cart, as your heart desires, don't be afraid to say "one of everything" when a cart comes strolling by. After 2 trips of the cart i pretty much did. There was garlic rosemary twists, brioche, cheese breads, croissants, crostini, baguettes, almost every type of bread imaginable and the absolute BEST!The $20 martini or specialty drinks were delicious, worth $20 a pop? Not really. I did not taste or feel any alcohol. I think we should have gone for a nice bottle of wine.Our actual desserts that came with the menu, they were odd. A strange menagerie of ingredients that I still am not sure if they went together well. I did not finish mine.The dessert cart was pretty, none of the candies/treats were anything special. Coffee and water are extra$.After the meal here ( $680 for 2), I wondered if rich people eat like this all the time, and if so, well I am glad I am not that rich or stuffy. I am, however, a food connoisseur. Someone who has always dreamed of eating at a 3 Michelin star rated restaurant, someone who would really appreciate the whole experience. I was somewhat disappointed, but I was truly happy for the experience.Note: I talk about price a lot, but in actuality, $$ is no object for me. So it is more FYI for middle income, average diners visiting for special occasions.I just got back from dinner with my wife a couple of hours ago and I could not wait to review it. I'm not a 'foodie.' I can appreciate fine dining as much as the next guy, but I'm equally, if not more so at home eating late night Jack in the Box. It was my wife who insisted on us coming here to celebrate her birthday, because she wanted to enjoy a dining 'experience.'Let me be clear about this: anyone who has actually eaten here and gives this place anything less than a full five stars is out of their freaking mind. Joel Robuchon is not just an amazing restaurant, it is literally the greatest culinary experience I have ever had in my life. And I have eaten at a number of fine establishments. And it's not even a close call.At the time I made the reservations, I mentioned a severe nut allergy. More on that later. We are staying at Vdara and they sent a limo to pick us up. Tres chic. It makes one feel like they aren't just having dinner, but rather that they are now experiencing an event.We drive through the back side of the MGM, to the Mansion, where our limo driver, A.J., drops us off and escorts us to the door. There we meet  Susie (who initially took my reservation), who greets us on cue and escorts us through the door, through a stunning courtyard, then through the mansion and finally out onto the casino floor and into the restaurant. From there, she guides us to our table. From start to finish, we never had to stop, it was one continuous motion from limo exit to being seated at our table. If you've ever seen "Goodfellas," there's a scene where Ray Liotta is introducing Debra Winger to life as his gf. The camera follows them through a back door, through a kitchen, and finally to a private table in front of a show at a club. We see the wonder on her face at what an amazing experience she's digesting. THAT is what you feel like. So effortlessly VIP it makes you question why you ever thought that you'd experienced VIP service before in your life.A host of staff are at your service. A somolier, your server, a manager...at every step of the way, the server reminded me that he remembered our food allergies and gave warnings about specific dishes, or in the case of the desert cart, only brought out those desserts which we could eat.I started with the mint pea cream soup, which was stellar, and my wife had the king crab app which was just beyond. Server comes by and asks if we want bread. Sure, why not? OMG, the guy's bringing out a tray with like 15 different types of bread and telling me about each one! Sweet. I love friendly, knowledgeable servers. Main courses were the foie gras for her and the salmon for me. Unreal as to both. For dessert, they surprised us with a birthday cake for my wife and then an assortment tray. Bill comes...'hey, you're staying at Vdara, right? Would you like to just charge that to your room?" Are you kidding me?? We're eating at a restaurant in the MGM Grand and you're offering me the option of charging my dinner to my room at Vdara?? Would I like to do that? Sure, I would, thanks for asking Romiro! And thank you for the gift bag that every diner gets when they leave.And finally, Susie with the escort back to our waiting limo and then the ride back to our suite. Oh, did I forget that the chef even came out and thanked us for coming? And not like pretentious annoying chef, I mean like really friendly thank-you-so-much-for-eating-at-our-restaurant exuberant chef. He even posed for a pic, which might have been tacky on our part to ask him to do, but whatever, he was game and we wanted something to remember the experience by.Now, let's be honest with ourselves for a moment. Our dinner ran a combined $450 when you add in the wine, the tips, the food, etc. That's not a cheap dinner, even if it does unfold over a leisurely 2 1/2 hours. And with a different wine selection, or an upgrade to the 16 course meal that they offer, a dinner for two here could easily run upwards of $1,000. But, if your budget allows for such an extravagance, you will be hard pressed to ever have a better dining experience in your entire life. And I guess that's not a bad price to pay for such a memory.Three star michelin in North America is rare. French Laundry, Joel Robuchon and few spots NYC....that's about it. Expectations are high and Joel's outpost in Vegas doesn't disappoint. The recession has certainly had its effect here as I doubt many can dine on 16 courses at $385 anymore without the expense account. They now offer a variation of smaller 2-6 course menus. Simpler and perhaps with more reason. So how does this compare in the world of French Laundry, Per Se, Alain Ducasse, El Bulli? Pretty well.We were staying at the MGM so the gold limo and private entrance we'll have to assume are pretty sweet. The quaint, regal homely dining room is impressive and the purple banquet seating is perfect for letting the food settle in. But the ultimate key is the food.Highlights -Bread cart - amazing selection, sample at least 3-4 pieces, the sweet rolls were buttery goodnessTruffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage (Suppl. $30) - amazing pocket of bursting flavour, well worth the suppl and the best appDuck and seared foie gras with cherries and fresh almonds - my love affair with foie continues with this amazing preparationSpring lamb skewer with sweet spices, vegetables with lemon confit (Suppl. $25) - easily the best main, so tender and not a hint of gameyness.Moka - The (i.e. French candy/chocolate cart) - This sweets cart just amazes. Like Charlie in the Chocolate Factory in French, I couldn't resist the hazelnut chocolates and truffles.So, it is expensive and it is a dining experience worth the price. The food was top notch, the service was impeccable and the bread/sweet carts are an offering unique onto itself. I'll be back once the credit markets free up again.My dining experience at Joël Robuchon started with a ride in a gaudy-ass gold-colored limo with leather top.  No joke.  The limo was right on time (as opposed to being five minutes late like us), picked the four of us up in front of our hotel and whisked us to The Mansion, a part of MGM that perhaps 98% of Vegas visitors have never seen, heard, or set foot on (present company included). So we were taken to this gated entrance, cobblestoned driveway (which was not exactly fun to navigate in 5" red soles) and lush indoor garden surrounded by balconies from the 29 plush suites (which apparently requires a line of credit of $300,000 to qualify to stay).  Then we were ushered by our hostess through the corridors flanked by high roller tables and $25 slot machines, directly to the heavy doors of Joël Robuchon.Behind the heavy doors was a small yet whimsical space dominated by purple and black velvet - opulent almost to the point of gaudy (but not quite!) - and  filled with hushed conversations of other dinner patrons.  Then it turned into a French lesson.  The hub, fortunately, is fluent in French (or should I say Canadian French), having born and raised in ON so it was somewhat interesting hearing him converse in French with the server and maitre'd.  Thankfully, the menu contains English translation and the server does speak English with a lilting French accent, so it didn't end up being too embarrassing for the rest of the group.We unfortunately did not have enough time for the $350 / 16-course menu so we settled for the five-course a la carte menu of l'amuse bouche - a serving of delicious, delicate black caviar which I could've had three of; appetizer (the French, just like the rest of the world outside of America, calls this part of the meal entrée.  For the Americans who do not believe me - I kindly refer you to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrée); soup; main course; dessert; and finally moka and thé (coffee and tea) with petit fours. As soon as we ordered, we were approached by a smiling server pushing a bread cart filled with what could've been twenty different kinds of petite carbohydrate goodness.  Between the four of us, we had saffron focaccia, basil focaccia, bacon-filled bread (which we verified is not French, but rather a genius creation of the chef), and lots and lots of traditional French petit pain.  The rest of the meal was a revelation that we were oohing and aahing throughout.  My appetizer consists of king crab with cauliflower cream and seasonal vegetable - an unlikely combination that turned out to be delicious and refreshing.  For soup, I had the light, frothy and fluffy chestnut cream with foie gras, bacon bits, and lardons foam.  Then I had the braised veal cheek with galangal-and-ginger-infused Thai broth, vegetable couscous and brocolli as the main meal and finally a banana creme caramel with yuzu ice-cream, whose tanginess went really well with the crunchy sweet honeycomb candy.  We sat back, sated and content while waiting for our server to bring out the coffee and tea.  Ordinarily I would've chosen a pot of green tea to cap off the meal, however the experience was anything but ordinary so I settled for a strong, black French press coffee, hold the cream and sugar.  The bitterness of the coffee complemented the petit fours that we had a lot of trouble selecting from the 45 available on the cart.  My absolute favorite was the blueberry opera cake and eclair, although the strawberry cheesecake dipped in white chocolate was pretty darn good as well.  As we were paying, the same hostess who greeted us at The Mansion came right by, advised us that the limo is ready, and off we went to our next stop: XS.My first Michelin 3 Star Restaurant starring the Chef of the Century. Well, not exactly, since we didn't get to meet Mr. Robuchon. However,The experience was amazing even sans Robuchon. And that's exactly what it is - an experience. Like going to the theater or opera. It's not just *eating.* Be prepared to spend some serious cash, but if you are considering dining here, you probably already knew that.First off, the restaurant is beautiful. I love the color combination of silver, purple, and black so I felt wrapped in shimmery goodness. Behind my shoulder to the right was Chuck Norris, and to my left was Nic Cage, so I was also in good company.They offer 5 menu options for you to select your own dishes. Each person at the table can have a different tasting menu which was a nice surprise, as most restaurants don't allow that. The first menu option starts at $109 and the 16 course degustation is close to $400. I went with a menu option that inlcluded an amuse bouche, a soup, an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. As with all of the tasting options, you also get to select from the amazing bread cart at the beginning of the experience, as well as from the decadent mignardises cart at the end.To recap our 3 hour experience: The bread cart:If bread can be described as beautiful, this cart certainly was. I had bacon bread, basil brioche and saffron brioche.Amuse bouche:Caviar on top of a crab and lobster salad. This was excellent and a perfect contrast of salty and sweet. My favorite part was when our waiter said something like: "Mr. Robuchon requests that you dip your spoon to the bottom of the dish to taste the full flavor combination."Appetizer:Salmon tartare topped with caviar. Very good, but probably the least memorable of all of my dishes.Soup:Chestnut and foie gras with bacon and celery foam. Ah, those little pieces of foie gras were scrumptious. Entree:Turbot and octopus with a lemongrass emulsion and baby leeks. Perfectly executed. Dessert:A whimsical combination of creme brulee, hazelnut pop rocks candies, chocolate marshmallow, and ice cream. The plate was decorated with metallic purple paper and purple sparkles. Love.The mignardises cart:So glittery and pretty. I sampled a blueberry opera cake, strawberry white chocolate cheesecake, limoncelo macaroon, caramel with chocolate, and raspberry chocolate cake. Served with Brazillian french press coffee. In lieu of dessert:My husband opted to choose from the very impressive cheese cart. Wow. As with the bread and pastry carts, you can basically select an unlimited amount of cheese. Unable to resist, I snuck a few pieces of his cheese. If you are so-so on desserts, definitely go this route. Other random musings:If you are staying at the MGM and sign up for the Prima VIP upon check-in deal, you get a free bottle of champagne with your meal! When you make your reservation, just mention Prima.There's also a free limo service that will bring you to the restaurant. We didn't partake since we were staying at the MGM.  I regret that since they drive you by the luxurious Mansion at the MGM, which most people don't know exists. It runs $5-15k/night. In conclusion:If you win big in Vegas and appreciate an excellent culinary experience, definitely come here to celebrate. But please don't don your Flamingo attire - jackets and cocktail dresses are a must.Joel Robuchon is the "chef of the century".  This place has three michelin stars, 4.5 stars on yelp, and recommended by foodies.  So naturally, after dining at a handful of michelin restaurants, we had high expectations for Joel Robuchon.  For chris sakes, Rod Stewart was sitting at the table behind us!!!  Furthermore, Joel Robuchon was in Vegas that night, and seeing him added a little extra touch.  After doing extensive research, my boyfriend and I opted for the two courses.  Here's our story:The Pros:- Bread cart was AMAZING!!!- Dessert cart was awesome!- Amuse-bouche was yummy caviar- The limo ride was very much appreciatedThe Cons:The Food.  Aside from the above, everything was disappointing.  - Le Canard: duck was passing at best.  The foie gras on the side was overcooked. We love foie gras, but had to force it down...foie gras should not be that way.- The King Crab wasn't even memorable.  I was disappointed after a taste.  It wasn't bad, just nothing special.- La Châtaigne soup was very bacon in flavor.  I can honestly compare it to bacon cooked on a stove top, and thrown into cream sauce.  The foie gras in the soup was overcooked as well.  I wouldn't even know it was foie gras unless I read the menu. - Le Veau: veal was passing.  It wasn't something I tasted and felt "wow, I must have this again".  After we finished our "experience" we felt disappointed with the food, and mentioned that it is not worth three michelin stars.  In addition, I started to feel queasy.  I thought it was the food's richness, however, if only that were it.  I spent the whole night amidst a toilet, throwing up.   I had one glass of wine, so it was not alcohol related.  Drunkedness and heart burn over food poisoning any day.  FAIL!In my honest opinion, Joel Robuchon in Vegas is living off of its hype.  It's either politics that gave him the stars, or what it used to be.  But the quality is sub-par, so save your money, do not dine here.  So overall:Joel Robuchon's Food - BADFood Poisoning - VERY VERY VERY BAD!!!!Michelin Stars #20, 21, and 22Let me start by answering your questions;"No" and "No."For my 30th birthday present, my wife treated me (us) to our first 3 star dining experience. My hopes were sky-high as we rode in our complimentary limo ride into the back of the MGM. We were escorted through the private baller area of the casino to the main entrance of the restaurant. Once inside, we were greeted with what might happen if you filled Barney the Dinosaur with gold and velvet and then blew him up, a purple pantheon of out-of-placeness. Of course, when having a once in a lifetime meal, you never order a la carte, you go all out with the 16 course degustation menu. Which leads me to some of my major gripes of the meal; the amuse was counted as a course, there were no intermezzos, apéritifs and digestifs to break up the heavy French food, and the amazing cheese cart was not part of the tasting!I lack the energy to describe each course in detail as I often do, but most of it was really really good. A couple were jaw droppingly good, yet others were only okay, and only okay for any place. For the price and the reputation, I expected so much more. I expected the foie gras to shed new light on the start of the universe and for the veloute to show me god, but no epiphanies were had that night. Service was spot on, never smothering or pretentious, and the wine guy guided us well. The pre-dinner bread and separate butter carts were equally amazing. For the money though, we both agreed that we would choose Urasawa, Spago, or Providence in a heartbeat for another meal. So now for your questions;Was it worth it? NOWould we go back? NOPS - No good pictures because my old cybershot took a shit that day, so I bought a Sony Nex-3 and had no idea how to use it for dinner =[Joel Robuchon could not possibly have done more in the way of service and presentation.  To give you an idea of what I mean:  a couple next to us ordered tea.  The wait staff brought a cart by with a variety of live potted tea plants.  While wearing white gloves, they cut the individual tea leaves off to put in a cup of warm/hot water, which was heated by a small candle.While walking to the restaurant, I was a little skeptical that the ambiance would live up to its reputation.  Located in the middle of MGM Grand, you pass slot machines in a smoke filled casino when walking to the entrance.  However, once inside, you are transported to the serene, rich, and romantic world of Joel Robuchon.Plush purple seats, amazing artwork, beautiful floral arrangements, and a stunning chandler in the center of the room.  The bathrooms, while chic, were actually a little difficult to use.  Everything was black.  The floors, the toilet, the sink, the linens--everything black.  Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but the lighting in the bathroom is pretty low, making it seem like you're taking a pee and washing your hands in outer space.The food was exquisitely presented and flawlessly executed.  There was never a hint of sloppiness or unsteady hand.  This was a masterful representation of culinary precision.HOWEVER...*************Ultimately, for a 3 Michelin star restaurant and a $600+ bill for two, I expect the absolute best dining experience of my life.  Everything here was the best I've ever experienced--except for the food.  There was not a single dish that I will remember.  All of the dishes tasted good, but none were exceptional in my mind.  This is the sole reason I gave four out of five stars.I may not have eaten at other 3 Michelin star restaurants, but I have eaten at other 5-star AAA restaurants and James Beard Award-winners' restaurants.  It was there that I experienced the sensation of my jaw dropping and my mouth watering long after eating--not at Joel Robuchon.*************I still implore you to come here if you want to experience the best service, presentation, and ambiance a restaurant can offer.I thought my review was starting to run long, so here is a quick summary of the individual food dishes I tried:For our anniversary, we got the 4-course menu selection.Caviar L'Amuse-bouche: presented in a round metal tin, which was both cool and tacky.  It felt a little like I was being served a can of sardines.  It tasted good enough, but I still don't see what the big deal about caviar is.Truffled langoustine ravioli: the umami flavor from the truffles floods your palette, but then leaves a sweet lobster finish. Foie gras with artichoke: pretty and well balanced.  Chestnut soup: Tasted like a bacon latte.Pan fried sea bass and octopus with lemon grass-way too much lemon flavor.  I couldn't taste anything else.Beef ribeye, wasabi spinach: perfectly cooked and tender.  Fuji apple confit, cinnamon sable and Manzana milkshake: I probably would've preferred a brownie and ice cream over this dish.Guanaja chocolate with coffee ice cream, caramelized puffed rice and lemon confit: ice cream and chocolate were yummy, but the lemon confit took over the whole dish.They offer dozens of different breads.  Butter from France, olive oil from Spain.To finish the meal, they offer 60 or so different varieties of little chocolates.  My favorite was the French Mystery.  Imagine the tiniest possible little bite size éclair.  And then, imagine it has a little baby, and that baby sits on top of its mommy.  Now you're picturing the French Mystery.To celebrate our anniversary, the restaurant surprised us with a sorbet and coconut cake with orange sauce.continue from the original review... ******* like any true french restaurant (and italian), the moka was served to complete a meal. a miniature french pressed coffee for me (cappuccino and espresso are other options) and a pot of white chinese herbal tea for the hubby, accompanied by a complimentary surprise birthday cake, were presented to us. the coffee was quite delicious and strong but never with that bitter after taste. by then we were full, but this cake was phenomenal, the BEST THING I EVER ATE! this white cake was layered with fresh cream, passion fruit filling, mango sauce and meringue. i don't eat mango and i am partial to the sweetness of meringue, but the moment this cake touched my mouth, i knew i could die happily. there are some notable things to elaborate in this review; the much talked about carts. there are 4 different carts being wheeled around throughout the dinner. all servers memorized each and every item on all 4 carts (that's like over 200 names)...quite a challenging task. the first was the bread cart which seriously had more variety than any bakery i've visited. once we selected our choices, the waiter warmed them up before bringing them to our table. they were very generous with the bread and we enjoyed a few different types, but our favorites were the bacon epi baguette and cheese brioche. also, the french butter and olive oil were nothing like we had before, even in europe. the mignardise cart which was stationed in front of the entrance ever beautifully was presented to us. we let the waiter use his magic and knowledge to pick the best for us. unfortunately, we could not consume more than 1 out of 10 pieces after that BEST EVER cake. our waiter kindly packaged these tiny, bite-sized desserts to take home along with two boxes of citrus and berry marshmallows (i can tell you that these are not your every day marshmallows!) and a colorful booklet showcasing joel robuchon las vegas. the cheese cart which we did not partake in, looked quite impressive. i could smelled the pungent cheese a mile away. they were paired with nuts and pieces of fruits. the last was a cart designated for tea. not only did this house a variety of dry tea leaves, it had live potted tea plants, from lemon grass to mint. all i could say was "omg...unbelievable...omg!" the waiter would cut the leaves of your choice, wearing white gloves, and serve the tea in a pot, heated and stayed warm by a candle. another food item we were impressed by was the mashed potato which was served with our main course. this was pure butter (i don't want to know how much of butter was used here), and we could've had a bucket of this and more. one last thing that made our experience at joel robuchon more memorable and unforgettable was the people who were dining around us. a table of chinese family in flannel shirt, fishing vest and white shocks (this is 100% true although i would not recommend this attire), paying everything in cash, a table of two jewish businessmen in fine italian suits sharing their experiences at pierre gagnaire and alain ducasse in paris, taking pictures of every dish for their wives, a table of a lone lady with french accent gormandizing the degustation menu ever graciously, a table of persians with their colorful ties, talking and laughing about how much they were down (i admire their good nature even when they lost so much), and a table of older couple congratulating our celebration of birthdays, envying the BEST EVER cake.  who's counting the michelin stars and aaa five diamonds?  this was a place that never tried to display an air of snobbishness you often face in other restaurants of this caliber. everyone talked to each other no matter where you came from. at the end of the meal, we were escorted back to the mansion where a silver limo was waiting to take us back. the driver asked, "did you take a picture with mr. robuchon?" WHAT? the man was there? i guess it never hurts to ask. we found out the chef of the century usually shows up for long weekends when vegas gets busy. i cannot wait to take this journey again. we cherished every minute of our dining experience here. we were treated more like friends surrounds by people who enjoy lives as much as we do. when you are here, take a look around the restaurant. amidst the ritzy extravagance, you'll see and appreciate the personal touches of joel robuchon everywhere.I glanced over all these rave reviews and I'm sorry I get lazy to go into detail bc it seems so redundant!  So, here's another gushing review of this place, I'll try and keep it short!Came here for a lovely Valentine's dinner and..It's awesome. So far, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  Love the dark decor with purple furnishings, dazzling chandeliers, glod accents, and plush cushions.  Their service was on point.  The plating was beautiful and flowed nicely.  The only thing I didn't enjoy were their fake candles.  I guess they got sick of scraping wax off the tables?My favorite is the bread cart--I'm a carb girl.  I could sit there and eat bread all day and be satisfied.  We had the 4-course dinner and we were beyond full by the time we got to dessert.  I'm not sure how people eat the 6 course or even the 16 course tastings.  I guess you'd have to skip out on the bread.The foie gras was my favorite, as usual.  It literally melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting MORE. The second favorite was the dessert cart with coffee.  I love picking and choosing and then picking more! Just like the bread cart my eyes get big and I get greedy! Can't wait to come here again so I can try the 16 course tasting.  Gotta save something for next time, right?I told Gage that words could not describe it.  He asked me to do an interpretive dance.  I'll spare you.  But it was magical.It's worth it.  It's a dining experience of a lifetime.  A dinner for 2 was more than my rent.  Way more.  Still worth it.  The bread cart is delicious.  They have bacon bread.  Score.  The cheese cart is amazing.  I tried everything.  Everything.  The little candy cart blew my mind.  And everything before and after surpassed all of my expectations.  I will say this though.  I enjoyed the regular menu items MORE than those with the supplemental price.  And what's this?  A parting gift...for me?  Why, thank you.  They gave us a pistachio cherry pound cake for the road.  It was wrapped in purple cellophane, in a pretty black bag that marked the name of the restaurant.  That pound cake accompanied me to the Hard Rock for Gambling.  To a Strip Club.  To a night club.  More Gambling.  Made it through 4 cab rides.  And finally, back home to share with my culinary classmates.  Just don't tell them the pound cake was inside Hustler.My husband and I went to Las Vegas for a quick honeymoon after our wedding since we both had to go back to work. He booked Joel Robuchon after research and reading about how amazing this place is.  Our trip to Joel Robuchon started out wonderful. A limo picked us up from our hotel and we got a walk through the gorgeous MGM mansion. The decor of the restaurant was beautiful. Then the wine list came and my husband LOVES wine so he asked to speak to the sommelier with a few questions about the wine. The sommelier arrived at our table and rather hesitatingly answered my husband's few questions then proceeded to steer us towards another page with the comment "I think you'll find these more in your.. price range"record scratch.uhm, excuse me?! Yes, we are both in our mid twenties and it doesn't help that we are asian and therefore look like we are in our teens but here we are, about to shell out at least $600 for a meal (ours ended up around $800) that comment was so unnecessary in so many ways. We were both shocked into silence and proceeded with our meal.Then came time for dessert. During the course of our meal we saw the tables to our right, left, front, and back be served complimentary desserts/cakes for anniversaries, birthdays, etc. We ended up with nothing despite the fact that it was our honeymoon. I'm not one to complain about complimentary things but it was a little ridiculous considering literally everyone in the restaurant was getting them except us. Perhaps we were not in the.. price range..Overall the food itself was really really spectacular. The bread and dessert cart was amazing and every dish that came along was just exquisite. However the service completely ruined our meal and it was really really disappointing. We've never dealt with such condescension at any restaurant and was definitely not expecting it from such a highly renowned place with a michelin star.When I was asked to dine at a AAA Five Diamond, Forbes Five Star, Three Michelin Star, Wine Spectator Grand Award and Chef of the Century's restaurant, the question wasn't IF...It was WHEN!My last night in Vegas marked the unforgettable occasion and as soon as I opened those shiny glass paned double doors, I knew I was in for a treat!  As I walked across the foyer into the main dining room,  I left the hustle and bustle of the frenzied casino behind me and I was instantly transported into a luxurious 1930's style French bistro with a huge crystal chandelier cascading above me. Honestly, this place was dripping with opulence!Truth be told, I do get a bit uncomfortable in fancy schmancy restaurants.  Perhaps it's the well pressed white table cloths or the half dozen stuffy staff serving my every whim, but this place was not like that at all.  The servers were warm, friendly and present without being overbearing, which was really nice!  Add to that the elegant yet inviting atmosphere and I was feeling like a king! A hungry one at that!     As soon as we were seated and handed our nicely bound menus, I instantly knew in my mind that I wanted to try the 16 course tasting menu.  Heck, you only live once, right? Because we were in a festive mood, we decided on a bottle of bubbly and for me, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot fit the bill perfectly!Then came the famous bread cart in all its glory! Wow! It was a sight to see! There were more than a dozen breads to choose from to start the meal and i think we tried almost all of em!  Three magnificent breads, however, stood out from the pack.  Those being the buttery cheese brioche, savory bacon epi, and chewy cheese baguette.  Then, of course, came the food! Honestly, it was so beautifully plated there were times I simply felt it was a shame to eat it! But I got over that hurdle fairly quickly. Now, I don't plan on boring you with the entire 16 course blow by blow, but I will focus on the dining highlights which made the evening extra special for me!Amuse Bouche "sangria emulsion" refreshingly light citrusy blood orange cream emulsion above a chilled jam in a whimsical dry ice bowl with small chunks of apples and berry sangria gelee.  Lip smacking tartness with a delightfully smooth & creamy finish! Excellent way to awaken the palate!  Trio of Caviar Caviar with Asparagus - Although not the most interesting pairing of the evening, the flavors of the fresh green asparagus and salty caviar played well against each other. Salmon Tartare with Shiso Sprouts and Caviar - The textures were delicate and the flavors were refined.  Daikon Cous Cous with Caviar - The thin delicate slivers of cool daikon wrapped around fluffy cous cous and topped with caviar was an exhilarating finish to an interesting play on Japanese cuisine.       Lobster - Topped with fragrant black truffle, the langoustine ravioli was magnificent! The grilled lobster was simple yet beautifully presented. Subtle flavors but hey it's lobster! Sometimes a good thing shouldn't be messed with! The smooth & creamy sea urchin fennel potato puree was inspiring and texturally inviting, as well.Chestnut Soup over Foie Gras Foam - Rich frothy and flavorful with savory bacon bits. The chunks of roasted chestnuts added a subtle sweetness to this warm and rustic soup. Bone marrow - One of my personal favorites! The marrow was luscious, rich and supple in texture. It also exhibited the most irresistible aroma! The popcorn added a pleasant textural dimension to this delightful dish.Sea bass - Beautifully seared, this magnificent piece of fish came bathing in an irresistible butter sauce. The artichoke balanced the flavor profiles nicely. Birthday Cake - As the evening came to a close, the staff came out with a cart embellished with lavish decorative baubles and a small sign that read "Happy Birthday" The accompanying birthday cake was extraordinary! Perched on a large black pedestal, it was absolutely majestic but all I could think of was digging into it!  To my surprise, it was a mango meringue ice cream cake and although we couldn't take it home with us, we did indulge in two large decadent slices and it was fantastic! Bravo to the dessert chef!If that wasn't enough we were given free reign of the mignardises (dessert cart) that had a vast selection of petit fors, small cookies and yes...macarons!They boxed up the cookies and gave us an additional box of marshmallow treats to take home with a copy of the menu and a nicely bound colored brochure documenting the magical evening.I'd have to say this was by far the most amazing dining experienceof my life.  Would i do it again? Someday. But for now, I'll just revel in the fine memories of an unforgettable evening that will leave my palate in infinite bliss!Happy "Birthday" Eats, Part Deux!!A French chef once told me "French people are born with two gifts, making love and making food. "  While I sadly cannot speak to the prior, the latter is exemplified by Joel Robuchon.The short review:  THE BEST!The long review (sorry its so long):Three Michelin stars and the AAA Five Diamond award speak for themselves.A meal at Joel Robuchon showcases the French passion for food, respect for ingredients, deftly practiced restraint, and the melding of cutting edge cooking techniques with the traditional.  The presentation is nothing short of breath taking yet everything on the plate has a purpose.  Ahhh like a beautiful yet sensible woman.While the core of each dish may be the same, portion size and the way they are dressed varies depending on what menu you order them from (a la carte, pre fixe, or degustation).  Keep this in mind when trying to follow the recommendations of another.  The current menu standout is the signature truffle langoustine ravioli.  A see through thin wrapping envelopes a core of sweet, moist , langoustine tails dressed by an incredible foam (not your typical brown butter sauce), and doused in a generous amount of shaved black truffles.  Sensuality on a plate.The current 16 course ultimate degustation menu was nothing short of perfection.  Course after course of pure artistry and intriguing flavors.  How about a salad of haricot verts (green beans) with Parmesan and foie. So simple.  So delicious as the richness of the foie and the earthiness of the parm makes the vegetal flavors of the beans explode.  Too simple, how about the langoustine ravioli described earlier with grilled spiny lobster lightly accented by a curry served aside an aspic of uni with a fennel potato puree scented with anise.  The warmth of the ravioli and puree quickly soften the aspic releasing the creamy goodness of the uni throughout the dish.  Layer after layer of flavor.  Truly orgasmic.The ambiance is contemporary European elegance.  Stunning. The price?  Prefix menus (2, 4, 6 courses); $120 - $240.  The ultimate degustation menu (16 courses) $425 in the fall of 2011. If it sounds crazy, consider there must be more chefs in the kitchen than guest in the dining room preparing your meal.The outstanding wine list focuses on France.  Good vintage depth. Fair pricing considering the cellaring, however the average bottle price is $300.  There are few worthy selections below $100.Service is perfect.  It is executed by professionals who view service as a career.  Practiced, polished,  extremely knowledgeable of menu and culinary techniques  They are experts at making you feel like a welcome guest.  No stuffiness. Finally, remember there are things even your casino host cannot do:  provide illicit drugs, arrange "companionship" for the evening, and get a same day reservation at Joel Robuchon.  Make you reservations well in advance.Ahhh, the French really do have it right.My analysis of the myriad of glowing five star reviews:A.) This place is the default "most expensive food in Vegas" so I think it attracts people who aren't accomplished in much other then spending cash.B.) When you drop 500-1200 a person on dinner it is really hard to admit that the food and experience is less the five stars.I have enjoyed opportunities to dine at some really swanky places with prices that do command a healthy cash flow.  Joel Robuchon was by far the most overrated, unimpressive, and exorbitantly expensive meal I have ever indulged.  I guarantee if you are dropping the cash on this experience your are likely not staying at the MGM where the restaurant is located.  The MGM Grand?  Come on folks....  The place is like a goddamn amusement park and holds ranks and class with the likes of the fabulous Luxor and New York New York.  So they pick you up at your far more modern and luxurious hotel in a funky ass, old, skankafied beige limo that says "MGM Grand on the side."  Right on!  Like everyone gushes, you are rolled up to some ally entrance in the back of the hotel and are ushered in to an impressive hotel that you will NOT be staying at anytime soon.  Personally, if I was dropping 5K a night to stay at this private hotel, I would be pissed off that they shuttle some two bit strip dwellers through my private space so they can ooh and ahh while strutting through.  The whole entrance thing is complete theater, at the end of your tour you are dumped out into the reality of the MGM's casino floor area.  The hotel is old, and dumpy.  The restaurant design is classic stuffy french with a large helping of schizophrenic circus flare.  Don't be put off if the hostess, captain, and most all the wait staff put on a strange stuffiness that is not warm, nor is it directly dismissive.  It is the perfect balance of cocky that makes most general, submissive diners feel they have been blessed with the opportunity to dine.  The bread cart is a complete exhibition and a method to fill patrons up on inexpensive bread.  You won't find warm, fresh bread.  Just a bunch of gimmicky ass, stale, cold pieces of herb, cheese, and bacon bread.I ordered the full tasting menu.  In asking my options with the Sommelier, I was offered the option of three tasting costs.  Never have I been offered the option to choose my wine pairing based on cost levels.  To top it off, the price levels were some bullshit like $299, $599, or $999.  Let's just say, 300, 600, or 1000 for christ sake.I went with the most "modestly priced" wine pairing and I was blown away with the swill they poured me. The food was interesting, it was prepared well, some items were delicious however most of the 16 were just uninspired combinations of expensive ingredients.  An example was a piece of cold asparagus, cut down the middle stuffed with beluga..  Yay!  Most dishes that should have come out hot or at least warm, came out cold.  Pretty, but cold. Dessert was ridiculously long winded, as they felt the need to review two dozen little candies on yet another cart.  My share was $900.00 and I left with a huge chip on my shoulder.  Never again.I had very high expectations going in, and I was not disappointed.I've eaten at a lot of amazing places, I was raised foodie, and very little intimidates me.  But I will have to say, I was kind of on the defensive when I came here.First of all, it was a little awkward as I was dining solo.  My dinner companion had bailed on me, so I was going in on my own.  Additionally, I didn't make a reservation and just sauntered in.  Glad I had an extra sportcoat with me.  The ambiance was amazing, beautiful, exactly what I expected.  The two hostesses were tall, gorgeous women in couture dresses.  As I was mustering up courage to enter, I pulled the two huge front doors way too hard, almost causing a scene.  As I sauntered up to the stand, quickly regaining composure, I announced I would like to have dinner and didn't have a reservation.  There was some murmuring and they asked me to sit in the lounge while they spoke to the manager.  I didn't even have a chance to sit and they whisked me away to my table.I was seated on the bench side of a table for two, with a couple next to me and a third gentleman dining alone immediately next to them.  This is significant, because I couldn't help but eavesdrop, as it was so quiet in the restaurant and we were all in such close proximity.  The male half of the couple seated next to me, was on the opposite side of the table, and the bastard would not stop looking at me during my meal, which was frankly just weird and did detract from my overall experience.They asked me if I wanted a cocktail, and when I said Martini, they correctly assumed gin and asked for my preference.  I chose Hendricks and recommended they use a cucumber slice as a garnish.  The server came back with a perfect Martini in a crystal glass, and he told me that the bartender said 'thanks' for the idea of a cucumber garnish, that it paired perfectly - he said they would recommend it in the future.I started with amuse-bouche of a tomato puree served over a custard - perfect combination of flavors. I must take a moment as well to mention that the table setting was beautiful, all silver flatware, perfect china, and sparkling crystal vessels.  Whenever I would finish with a utensil or another dining implement, they would spirit away the offending dirty item to an impossibly large silver tray in the center of the room, which they would carry away only to immediately replace with another giant silver tray.  It was almost humorous when it was a lone cocktail glass.Next they arrived with a huge cart full of dozens of freshly-baked breads.  I spent half of my time just being walked through what was contained on the cart.  Not wanting to spoil my meal, I chose a modest selection, although the gentleman manning the cart was insistent that I try more.  I settled on a fresh Gruyère brioche  and a roll that had bacon within.  Then another fellow came by and engaged in a complex ritual where he carved fresh butter from Brittony with a chilled spoon and put it on my plate with a little fleur de sel.  The bread was incredible, unsurprisingly.Next up, I had the langoustine ravioli with truffle, cream and chopped cabbage.  Not only was it a delicate flavor explosion, it also had fantastic texture.  Thank goodness there were only three, because I am quite sure I could have eaten a bucket of them.  The next course was a fava bean soup served over a rosemary foam, again, flavors were incredible and there was just enough to get the flavor, but not too much.  During the meal, the service was not only incredibly attentive, but also not pretentious.  I really appreciated that.For my main course, I had a splendid duck breast with foie gras and almond-stuffed sweet and sour cherries.  Easily the most perfect duck I have ever partaken of, and the sommelier paired the perfect wine with it.  To finish the meal, I chose the Earl Grey rice krispy with raspberry milk mousse, a nice blend of sweet and tart.  I ordered some fantastic coffee and they ended with the dessert cart, where the gentleman who manned that cart foisted more and more treats upon me.  I especially loved the baba ahrum, caramels and the jellies he offered.I felt as one should after a repast like this, completely sated.  Price be damned, this is what culinary art tastes like.10 Things you should know about dining at Joel Robuchon:1) You will not be disappointed, except by the price which might make you cry.2) They send a free limo to pick you up and drop you off at the restaurant from wherever you're staying.3) Prepare yourself for at least a three hour meal. It's an experience afterall.4) They will ask if you want champagne when you sit down. Each glass is $35-$45. Water is $10/bottle for Evian.5) 16 Course Tasting Menu is $495/person without wine pairings - this is not listed on the website. Wine pairings go up to $999/person.6) Bread Cart - AMAZING. There are dozens of types of breads. The cheese breads and the milk bread was my favorite. They carve your butter from a magnificent butter mountain.7) What can I say about the food other than it was perfect. This is definitely a meal you will remember for the rest of your life. Every presentation, every flavor, every bite was absolute perfection. It was interesting and complex, unlike anything I've ever eaten before. You just have to try it. I recommend the Riz, a rice pilaf with sea urchin and lobster. It was my favorite course of the night.Every main course dish also comes with Robuchon's famous whipped potatoes. SO CREAMY!8) Mignardises is the sweets cart they offer at the end, full of chocolates and pastries. My favorites were the creme brulee and the cream puffs. 9) They give you a little present (if you're a girl) before you leave of chocolate and a booklet on the dining experience.10) If you're there for a special occasion, there is complementary cake (or gateau *pinky up*)PS Don't forget to ask them for their finest glass of Keystone Light#500My wife and I celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary here.  What a dining experience it was!  The complimentary gold MGM limo picking us up right in front of our place was sweet.  You must do this!  We were met by a beautiful hostess straight out of a James Bond film as we rolled up to the Mansion.  An amazing place to check out.  I guess this is what playing $25k a hand in blackjack gets you.  We had all intentions of getting the 16 course dinner but realized there was no chance whatsoever of my very petite sized wife having even a hail mary's shot at finishing.  She might've reached course 10 at best.  No problem!  Let's just fill up on champagne and do four courses.There are so many extremely detailed reviews for this restaurant.  Read all of them!  I'm only going to do notes and observations:- Is it possible to be too fancy?  This comes close. I love fine dining as much as the next fat Asian with glasses but the word "stuffy" came to mind.  Maybe my suit was too tight.  - The man, the myth, the legend was there.  Right before our appetizers (ah-hem! Une Entree) came out I heard a "Bon Soir!" from behind me and there he was in the flesh!  Joel Robuchon!!  He shook our hands.  Joel stops by the restaurant 4 times a year according to the staff and he said we were lucky to see him.  I should've asked Mr. Robuchon to sign one of the rolls from the ridiculously amazing bread cart.- The lobster salad with fruit was orgasmic.  - Whoever invented foie gras should go down in history as one of the greatest people ever.- Veal cheek kind of tasted like if a chicken thigh had sex with filet mignon.  I savored every little bite.  I believe the neighboring table shot me a look after I said this out loud to my wife.  Whatever.  More champagne please!!- They served us an extra dessert to celebrate the occasion.  It was the white and yellow meringue fruit pie cake I took a picture of.  I forgot what they said it was called. Blame it on the ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah-alcohol.  Tremendous stuff!  We ordered 2 more dessert dishes and THEN the dessert cart came out.  Wow!!3 hours later we were stuffed and ready for the limo to take us back.  A fantastic gourmet experience I would recommend to anyone.Went here on Christmas eve for a special celebration. Like most, I was excited to go to first 3 Michelin star restaurant. Was expected to be blown away by food and service and ambience. So not the case.FoodEverything was good but not great. Many of the delicious were mono-texture. Soft soft and more soft. No crunch no texture. Perhaps, I ordered the wrong dish but how many types of gelee and you put in your dish?Food temperature was good but not great. Famous Robuchon potatoes are delicious. Perfectly smooth and creamy. I think it should be called Robuchon butter served with a hint of potato.Bread and desert cart were awesome! What does that tell you when I remember the bread cart more than the meal. I could probably just eat the bread cart all night. You pick and choose your bread and then it is returned perfectly warm to mealt the smooth butter. But when you ask for seconds it comes back cold? Ok why heat the first batch and then just give me the second batch right off the cart? Which leads me to the next category....ServiceMichelin star rating is based on food and service they go hand in hand right? Wrong. We were seated, I went to the restroom. When I returned the host had dropped off the menu to the only guest at the table and left. No intro no explanation no welcome. Nada!The tablecloth had a big stain. Yes, a nasty chocolate like dish had smeared into the top fishnet pattern cloth so there was pieces of a meal embedded in the intersticies. Wow someone wasn't paying attention.I should have asked for the special limo and come in via the Mansion but were running late and had to get to a show. TipsWhen the waiter asks you for water expect to pay $10-20 a pop on the bill.Don't bother asking for the a la carte menu unless you want to pay $200 for an entree dish. You get a delicious piece of dark chocolate to go home with. My wife has gone to Per se (3 Michelin) and I have been to Coi (2 Michelin) and countless 1 Michelin star restaurants (Michael Mina, Gary Danko, Village Pub, Quince) and Robuchon is at the bottom of the list in terms of food, service and value. Next stop... the French Laundry.Ouch. Not for me. Plates are fixed price and ranged from $125 to $265 and if you want the complete 16 course meal it is $425. All of these prices are per person. Wow, who pays this price?  I love great restaurants but $950 for dinner for two? There has to be some value right? The food was good but not outrageous and very small portions. The desert was excellent but again very small. Both the bread cart and the desert cart were cool. Now lets talk service- stuffy, short, no excitement, no personality. How about the atmosphere? If you like a restaurant experience where everyone is eating in grandmas living room and no one wants to say a word without being scolded, this is your place. Too quiet for me.I would never go back to this place and would cringe if I had to return as a guest on a business trip.***Joel Robuchon features mostly modern French cuisine and elaborate setups (like huge bread and mignardises trollies, but the food is not as good as what you will find at high-end fine dining spots like Cyrus and The French Laundry)***Joel Robuchon is a very high-end fine dining restaurant located in the MGM Grand.  I've dined at two of Robuchon's L'atelier restaurants (one in Tokyo and one in Vegas that sits right next to Joel Robuchon).  I enjoyed both of them.  They were French restaurants, but they were not too heavy.  They were more contemporary with light preparations and lively flavors.Joel Robuchon is a more formal and traditional French spot.  There are definitely modern touches.  Joel Robuchon updates several traditional French dishes to make them more contemporary; L'atelier though utilizes more modern techniques and even fusion elements to create dishes that feel entirely new.Joel Robuchon offers several menus including an option to build your own tasting of 2-6 courses or a full tasting, which is 16 courses and an incredible amount of food.  Regardless of how many courses you opt for, there seems to be enough mini courses (like an elaborate bread cart and an extravagant mignardises trolley) to keep you from leaving hungry.With the bread cart and the mignardises trolley, I immediately thought Cyrus (a great restaurant that will be closing soon) when I dined here.  It also has similarities to The French Laundry in terms of the elaborate courses and the showcase of premium ingredients.  While I thought there were many great things about Robuchon, it was definitely not as good as those two restaurants.Part of it has to do with the produce.  I think Cyrus and The French Laundry have much better access to fresh fruits and vegetables.  The sourcing of the proteins is noticeable too.  Even though Joel Robuchon utilizes more premium ingredients than Cyrus, I felt Cyrus' proteins felt fresher and were handled with more care.  Because of this, I think the flavors pop at Cyrus and The French Laundry more.Cyrus and The French Laundry also just serve up more contemporary and interesting food.  The food feels more with the times, lighter and more creative.There were some great dishes at Robuchon though.  Caviar is nicely done here--paired with a cold and creamy cauliflower soup as well as fresh and soft hamachi sashimi.  The grilled lobster tail with herb sabayon was very good (great cooking of the lobster tail--very flavorful outside with a moist and soft inside).I liked the scallop too (nicely moist and served with a good leek curry).  The truffled langoustine ravioli was also good--nice thickness on the pasta.The caramel panna cotta, which also had a great ice cream, was very satisfying even if the garnish of strawberries was not that great.  And the attention to detail on the bread and mignardises really paid off.  The gruyere brioche was light, crispy and cheesy and the mignardises trolley featured an unbelievable amount of variety including chocolates, lollipops, little cakes, marshmallows, pate de fruit, caramels, macarons, and so on.  The best thing about it was though that despite the huge number of mignardises they make, several of them were very fresh and good.But there were definitely spots where Joel Robuchon struggled when compared to California restaurants.  Their tomato salad is supposed to be bright and vibrant as well as very modern.  Unfortunately, the tomatoes were not nearly as sweet and juicy as what you will find at Lucques (Lucques has a better flavor combination too by featuring fragrant basil and creamy burrata).  The Bazaar's caprese salad is also much more modern than Robuchon's tomato salad.Robuchon's salmon is very nicely cooked, but I didn't like the flavors of mango and mustard that they chose to go with it--both strong flavors and a little too contrasting.  The beef ribeye here was very flavorful and tender, but the garnish of capers was too overpowering.  I was excited about trying their chocolate souffle and it had a great lift, but it had a weird texture.  It was almost like a marshmallow.  It made the souffle feel dry--maybe more vanilla bean ice cream or a creme anglaise would have helped.Service was very polite, professional and attentive, but I felt it was too stiff.  It is probably just the style that they are going for, but Cyrus manages to be both formal and personable.  The dining room is very formal and high-end too.  I wasn't a big fan of all the decoration though--it made the room feel cluttered.Prices are very high, but they do serve a generous amount of food.Joel Robuchon provides a very extravagant dining experience and one that you cannot easily find elsewhere.  Still, I prefer L'atelier much more and I would highly recommend The French Laundry over it.  But it is a very renowned restaurant and worth considering if you want to try Vegas' best.MGM Grand offers both complimentary valet and self parking.Fantastique!I have been planning to go to Robuchon for a long time but never went.  Last night before seeing MGM's Crazy Horse Paris before it closes, I decided to make it a grand evening of food and entertainment.The meal.  I selected the 6 course meal.  For an amuse-bouche, they brought a bowl of avocado foam with grapefruit and apple.  Smoke was coming out from the sides of the bowl from a couple of pieces of dry ice concealed in the lower section.  The bowl was sitting on a plate that had apples all over it.  The smoking bowl and the apple plate went with the restaurant's fall theme.  It was very pleasing to the eye and to the palate.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0HgBefore the first course, the server came with the bread cart.  I chose a bacon bread and a basil roll.  He took them away to be warmed and while they were being warmed, he pulled a nice curl of butter from the large bell shaped mound of butter.  On this curl, he spooned some coarse sea salt.  Perfect!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#cG0hupMF2hno9oNJFQzTFAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#vhZqX8iJde17fytPkzjdYgThe first course was spiced lobster in a cold cauliflower soup with botargo shavings.  This was excellent.  The lobster and the cauliflower made a good combination.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#qEPSaCG4mph3gwtwMSCgkASecond course was a pumpkin velouté with foie gras, ginger foam, and toasted seeds.  The pumpkin velouté was poured into the foam from a separate container by the server.  There were also small cubes of pumpkin for texture in the velouté.  Very tasty pumpkin flavor with the lovely ginger to add an extra layer of flavor.  The foie gras was superb!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#Yoc7fLdK93DmTfocE3vS2gFor the third course, I went back to lobster.  I got the spiny lobster served with yucca root in a green curry with fresh coriander.  Another winner.  Very good.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#vMMAmXsQT8J7zxTXCmYRqAFor the fourth course, I chose a special that wasn't on the menu.  They had lamb chops and lamb loin.  It was very flavorful.  With this course, they brought some pommes purée and a finger bowl with a slice of lemon and one rose petal.  After all, you have to clean your fingers after picking up the lamb chop to finish the meat from the bone.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#anOfKURZUpLKafsNDbh6ewhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#QtU_80wjNrJZwFrVkYQpOghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#zFf11ODymwTGaz2wovhjiAThe 5th course was the cheese course.  By now, I was feeling full and I knew there were more good things to come.  I chose three cheeses--some bleu, a French hard cheese similar to manchego, and a soft sheep's milk cheese.  All three were good, but the bleu was outstanding!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#1ZeLTWxdkqNNrSQ0cK09zwWith the cheese course, you were brought a raisin roll.  It really adds to the cheese flavors.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#zAdat0jo4ZV4Z5YH-fhq9QFor the last course, dessert, I ordered the pistachio mousse glazed with chocolate ganache and raspberry gelée.  Heavenly, rich, dark chocolate!!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#XqZUNyWMVX8_poZCZExiMwLast, the mignardises trolley was wheeled to the table. Wow.  Such a choice.  I took three, a dark chocolate demi-macaron, a vanilla macaron, and a small tartlet with raspberry and cream.  What a delightful way to end a meal and now I was very full.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joël-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#wf4xOVg4-mfqu0liI7xk6QService was exemplary!  There wasn't one staff member who wasn't polite and who didn't have a smile.  The whole package--the food, the fall theme with the flowers of reds and oranges, the plates with apples and pumpkins, the service and the general ambience of this quiet, elegant restaurant--makes for a fine dining experience.  I'd love to go back and try the 14 course menu but I'm afraid I couldn't eat that much. Thanks to my Yelp friends who encouraged me to go here and gave me pointers, especially Rod and Marcus!i have too many wonderful things to say about this restaurant!  where do i start....when i first walked it, it was not what i expected.  they have the bar area to the right and it is really dark and small.  the chairs seem too large for the tables.  the sommelier happened to be there as i was selecting a glass of wine and let me try a sample of the shiraz.  i opted for the pinot noir which was light and smooth.  we were seated almost immediately.  we sat at a table in the "garden" area to the right of the dining room.  it's a very quaint and romantic spot (too bad i was dining with my boss!).  if you are going on a romantic date or celebrating an anniversary, ask for a table in the garden.i won't say too much about service, but it was impeccable.  we had about 3-4 people attending to us throughout the meal and each one was polite and helpful.  they would even wait for us to finish our conversation before interrupting.the food.  do not expect to come in here and spend less than $200/person (including drinks/etc).  they have different meal options for you to choose from with the smallest option starting at $129.  they have a 16 course meal for $485/person.  i opted for an app + entree, which was $169.  first off, their bread is to die for.  they have 2 types of bread with cheese and i tried one of each.  they have tons of other bread, even ones with bacon.  they warm the bread up for you and it's so good.  they give you butter from france with sea salt and olive oil, but the bread is so yummy on its own, you do not need to add anything to it.i started with the foie gras and artichoke salad.  it was uh-mazing!  the foie gras melted in your mouth and the artichoke had a great marinade. for my entree, it was a no brainer - i had the spaghetti with sea urchin and caviar.  it was an additional supplement of around $40, i believe, but it was worth every penny!  they give you 4 pieces of sea urchin, a soft boiled egg and caviar sprinkled on top.  the spaghetti sauce was so creamy and buttery - i have no words.  amazing.they give you a side of the chef's mashed potatoes.  the waiter said, and i quote "i hope you like butter".  nuff said.this is an amazing dining experience.  it's definitely not an every day meal, but given a reason, i'd come back in a heart beat!I'm sorry. I tried. I really did. But Joël Robuchon fell short. Very short. Please let me preface this by stating, in my opinion no meal, unless you choose it to be so, should be four hours long. And, let me state that my rating takes in to consideration the "experience" of dining at Joël Robuchon, which reaches beyond the food itself.My wife and I celebrated our 20 year anniversary by a trip to what may be considered the best restaurant in Las Vegas, or possibly the country. It started off with a bang and initially, I was truly enjoying the experience. We arrived and were promptly seated. I was surprised by the size of the restaurant as it was quite small, which was very nice actually. The quaintness of the size kept the sound down and made the experience much more personal. And, the design of the restaurant was contemporary and modern without being too over the top "mod" like many other Vegas eateries.One issue to note that was a arguing point with my wife and I was the strict dress policy for gentleman. Jacket and tie are required. No big deal. Happy to put it on for the anniversary. However, when I dine, I prefer not to wear a tie, like most men. I had a very nice suit and shirt, but knowing Las Vegas, I preferred not to wear a tie. My wife insisted so I begrudgingly put a tie on.Again, "jacket and tie are required" to me means just that. As we walk in, there were many men dressed well in jacket and tie, sitting right next to other couples who's men were wearing jeans, sports coat with open collared, button down shirt with a t-shirt underneath.Point: If you have a dress code, enforce it or why even bother.Service began very attentively and the pacing was fantastic. The menu was described well and we were enjoying the experience. The pace of the meal is important to me and everything was going well. Drinks were ordered, wine with assistance of the sommelier, our dining selection made, all is well with the world. The bread and courses began. The bread selection was impressive and the knowledge of the waitstaff impressive. Everything was amazing. Pre appetizer, appetizer, soup, wine, cocktails, mineral water, water, music, perfect. Presentation was artistically superb.And then, something happened. Maybe a shift change (joke) or possibly the world started rotating backwards? Time space continuum shift? Who knows. While waiting for our main course, the service came to a crawl. Attentive still but very, very slow. It took 45 mins before our last appetizer and our main courses to arrive.I ordered the Beef Cheeks as I was feeling like having beef. They arrived nicely appointed. Slicing into them they were very tender, in a miso based sauce. The problem immediately was taste. It literally tasted like my mothers pot roast. This couldn't be so I tried again. And sure enough, mom's pot roast. I asked my wife if she wanted to try as I explained my dilemma. And sure enough, I could see the disappointment on her face as everything else had been so delightful.Ok, one bad dish, albeit the main course, I'm willing to overlook it. However, we're now stuck with this issue with service. It's getting slower and slower and slower. The pace between the next few courses was just painfull. Time between our main course and dessert was another 45 mins. Then our anniversary cake. Then we were politely told that the dessert tray needed to be replenished. Very politely and with courtesy, but we'd already had been there for three hours and I was getting testy.The dessert tray was a work of art and the man in charge of them extremely knowledgeable. They were fantastic as well.One thing to note. I ordered sparkling mineral water and my glass barely had a sip out of it and it was refreshed by the wait staff. Fantastic! However, once it was empty, the bottle removed but I remained thirsty. I had to ask for water three times. Each time it came promptly but being thirsty, I drank it and i had to again ask for it to be refilled. Additionally, I enjoy cold water. This water was room temperature. No problem. I'll just request ice water, which I did and I still got the same room temperature water.Post meal, a nice little bag was given with a great brochure recapping our meal which was a nice touch. Then our check came in a very timely manner, which was as expected. So, what is my main complaint? No complaint actually. More of a disappointment really. My low rating was purely based on meeting expectations for a well rounded dining experience supposedly one of the best in the country. I expected a world class experience and didn't get it. I felt the pacing of the meal started out perfectly, after the main course however, I'm unsure as to what happened. The main course was a disappointment.The wait staff delightful and extremely knowledgeable and very friendly.Overall, my wife enjoyed it very much and that's all that matters. ;)~Went there on June 2012, and this horrible dinner is still seared in my mind & it was so disappointing because I planned our entire anniversary trip around this dinner. The most ahhhmazing part was when the car rolled up to the villa and the gates parted and than you are ushered into this plush, decadent restaurant. I should have known something was up since it was so easy to get reservation. We ordered the Menu A $250 per person. It was so bad that after the third course, my BF said he had enough and wanted to go eat something that's edible, but being Chinese I insisted we trudge on through as to not let food go to waste. The alcohol drink we ordered was nasty too. Short Review: Save your money, don't go here! Unremarkable food, paired with bad service. Long Review:Here's what we ordered:1A) Green Asparagus...What a joke, anybody could have made it, no creativity to it.1B) Spiced Lobster...My fave dish that night, but I'm partial to lobster.2A) Green Pea Cream Soup...Good, but not memorable.2B) Light Daikon soup...Good, but not memorable. 3A) Pan Fried Sea Bass...Fish was fresh, but not memorable. (A running theme of Robuchon.)3B) Grilled Spiny Lobster...Came out cold. I asked the Waiter, if this is normal, he said he will check with the kitchen and redo it. When he came back with the new dish, he made a jeering remark to the gist of, "Next time, don't take so long to take photos." WTF? Taking a couple of shots is not long enough to turn a dish cold.Than came the longest wait in the world for the fourth course. WE WAITED ALMOST AN HOUR FOR THE NEXT COURSE. Nobody came to apologize. There is no way that they didn't know about this because an integral part of fine dining is the timing of the dishes of when they are served.  4A) Roasted duck...Okay.4B) Beef cheeks...It was very tender, but the sauce was average. The Mashed Potatoes. It was ahhhmazing. If this was the only course served, than Joel deserves 5 stars. Just give me a bucket of this and I am a happy camper.  5) Instead of Cheese Course we requested a substitute and they gave us the Risotto of Soybeans Sprouts. It was so salty...inedible. At that time, I was too afraid to say anything, lest I get another reprimand from the waiter. The waiter didn't even bother asking why we didn't finish the course. 6A) La Fraise: Nasty tasting, served in a tacky serve ware. 6B) Le Chocolat: Also nasty, and tacky looking, why is there peacock feathers surrounding it?Than while we are eating our desserts, strangely they appeared with a cake, say happy anniversary, than walked off. Nice gesture, but the entire event was strange.  They will serve you a slice and the rest of the cake is thrown away. What a waste.At the end of the meal, they roll out this beautiful dessert cart and tell you choose whatever mignardises you want. However, you are not allowed to take any of it to go. Huh? What kind of policy is this, I never had happened to me at a fine dining establishment. By that time, after this long drawn ordeal, I'm tired, my BF pissed. I randomly chose a few to try, but still you wouldn't want to take these home, even if you could. Verdict: Save your time and money and go splurge elsewhere.IMPECCABLE.  Food, service, staff, ambiance...everything was just impeccable.We chose the 6 course dinner each and we were there from 5:30pm to 10:30pm.-The L'Amuse-bouche:  a small bite that excited my palate.Bread cart approached me and oh how I tried to so hard to limit myself to 3...we were given olive oil and salt sprinkled butter to enjoy with the bread.-Soup: Delicate tofu velouté with lemon zest on warm seaweed gelée, smoked and caramelized eel.  This has layers and layers of flavor.-Appetizer: langoustine ravioli with truffle, cream and chopped cabbage-1st Main Course: Black Cod with a yuzu daikon velvet puree**after the 1st main course, I was pretty full.-2nd Main Course: Duck and seared foie gras with sweet and sour cherries, fresh almonds.  This dish was very delicious, but again, I was full at this point, I could not finish my plate.  I still had a piece of foie gras, and almost 2 pieces of duck left...I had to tap out.**we ordered some hot tea to help us stay awake.  When we were ready, the cheese cart came by.-Fromage:  So many different cheese!  Our awesome server brought out some fruits for us to enjoy with the cheese.  He was also kind enough to write down our favorite cheese on a piece of paper for our future reference.-Dessert 1: Strawberry Daiquiri with yogurt sorbet and pop rocks - yummy yummy joy joy for my tummy.  Who knew pop rocks will elevate such dessert...GENIUS.  I loved it.-Dessert 2:Raspberry milk mousse, spiced raspberry sorbet, earl grey puffed rice krispies and pistachio foam.  Ahhh, the pop rocks...oh wait, I was going to write about the Dessert 2...it was different.-Mignardises: Finally, the dessert cart.  Unlimited amount of macarons..all the items on this cart was just delicious.  Our server knew how stuffed we were so he packed us two small boxes filled with delicious chocolate delights in them.Before we left, they gave us a gift bag with the menu, rosemary bread, and a booklet of Joel Robuchon Restaurant, with Chef''s bio, menus, etc.Joel Robuchon at MGM Grand has to be the #1 Restaurant on my list.Visit three, Items experienced:Le Coeur Rouge - Pomegranate Juice, Muddled Orange and Cherry, SpriteLe Maize - Corn Veloute, Honey and Ginger Crouton, Smoked Duck, Milk MarshmallowBread Service: Mini Baguette, Yeast Bun, Mini Croissant, Gruyere Brioche, Potato Bread, Comte Baguette, Rustic Loaf, Saffron Focaccia, Milk Bread, Bacon with Whole Grain Mustard, Traditional Baguette, Olive Baguette, Basil Focaccia, Brioche with Roasted Sea Salt, French Butter with Sea Salt and Olive OilLe Foie Gras - Carpaccio of Foie Gras and Potatoes Covered with Black Truffle ShavingsLe Kabocha - Kabocha Pumpkin Veloute with Foie Gras, Ginger Foam, Toasted SeedsLes Spaghettis - Homemade Spaghetti Topped with Soft Boiled Egg, Urchin, CaviarLa Pintade Fermiere - French Hen with Roasted Foie Gras, Confit Potatoes au JusCheese Course with Raisin roll, Wildflower honey; Haystack Peak, Cremont, 2 Year Comte, Tomme de Brebis, Pont l'evequeLe Ruby - Raspberry Dome on Mascarpone Cream, Cranberries, Cranberry Coulis, Japanese YogurtLe Chocolat - Apple Compote infused with Hibiscus, topped with Chocolate Tuille, Dark Chocolate Sorbet, Gold LeafPetit Fours - Pineapple Financier, Vanilla Macaron, Passionfruit Marshmallow, Apple Cupcake with Caramel Icing, Religeuse, Pear Gelee, Almond Cluster, Cinnamon Meringue, Chocolate Caramels,  Hazelnut/Rum/Banana/Chinese Five Spice Milk Chocolate, Yuzu/Pistachio/Coffee/Passionfruit Dark Chocolate, Coffee Opera Cake, Mango Tarte, Coffee Éclair, Pineapple Tart, Nougat, Blueberry White Chocolate, Citrus Tuille, Hazelnut Bon-Bon, Lemon Tartelette, Dark Chocolate Macaron, Orange Lollipop, Guava Pate a Fruit, Canale, Mini Chocolate Hazelnut Tart, Crème Brulee, Panna CottaOrange Sorbet, Caramel Ice Cream, Orange Spice, Anise, Ginger, Caramel Drizzle CakeTake home gift - Raspberry and Pistachio Pound Cake...while some may believe that one cannot buy class, in Las Vegas I'm rather certain that one can buy a close semblance to anything, a fact evidenced by the t-shirt and track suit clad group sitting a few tables down from me as the clock turned to Christmas 2012 while I enjoyed a complimentary piece of Orange Ice cream cake that pastry chef Kamel Guechida had crafted for the questionably clad but clearly affluent Europeans who were celebrating a birthday in addition to the holidays at Vegas' most glitzy restaurant.  Having already dined at Joel Robuchon twice myself this was not the first time I'd seen such generosity from the kitchen of "The Chef of the Century" and much like my previous visits the meal was an exercise in refinement; the room, the food, and the service all well-manicured, highly polished, and lavish.Taking a 9:00pm reservation and arriving early only to be identified by name as the doors swung open on my approach I was subsequently seated at the same table I'd dined at during my first visit and greeted by a familiar service team including the same dining room manager and server as my prior visit much of what would follow was familiar; the plethoric bread cart and equally impressive cheese course followed by a dessert trolley with nearly three dozen options plus the signature pound cake, though this time smaller than prior.  Deferring on coffee I was additionally treated to a hand clipped tea and infusions cart and a $10 flat charge brought no less than three bottles of Evian - no doubt the cost of admission warrants these things as well as the impressive "Ruby" palate cleanser and "Maize" amuse - gifts that would constitute proper courses at many restaurants.Moving on to what was ordered I once again opted to order from the prix fixe as opposed to the larger grand tasting and making a special request for the (menu price $300 if ordered ALC) Pintade Fermiere my only small complaint regarding the entire evening was that Chef Le Tohic felt need to visit my table before the hen's preparation to suggest I'd be better off only ordering half the bird as I'd have gladly (and greedily,) eaten more of the crispy skin and supple flesh sandwiched around thick, buttery, foie gras...though I guess saving the $60 supplement charge was a benefit.Truffles, foie gras, uni, foie gras, caviar, and more foie gras plus aged comte, spell-binding desserts, and a room and service beyond reproach I can think of much worse ways to celebrate Christmas Eve than with Joel Robuchon's team at the MGM and although I personally would never do so in a T-shirt there is something refreshing about the fact that in a city where there are so many bad high-stakes bets this is a place where anyone willing and able to spend the money is virtually guaranteed an excellent return.There is absolutely no reason to go to Joel Robuchon unless you're curious about what it's like to spend a lot of money for hit-or-miss food and service that does not resemble a 3-star Michelin restaurant in the slightest.I've eaten at L'Atelier Joel Robuchon in both Paris and LV.  I very much enjoyed both experiences.  I didn't feel like I over-spent for those experiences.  In fairness, I knew ahead of time that spending $435 for a 16-course tasting menu would probably be disappointing, because how could it not? It's $435 for a meal.  I was, however, hoping I might find something over the course of 3 hours to justify it.  The food: Within the 16 courses, I enjoyed the Le Caviar trio, the La Saint-Jacques (pan seared sea scallop), the Les Crustaces trio (crab and sea urchin, and I didn't actually like the sea urchin dish), Le Boeuf, and both desserts.  My sea bass was overcooked, and the foie gras in broth was one of the worst preparations of foie gras I've tasted; it was umami done wrong.  (L'Atelier has much better preparations.) The bread and sweets were pretty good, however.  But for $435 I should be lauding this place.  I had a better tasting menu at The Pass (non-Michelin rated) in Houston, and a better experience with service.The service: It made me question the last time Joel Robuchon was reviewed by the Michelin Guide.  There was no finesse or fluidity to service.  I was privy to loud whispers between waitstaff.  The bread tray was constantly hitting the back of where I was sitting on its way to-and-fro.  And, to top it off, when a waiter picked up the signed check from the patron to my left (who, admittedly, got a little snippy with waitstaff), I could see him roll his eyes and huff upon looking at the check.  As a diner, I should not see any of this at any Michelin rated restaurant, let alone a 3-star.  Look, all this Michelin star restaurant stuff can get  pretentious.  I keep exclaiming about it because I'm beginning to think the emperor has no clothes with a lot of these restaurants.  In particular, Joel Robuchon.  But I would go to either L'Atelier again.Joël Robuchon was the choice for the girlfriend and my dinner on our first night in Vegas.  While there were plenty of other, much less expensive, restaurants I could've taken my girlfriend, unbeknownst to her, I planned to propose to her over dinner and the occasion called for something special.  Upon stepping through the door and up until we left several hours later, Joël Robuchon exuded style, class, opulence, and Franco/Vegas charm in all facets of its operation. We elected to have the 16 (or so)-course degustation menu.  The team of wait staff was off the charts with its informed, surgically precise, personable, but never "stuffy" service throughout our meal.  Likewise, the sommelier was spot on with her wine recommendations (we had two splits, one white and one red), which were surprisingly affordable and very well suited complements to the varied courses of food received.Our meal started off with a bread cart, which was more aptly described as a boulangerie on wheels.  Every type of French style bread or roll was present and was served with amazingly creamy butter and an exotic sea salt.  After the bread, came our culinary Tour de Force.  We received the following...La Cerise - Cherry gazpacho with pistachios and ricotta ice creamLa Tomate - Salad of tomato with basil infused olive oil, tomato gelée topped with mozzarella  Le Caviar - Red turnip and radish with yellowtail carpaccio, delicate cream of corn, caviar on a fennel cream served as a surpriseLa Saint-Jacques - Pan seared sea scallop in green curry and fresh corianderLes Crustacés - Truffled langoustine ravioli, Sea urchin prepared in "chaud-froid" with anise juices, spiny lobster served atop spinach in a black Malabar pepper sauceLes Petits Pois - Sweet green pea veloute with vegetable aroma and hints of mintLe Foie Gras - Seared foie gras with red berries and kumquat compoteLe Bar - Pan-fried sea bass with a lemon grass foam and stewed baby leeksLe Boeuf - Grilled beef rib-eye, black olive and bone marrow condimentLe Broccolini - Broccollini and soybean sprouts cooked as a risottoLe Pop-Fraise - Fresh strawberries and strawberry mousse with Rosé Champagne cream and soursop sorbetLe Dome - Black fruits on a delicate chocolate fondant and dolce.Our meal closed with the Le Moka-Le Thé, a cart filled with over 35 different Mignardises.  It was the proverbial sweet finale to an amazing meal!  Every course was beautiful in its presentation, but easily matched by the complex, yet exquisite flavors delivered with every bite.  In truth, I can't pick a favorite course since they were each amazing in their own unique way.  It was definitely not traditional French bistro fare.  Joël Robuchon was the perfect choice for our most special occasion.  I highly recommend it for yours.  And if you were still wondering...she did say, "Yes".Not sure what else I can add to all the great reviews this joint has gotten, but here goes nothing. We ordered the 17 course tasting menu. I won't go over each course, but trust me when I say that they were all virtually flawless. I will, however, highlight my favorite parts of this dining experience.The service - impeccable and efficient. I've never seen a machine work so smoothly. The front and back waiters were exceptionally knowledgeable, warm and friendly. The only snootiness I detected was from the suited up captain. Luckily, all he did was present us with the menus and take our order.The Bread cart - outrageous and extravagant. Hands down, the best bread I've ever had.The butter - yes. You read correctly. The butter is imported from Brittany and had such a smooth, creamy texture and an almost yeasty, cheese-like taste.The caviar course - hamachi with baby radish, olive oil and lemon; corn pudding with cream; crab salad served in a caviar tin...all topped with golden osetra caviar. Nuff said.The cheese cart - they import their cheese from France (illegally I guess) and you can tell. I've never had cheese like this before. If there is ever a time to say OMG about anything, this is it. OH EM GEE.Again, not to disparage the other courses, but in the interest of time and nonboredomness (?), those were my favorites. A once in a lifetime meal.There is no question or doubt in my mind that Joël Robuchon deserves nothing less than five stars and is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.My company was hosting its annual holiday Vegas vacation, so I knew I wanted to dine somewhere nice as I rarely ever get the chance to when in Sin City with friends (typical meals include McDonald's, Earl's, and a buffet). I made reservations easily on the phone a month in advance and inquired about the complimentary limo service. I was told to call back 7-days before my dinner reservation to reserve. I called back 6-days before and was told there was no availability and was put on a waiting list. So when they say to call a week in advance, you better call a week in advance.Our party of four didn't end up getting limo service or The Mansion tour, but Joël Robuchon is truly a beautiful restaurant and amazing enough on its own. Our jaws dropped in awe from the opulent décor, grandiose chandelier, and elegant royal purple theme. The ambiance is lovely, romantic, and simply stunning.LibationsMoscato ($15)Chivas Regal 18 Year ($20)Evian water bottles ($10 each)Amuse-BoucheRed Beet Gazpacho with Burrata, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#3oWOowMNY6iN_soX-Eah_QBread Servicehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7AThe bread cart was intense, with more than 10 different selections to choose from.4-course Prix Fixe Menu ($198 pp)Le Homard, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#M31VHoxg2XlA8imP1e9v0ALe Navet Rouge, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#Hm5SMsybvCM270IRJd_uVwLe Champignon Paris (suppl. $65), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#dKGS7p4_0ODNfM6paeJr4ALa Langoustine (suppl. $35), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#ZEUpkrMTmO2BU2UKkNYxJQLe Bar, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#O3RixLub7PnheTlMKKWNAgLa Langouste, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#T8m9o_Ti8yuRziwn9WwY7ALe Bœuf, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#0k-Ci5zOxqTBKduWc_llgwLa Sphère, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#EyRsCosnHxDKeZJhT9z4EQLes Herbes, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#ReJ-UiMju0OZkN-hSIz7qQLe Soufflé (suppl. $15), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#dUlLKBG9VWN0Ag1gKGKHUgMignardiseshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#BtWcKw5jrQKx8nNcMLUfjAThe mignardises cart was equally as impressive and stunning as the bread cart. There were over 20 selections of different sweet treats to choose from; it was pretty overwhelming. I wish I could've tried everything but I really didn't want to look like a fatty. My favorites from the cart were the canelés and macarons.Everything was delicious. The appetizers, the mains, the desserts, everything. I've been to 1- and 2-Michelin-star restaurants before, and now I finally know that that one extra star truly does make a difference. Le Homard (spiced lobster) was my favorite appetizer, followed by Le Navet Rouge (scallops). For my main, I ordered Le Bar (grilled sea bass), which was good but lost the round to La Langouste (spiny lobster) and Le Bœuf (braised beef cheeks). If I were to go back again, I'd definitely get the the beef cheeks; they were so tender and flavorful. Dessert was amazing -- if you're ordering any, you must get La Sphère, a bubble sugar sphere filled with blueberries, yogurt sorbet, candied lemon, and violet cream. It was so pretty and made my sweet tooth very happy. Le Soufflé is also a must! Not too sweet, not too bitter, it went terrifically well with the vanilla ice cream it was served with. Perfect ending to a fantastic dinner. I would have to say however, both the amuse-bouche and mignardises were fairly mediocre when compared to the rest.Service was good. Our water glasses were constantly refilled (explains how we ended up with a $40 tab on water alone), timing between courses was perfect (though there was a little hiccup between our last dessert course and mignardises), and while the staff was supremely attentive, they were also generally unobtrusive.After our meal ended, the ladies in our group were each presented with a giant loaf of bread in a purple gift bag. If your meal doesn't fill you up, this bread definitely will.Michelin: 3 stars (2009)Can't believe that I've written 399 reviews already. To celebrate the 400th review, I saved it for one of the best meals/experience I ever had. Its no wonder the man is named Chef of the Century. His namesake restaurant incorporates attention to food and service like no other restaurant I've been to. After reading reviews from fellow yelpers, I knew I had to call a week ahead to ask for a limo reservation.  On the night of our reservation, a gold limo came to pick us up at the Mandalay Bay. It drove us to the MGM and dropped us off right in front of the secret entrance to the MGM residences in the back of the hotel. We got a quick glimpse of the place as we walked through it. The garden courtyard, looked like an outdoor garden, was actually indoors. Our hostess told us a night in one of these rooms start at $10K. I guess I'll just stick with the free walkthrough of the place instead. The walkthrough eventually leads us back to the general public casino of the MGM, right next to Joel Robuchon and L'Atelier. Our hostess took our coats and brought stools for all the ladies' purses. Our servers quickly brought us menus and took our drink orders. Once all our orders were taken, the magic began! First up was the butter and olive oil cart. Prepared tableside, the server scrapes two layers of butter and sprinkles fleur de sel on it carefully. He explained that the butter was from Britain. Next he pours olive oil from spain into small bowls. Next up was the bread cart! I think I ate about 6 or 7 different kinds of bread. I already told myself not to eat too much in order to save room for the rest of the meal, but the bread was just so irresistible! My faves were the Milk bread, Basil bread, Bacon bread, Croissant and the Cheese brioche (in no particular order). The first time they bring the bread cart around to take everyone's order, they'll actually bring the bread back to the kitchen to warm it up. Afterwards, they just bring an assorted tray around to see if anyone wants more bread. The ones on the tray don't get warmed up! They came by 4 times to offer us more bread throughout the meal. Our amuse bouche for the night was beets soup with marscapone cheese. I don't like beets, but even I found this to be quite delicious! The presentation and choice of serving ware was spot on. For the appetizer, I had the Lobster with truffle. It came with three huge pieces of perfectly cooked lobster, topped with three big pieces of winter truffles. The sauce complimented the lobster perfectly without overpowering the flavor of the truffles. The next appetizer I had was the Crispy soft boiled egg with truffles. The egg was perfect, with yolk slowly oozing out as you cut into it! For my entree, I had the chicken with foie gras. This dish required an extra supplement, which I think is totally worth it since California no longer has foie gras available. The chicken and foie gras come served in a big pot, and is presented to you tableside as the server carefully plates the contents onto a plate for you. The chicken was so juicy and moist, and the foie gras was so rich. My only complaint was that the sauce was a bit salty for my taste. For dessert, I had the Herb sorbet with sabayon. This was the perfect palate cleanser. So refreshing yet the perfect sweet ending to the meal. One of my friends ordered the sugar sphere with orange mousse. This was an amazing presentation. The clear and shiny sphere of sugar was filled with orange mousse. It was really too beautiful to crack open to eat! And of course the best part of the meal, the dessert cart, comes to finish off our experience here. The cart has over 40 things. By the time the server went through everything on the cart, I already forgot what were the items he mentioned in the beginning. But he was so patient with us and answered our questions as we pointed and asked him what certain items were again and again. The cart has small candies and chocolates, to french macarons, to lollipops and marshmallows, to even small desserts (creme brulee, panna cotta). I felt like a little kid in a candy store! My favorite items were the yuzu truffle, the blueberry cheesecake bite, and the pineapple pop. Before our meal came to an end, the server brought all the ladies at the table a gift bag. It came with a loaf of cake and a glossy picture book of the dishes at the restaurant (some of them were the ones we ate). When we were about ready to go, we let the hostess know for her to get the limo ready. Once the limo arrived, she walked us back through the MGM residences to our limo which took us back to the Mandalay Bay. Overall, this place is worth every single penny. The experience as a whole was flawless. Service was spot on, food was beyond expectations, and presentation of everything was a masterpiece. Every dish looked too beautiful to eat! I definitely will be coming back to try the 16 course!***Joel Robuchon is considered by some as one of the best restaurants in the U.S.; I think the food here is good and the bread and mignardises trolleys provide a luxurious abundance you just cannot get elsewhere, but I actually prefer L'atelier de Joel Robuchon next door; that Robuchon restaurant serves much more contemporary, creative, vibrant, and lighter French cuisine***Because of its three Michelin stars rating (back when Michelin used to rate Vegas restaurants), Joel Robuchon is a restaurant many seek out for a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience.  I dined at Joel Robuchon a few years ago and I thought it was good but not as good as other great high-end restaurants I have tried in San Francisco and Chicago (I would also put it below the two L'atelier de Joel Robuchon restaurants I have tried--one in Vegas and another in Tokyo).As good as Michelin is at selecting truly special restaurants, it still gives a little too much praise to restaurants from legendary French chefs like Joel Robuchon, Guy Savoy and Jean-Georges Vongerichten.  For me, these acclaimed French restaurants feel like places where the celebrity chef is not really there that often.  In addition, the food at these French spots just feel outdated and heavy and nowhere near as exciting as the progressive cuisine that restaurants like Manresa, Saison, wd~50, and Graham Elliot serve.I did think the bread trolley and mignardises trolleys at Joel Robuchon on my first visit were very exceptional--both of these trolleys did deliver the kind of great flavors and textures as well as luxurious presentation that you just cannot find elsewhere (even at great restaurants).  My first trip to Joel Robuchon was for their tasting menu and it was way too much food and it kind of dulled the experience.My dinner the second time around was a smaller set menu and it actually resulted in a more enjoyable experience even if the food was nowhere near the quality and creativity of The French Laundry or Quince.Dinner started with a refreshing gazpacho served with creamy burrata and really good extra virgin olive oil.  Next up was a good salad of leafy greens, artichokes, shaved foie gras torchon (creamy, savory and meaty), crostini, and shaved Parmesan.A warm, sweet and velvety kabocha veolute was the next course.  It was garnished with really good roasted chestnuts, mushrooms and truffle.The fish course was smoked and then roasted black cod.  The fish flaked very nicely and easily.  The fish was very soft and moist.  I enjoyed the light eggplant puree sauce that the fish sat in; the eggplant puree sauce was brightened up by good yuzu.  The fish was topped with good asparagus.The meat course was a braised beef cheek wrapped in pasta; it was served with nicely braised winter vegetables, red miso and ginger.  The beef cheek was good; it was very savory, juicy, tender, and quite rich.  The beef cheek was finished off with Joel Robuchon's signature mashed potatoes, which were rich, buttery, thick, smooth, and creamy (the staff at all of Robuchon's restaurants tout this side and it is very memorable for such a simple starch).Dessert was a fragrant green chartreuse sabayon with refreshing herb sherbet and a nice hazelnut praline at the bottom (mostly sweet but also a little bit salty and a great crispy, wafer-like consistency).The dinner ended with some good mignardises of mini macarons, chocolates, truffles, pate de fruit, and canele.Service was very good--professional and polite but also friendly (I felt the service was much more personable on this visit).The dining room has kind of an over-the-top luxurious look with purple contrasting strongly with black as well as chandeliers.Prices are very high (even for Vegas standards), but there are a few menu options including the ability to get just 3 or 4 courses; this might be more than enough food given the generous amount of complimentary breads and mignardises served here.I enjoyed my experience at Joel Robuchon more this time because the food felt a lot lighter.  Still, the food at Joel Robuchon feels dated in parts and for a high-end French restaurant, I prefer the more modern but still classically French Melisse in LA or the French seafood restaurant Le Bernardin where the seafood and sauces both really stand out (even if the food feels slightly dated there too).  If Joel Robuchon is one you have been wanting to try for a long time, I would say that it is worth a try though I would opt for one of their less expensive menus.If you are just looking for a really good French restaurant, I would suggest L'atelier de Joel Robuchon next door, which serves French cuisine very much inspired by classic French dishes but also with a lighter, more vibrant, more contemporary, and more creative style.Joel Robuchon is located in the MGM Grand.  Like other major hotels and casinos on The Strip, the MGM Grand offers both complimentary valet and self parking.Our awesome butler at the Skylofts got us last minute reservations here on Valentine's Day weekend.  Joel Robuchon has been on our list of restaurants to try and it did not disappoint, this is fine dining at its best :)Ambiance: 5 stars, the decor is classy, full of dark purple plush sofas and chandeliers with orchids everywhere.  It's very romantic :)Service: 5 stars, from start to finish the wait staff was on hand and was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menuFood:-Bread Cart: OMG this bread trolley...I can just eat from this and this alone.  There are dozens of selections from bacon bread, classic baguettes, cheese bread etc. Go for the bacon bread!-Amuse bouche: a cold beet concoction that was supposed to wake up your pallet; it actually did! -First course: Spicy Lobster with caviar, this dish was decadent and the lobster was so fresh and juicy! They also put real 24k gold flakes in there...lol..fancy fancy.                     Pumpkin soup: tiny portion but it was flavorful-Second course: Beef cheeks: Tender and delicious, and the whipped potatoes they served with it was so good!!                    Pork with truffles: This dish was a tad salty -Dessert: Their dessert cart was out of this world.  If you like sweets you will NOT be disappointed!  I highly recommend the dark chocolate truffles, the macaroons...actually just try anything that catches your eye hahaOverall: 5 stars!  The price for the 3 course was $169, we both had the 3 course with some wine and our dinner bill was around $500.  It was worth every penny though! The price for the 16 course was over $400 a person, however, the older couple next to us had the 16 course and they assured us it was divine.  We will probably try that next time for a special occasion.Location: In the MGM Grand next to KA.  I heard if you are staying at another hotel you can arrange for a gold limo to come pick you up in case you want to feel like a baller :)The 16 course tasting menu was "Heaven on Earth"! My wife and I were felt taken care from beginning to end.  The entire Joel Robuchon experience began with the complimentary limo ride from our Hotel.  As you depart your limo to the private entrance of  "The Mansion" at MGM, you are greeted by several members of the staff.  The first thing you notice is the attention to detail.  One staff member's responsibility is to escort you as you travel from The Mansion through the secluded entrance of the hotel to Joel Robuchon.  There are nice "handoffs" between members of their staff, so you always feel like you're being taken care of. We had a 6:00pm reservation, and when we arrived we were seated immediately.  When I had made my reservation, I had indicated that we were celebrating my Wife's birthday and I requested a private corner table.  To my splendid surprise, they were able to accommodate and we were seated in one of the dining rooms off to the side of the main dining room.  The decor was very beautiful!  There were ivy plants growing along the tall wall and a large bed of flowers. Now...on to the food. I highly recommend the 16 course tasting menu.  The nice thing to note about this fine establishment is that not everyone in your party needs to order the same thing.  My wife knew she could not get through 16 courses, so she opted for the 6 course a la carte menu (still $195).  I, on the other hand, selected the 16 course tasting menu.  At $395, this is by far the most expensive meal I have ever paid for, but then again how often do you get the chance to dine at one of the most renowned restaurants in the world.  Every single dish was done to perfection.  I have to say that the staff was very attentive and my wife and I never felt that they were eyeing us like hawks.  They were not intrusive at all (unlike what some reviewers have mentioned).  I am actually glad that our reservations were early because if you choose the 16 course menu, you will be there for a while.  From the amuse bouche, to the elaborate bread cart, to the courses themselves, and the desserts at the end, I have to say there is not a single thing I can complain about.  In fact, because I had mentioned it was my wife's birthday when I made the reservation, they even came out with a cake and candle for her!  We didn't get the entire cake, but they gave us 2 slices (on the house)!When we completed our dining experience, we were escorted back through the hotel to The Mansion where we had entered and into the limo back to our hotel. Bottom line:  most expensive meal I have ever had, but well worth every penny!Take advantage of the limo service. It was a fun (and safe) way of enjoying the experience. We started with a bottle of champagne on the way, and when we arrived at MGM, we were dropped off at the Mansion through a private entrance, escorted all the way to the hostess stand. Greeted immediately and seated in the most elegant dining room right next to the fireplace. The décor and color scheme was beautiful. Loved the Asian inspired uniforms as well. Not knowing if I'd be able to make it through the Sixteen Course Degustation Menu, I opted to try the Six Course Prixe Fixe Menu. L'Amuse-boucheBeet Velouté with Burrata***Une EntréeL'Œuf de Poule mollet et friand, légèreté au fin Comte et  Iberico de Bellota**Une Soupe(We did salad instead)LArtichaut Violet***Deux Plats au choixLe Black Cod, with a yuzu daikon velvet pureeLa Langoustine, Truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage***Fromage ***Dessert Le Rose FleuriI won't get into detail about every single dish, but  I have to say L'Œuf de Poule was by far my favorite. Sampling off the Cheese Trolley, Camembert and Compte were fantastic. The Bread Trolley. THAT BUTTER! Imported from Brittany, can I get a take home gallon of that? Dessert Trolley. Not gonna lie. By the time this came around, things were starting to be a little blurry. I had enjoyed my wine pairing, maybe a little too much. I highly suggest doing to pairing, the wines were fantastic. The take home gift of Pound Cake was a nice treasure to wake up to the next morning with my coffee. I truly enjoyed my meal, from what I remember.My husband wished me a happy 10th Anniversay and rattled off "Oh, by the way, we have a reservation for Joel Robuchon tonight at 9:30." Huh? What? A few hours later we were pulling up to MGM Grand's valet.Upon arriving to the restaurant, the hostess asked that we wait in the lounge while they prepare our table. A gentleman came by and asked if we'd like Champagne while we wait. Why not? Ten years of marriage deserves a toast. Little did we know, those two glasses of champagne were $29 each. Sneaky. Our table was in the garden, flowers and vines were all around. The tables had teal runners, white napkins tied with teal ribbon. This shade was nearly identical to the colors I used for my wedding. Pure coincidence, but it was a lovely nod to our memorable day. The menu was presented and we were given time to peruse it. It's overwhelming. There is the 16 course tasting menu, which is mighty tempting, an a la carte menu and several prix-fixe options. We opted for the prixe-fixe that offered two appetizers, main course and dessert ($198 per person). You choose your dishes from a varied selection. We each chose a cold and hot appetizer, entree and dessert; we felt this was the best way to sample as much of the menu as possible without gorging ourselves or breaking the bank. You're given a choice of flat or sparkling water ($10 per bottle of Evian). We also selected a half bottle Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc ($35) and then our feast was underway. We began with a Split Pea Amuse Bouche, it has marshmallows (savory, not sweet) pistachios and another tasty bite I cannot recall. I've heard tales of the bread cart, but I hadn't imagined this glorious nirvana with more than a dozen options. We had about five rounds of bread. Yes, seriously. It was complete carbicide. We loved every minute. My final meal will include their bread cart. No question. They also hand churn butter; there's a lovely presentation, and the olive oil is divine. Don't miss the croissants! They were so fabulous, I now want to visit France. Next, were the cold appetizers: asparagus with orange vinaigrette and sea urchin, and king crab salad.  Then, the warm appetizers: Crispy soft boiled egg in light comte cheese sauce with Iberico de Bellota ham, our favorite dish. Stellar. And truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage ($35 supplement), it was tasty, but not worth the upcharge. Our entree selections included, suckling pig prepared three ways: braised shoulder, chop and chorizo cannelloni ($30 supplement) and braised beef cheeks in eggplant and the most delicious mashed potatoes in existence. We also tacked on a cheese course from the trolley ($30), there were plenty of soft and hard cheese to choose from. We favor hard cheeses, but did try one soft cheese that was described as warm fondue, rings of Spruce tree are wrapped around the young cheese to impart flavor and vessel for transport. We agreed it was awful, thankfully the hard cheeses and the Roquefort did not disappoint. And finally, dessert! Frank had the chocolate soufflé ($15 supplement), it was outstanding. I had a raspberry mascarpone something or another. It had the most concentrated raspberry flavor imaginable. In addition to dessert, you're given the opportunity to select treats from the Mignardises trolley. I refer to this as the Willy Wonka experience. There must have been a hundred different items to choose from, we only chose a handful because we were beyond stuffed. The tirimisu was delicious and I've never liked creme brulee until now. With the check, we were given a parting gift: a citrus pound cake, and photo book. It was a huge splurge, but a fantastic experience. My expectations were incredibly high for a restaurant of this caliber. It is the first and only 3 Star Michelin Guide Winner in Las Vegas. We have some prime choices, but Joel Robuchon is definitely the upper echelon of dining.Not only is the decor beautiful, but the service and food is jaw dropping.  Champagne is brought to start....ummm yes!!! Girl loves rose! You can create your own courses or prix fixe.First, the bread cart! A large cart filled with an assortment of bread is brought to your table.  You get to make your own bread basket...plan ahead my lady friends, I definitely didn't go rocking a leger that night...Next the courses start. Food is rich, but portions are small...so they kind of balance each other out. They do have dishes that are on the healthy side if that's what you are looking for.Dessert, a large dessert cart is brought table side.  A cake stand is placed on your table and you just pick as many mini desserts as you like.  The detail is beautiful, they look so cute you almost don't want to eat them! Annnndddd then....yes I was a glutton that night, my regular dessert came. Chocolate soufflé, so airy and light(haha not really though).Lastly, another large cart full of fresh herbs is brought table side where you make your own pot of fresh tea.  So many different types of mint. The experience alone is worth the visitI can finally cross this place off my bucket list. It's been on there since I saw it profiled on a Travel Channel show more than a decade ago. It's a formal space that's fit for any special occasion -- like my birthday. Seating is comfortable, especially if you can get one of the corner booths. The decor is ornate in an old world sort of way. I felt like I was dining at my grandmother's place in the sense of its formality (minus the plastic covering that was on her furniture). Dishes are all a work of art. Everything is meticulously placed and plated. Plates and bowls are unique to most dishes and compliment the aesthetic of the food. The bread cart is as amazing as everyone says. I wasn't shy about selecting a few. The bacon bread, brioche with gruyere, and mini croissant were standouts. The separate cart for the butter is nearly as impressive with its tower of rich, creamy butter. Even that is beautifully presented as it's carved and plated table side in an "O" shape and finished with a touch of salt.Between the two of us, my wife and I shared three appetizers. The $26 supplement for the mushroom  and veal ravioli was steep, but we reveled in every amazing bite. The Alaskan king crab salad was beautifully plated and a forkful of crab, avocado, tomato with olive oil with each bite proved to be light, slightly acidic, delicate, and refreshing. The asparagus veloute that followed was velvety smooth.The first entree to arrive was a bowl with roasted lobster, chestnuts, asparagus in a shellfish jus. It was an interesting dish with bold, earthy flavors. A rich and hearty dish perfect for the chilly weather. The grilled rib eye plate that followed was almost like a parody of high-end, fine dining restaurant dishes with it's minuscule portions. The two slices of beef were small, but at least they were excellent cuts of tender, well seasoned beef. The addition of Robuchon's famous butter-laden potato puree lived up to the hype. The final entree -- roasted veal chops with thin mushroom ravioli -- was one of my favorites. The sweetbreads that accompanied it were like tiny, crispy croutons that enhanced the savoriness of the dish while adding a contrast in textures.For dessert we opted for the chocolate soufflé -- a perfect example of restrained sweetness and the perfect balance of bitterness. Raised high above the ramekin, it was an impressive sight that eventually collapsed after the addition of ice cream. There was no need to reinvent this classic dish as their execution was as good as any I've experienced.When dining here you always have to save room for the mignardises cart. My wife declined their offer of a birthday cake when making our reservation (that's a $30 supplement, I believe) so they brought out a pre-selected plate of mignardises. Which I was perfectly happy with. The choices on the cart are plentiful and I would have be too indecisive to select. I made short work of that plate and they brought the cart around to offer more. The lady bug -- a chocolate mousse tart -- was the best of the bunch. Our server also recommended the tiramisu and creme brûlée. Both were quickly brought out from the kitchen. Served in shot glass-sized glasses, the tiramisu was a beautifully layered, creamy rendition and the creme brûlée was equally amazing.While it is an expensive restaurant, if you have the funds it's worth experiencing at least once.A once in a lifetime meal experience...Eric R. asked me to pick one restaurant I had always wanted to try since I moved to Vegas 8 years ago.  Joel Robuchon was at the top of my long-term bookmark list, and he told me to make a reservation.We missed out on the golden limo by one month as that service was discontinued - bummer!  We were seated in a corner booth, with a deep purple hue.  The restaurant is very intimate and from our corner we could see everything, including the private room through the window with a living wall.We had several servers, one for drinks and desserts, one for taking our order, and one for breads and savory dishes.  We learned that most of the staff has worked there for over a decade together as a team.  I had a glass of Veuve Cliquot Brut and Eric R. had off-dry Riesling Kabinett.Eric R and I opted for the menu that included a choice of appetizer and entree, and also included the amuse bouche, bread cart, and mignardises cart.  We tried several breads accompanied with the whipped butter and sea salt and Spanish olive oil.  I tried the saffron brioche, olive baguette, and gruyere roll to start.  The amuse bouche was a strawberry gazpacho with sheep's milk cheese, balsamic and pistachio.  It was very refreshing.For appetizers, Eric R got the caviar atop salmon tartare with saffron and coriander crisps (for a supplement).  I began with the sea urchin and langoustine medallions in seaweed gelee and pureed cauliflower.  For entree, Eric R. ordered the roasted lobster with morels and asparagus in shellfish jus, and I got the caramelized black cod in Malabar pepper sauce with bok choy and freeze-dried lobster roe.  The entrees were accompanied by Robuchon's supposedly famous whipped potatoes.  Now I like potatoes but Eric R. doesn't.  We both tried them and both agreed they tasted like paste, that you may tile a floor with perhaps?  It was really a weird consistency and flavor, so that was yucky...at least that just came with the meal and wasn't our choice.For dessert, we went wild on the mignardises cart.  I had yuzu truffle, pecan dark chocolate, coconut eclair, hazelnut macaron, and lemon meringue.  Eric R. got blackberry opera cake pecan dark chocolate, strawberry pistachio tart, strawberry margarita gelee, blueberry white chocolate cake, and a made-to-order mini creme brulee.We finished the meal with a pot of gyokuro green tea.  It was a wonderful experience in a beautiful ambiance.  At the end of our experience, I was given a lemon pound cake as a parting gift.  I think it is a great place for a special occasion.Joel Robuchon perfectly embodies the essence of the ultra-ostentatious city of Las Vegas in all its sinfully delicious glory. The extravagant décor will leave you breathless--as will the bill at the end of the meal.. but let's worry about that later, shall we? We were guided by the hostess into a gorgeous "garden" with a moss wall and beautifully fragrant, vibrant flowers. From our seats, we could see the enormous chandelier in the central dining room. I highly recommend requesting this table because it was absolutely stunning! Pretty sure even the Italian Mafia seated next to us were impressed by the scenery. We debated between 5-course Menu A ($250) or 16-course degustation ($445), but ultimately decided on Menu A with multiple supplements. Throughout the evening, the birthday boy and I played a game to compare whose dish was better. My choices slightly edged out his, but there's no surprise there. *insert princess emoji*.  For the sake of brevity, I'll just recommend the winning dishes:Cold Appetizers: L'Oursin- Sea Urchin with langoustineHot Appetizers:La Langoustine- Truffled Langoustine Ravioli with foie gras sauce (AMAZING! Suppl. $35)Main Courses:Le Spaghetti- Spaghetti with a soft boiled egg, uni, caviar (best dish, hands down; Suppl. $60)La Langouste- Lobster with lemongrass emulsionDesserts:La Sphere- Lemon shaped-sugar sphere filled with lemon sorbetLa Chocolate- Black forest cake (CUTEST. DESSERT. EVER. Picturesque)The bread cart is spectacular, but that dessert cart is simply DIVINE. Desserts so adorable that even the most apathetic sociopaths would squeal with joy. Although the total bill came out to a whopping $825 with tax and tip, I'd say the entire experience was worth the hefty price tag.  It's unlikely I'd return because it was almost too rich to enjoy repeatedly, but for someone truly special (such as yourself, duh) there's no better way to celebrate. Nothing says "I love you" quite like foie gras, black truffle, and caviar. Except for.. ah, nevermind. Best girlfriend award or what?For our 10th wedding anniversary we decided to go all out and dine at Joel Robuchon at the MGM Grand. Thanks to the yelp reviews, we knew to book their complimentary gold limo in advance and got one of the three pickup services of the evening. We were taken to the private gated entrance to the MGM mansion with $5000 a night villas (who knew?). Then led through the mansion and high stakes poker tables to the restaurant in the casino.The meal: You do not have to order the degustation 16 course meal. Trust me on this. Not only do they offer an extensive bread cart with as much as you desire with honestly the best butter we have ever had (see pic) you do not have to order dessert as there is an included sweets cart with whatever you want. I ordered the lobster ravioli for the appetizer and pork for my entree. Both hands down the best on the menu. The pork was so tender like cutting into a rib eye- the ravioli has been a staple on the menu since day one and you'll see why. My husband  ordered the chilled lobster, seared foie gras and sea bass along with the cheese cart for dessert since he's not a chocolate fan. One of the best meals of our lives and we've been to French Laundry in Yountville twice. The service: this is where we only gave four out of five stars. The waiters were fantastic but again having seen the synchrony and service at French Laundry it's hard to compare. Special note: the chef came out to chat a bit during dessert so that was a nice personal touch. Would definitely return again.
China Max=I had a coupon for another place that apparently closed, so we wound up here.  Oops.  We thought other names for the place might be:  China Minimum.  China Don't.  China Ridden Hard And Put Away Wet.The service was nice enough but nothing else was.  The lipstick on the spoon that came with my daughter's egg drop soup pretty much set the tone.  The veggie chow fun and the veggie fried rice were sub-unremarkable.  The baby corn was overly large (we called it toddler corn) and had a musty flavor.  Ug.  The chow fun tasted mostly of soy sauce.  The veggie fried rice was OK.  Oh, we started with crab puffs.  They were overly oily and had no crab flavor.Just call it China Don't and leave it at that.
Restaurant Dans La Bouche=My God que les serveuses (et les clientes !) sont belles dans ce resto ! Je sais qu'on va manger dans un restaurant d'abord et avant tout pour la qualité de la bouffe et l'ambiance, mais dans ce cas-ci, ce n'est pas compliqué, on se croirait dans un lounge select géré par une agence de mannequins. Je suis allé manger là avec un ami en visite et je crois qu'il tombait amoureux d'une nouvelle fille à toutes les 30 secondes.Mais venons-en à la bouffe, puisque cela a une grande importance, après tout. De ce côté-là, aucune déception, c'était excellent, la viande juste à point, les légumes l'accompagnant offraient une bonne balance. Les prix sont plus élevés que la moyenne des restos sur cette rue, par contre les femmes mangent gratuitement certains soirs de la semaine (mardi et jeudi, je crois). Pas sûr que j'ai bien compris cette promotion, par contre. Comme disait mon ami, si c'est vraiment complètement gratuit pour les femmes, où sont les pauvres ? Tous les clients semblent être plutôt aisés, alors que tout le monde sait que la gratuité attire normalement une clientèle moins riche (ce qui est tout à fait normal). Bref, à ce sujet, je me dois de pousser la recherche un peu plus.
Two Hippies Magic Mushroom Burgers=So I'm usually not one for the whole pothead marketing scheme, which we've all seen many a Cheba Hut try to pull off, but Two Hippies is doing it right.  The biggest difference is that their food is actually worth eating when you don't have the munchies.  The place is tiny but they've given you a place or two to sit down.  It is filled with all of the psychedelics that you would expect and that you can think of.  But remember this place is all about the goods.  The Magic Mushroom Burger is a MUST if you like shrooms at all...the combination with the steak burger, cheese and "Liquid Sunshine Sauce" puts a taste in your mouth that is honestly a little surreal. I was lucky enough to score my burger, fries and coke for a 5 spot flat.  They also have some very special brownies that are a tasty treat after you've put down the goods.  But they are quick to let you know..."Don't Tell ANYONE Where You Bought Them."   They've just extended their hours to 9pm so stop by for lunch or dinner and I promise you'll get rocked.I was slightly disappointed with my Magic Mushroom Burger when I just finally tried Two Hippies' flagship burger after reading about the sober, blown minds of other Yelpers. But as I got more into the "special" sauce (probably shouldn't ask any questions about it), reveled in the quality ingredients, and remembered that I just paid 5 dollars event for a large burger, giant sack of fries, and can of sod-e pop I started falling in love with the place.It and the whole strip of stores there have a definite time warp effect if you are there around lunch time. The kooky yet wholesome collection of stores, mix of intentional and unintentional nostalgic decor, genuinely friendly store owners, and time-is-not-of-the-essence attitude of the patrons throw me back to my feel-good childhood going to pizza parlors and mom and pop stores in Moon Valley. It has a near perfect blend of Americana in the stores there: Burger Shack, Barber Shop, Pizza Parlor, Head Shop, Motorcycle Repair, and the soon-to-be New Orleans Coffee and Balloons(???). (Well maybe I'll have to hold off judgment until that last establishment finally opens, but you can bet I'll be there on opening day to figure out what the hell coffee, balloons, and New Orleans have to do with each other in the same shop.)Two Hippies seems to be run by an actual Mom and Pop who are actually interested in learning the name and story of everyone who walks in and making sure they had a good meal. Meals then come in sack form and are difficultly eaten on dense collections of bar stools inside or outside next to a bar that is too high even for a tall guy like me to eat from. But the whole action of kicking it on a patio bar stool while eating a burger mid-air out of a wrapper just adds to the feel and will eventually evoke a Jules Winnfield impersonation, quoting, "Uummmm, that's a tasty burger!"I feel like now have our "Big Kahuna" burger establishment in central Phoenix. It's not as refined and awesome as Delux or Fez, or as high quality as Welcome Diner, but its an overdue innovation for a quick, cheap sack lunch.But keep in mind the area still can be pretty seedy even at lunch time. There is quite a few homeless people roaming around at all times, usually including the war veteran guy in a wheelchair with only a few teeth left that likes to wear wife beaters and direct traffic. I also got to hear a long and drawn out "bitch needs to gimme ma money" conversation when I was eating on the patio.My only other complaint is that part of their decorations is a vintage cabinet Ms. Pac-Man machine that is supposedly in working order that they are just using as a table to hold flavored candy sticks and other crap. It's a travesty. They need to fire that baby up.I hate soggy fries. The rest of my household gobbled them up, but unless I get a good crunch as I bite into the potato goodness, I'll pass.That being said, the burgers at Two Hippies are good enough to keep a recovering vegetarian such as myself coming back.We went on a Saturday afternoon and the place had a steady coming-and-going of families, couples, dirty hippies and assorted other motley folk coming through the door. The place is tiny so most of us waited outside and watched the homeless pass by as we waited for our food. Grabbed our brown bag and everyone else in my party munched on fries the whole way home.. I sipped on my cream soda in an attempt to get the mushy-undercooked potato taste out of my mouth.I ordered the daily special, a green chile burger. Man-o-man... The burger was topped in a whole, perfectly-roasted green chile which added a nice bite to the special sauce. The bun was perfectly toasted and the fixin's perfectly piled (there's nothing worse than taking the first bite of a burger and having the toppings squeeze out the other end).. The beef was fantastic quality and the patty was a good size, but not one of those we'll-give-you-a-huge-burger-so-your-gut-hurts-afterward burgers.The signature magic mushroom burger looked great, as well. We had tried to go earlier in the week around dinnertime, but the sign on the front and back door says they close at 4 p.m. and they were definitely closed the evening we tried to go. I believe they're also closed on Sunday, so don't try to sneak in here instead of going to church.Hippies scare me.     So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy, which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.It was all for nothing. No hippies around, just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6" could easily eat off of them.  Anyways for $5 flat, you get a kick ass burger, a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries, and a can of soda.   It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say "it's organic, don't panic".  Jerry's dead, but this place lives on.  Thanks hippies!Barack Obama ate here!  That's right BITCH, the next Pressy had a burger here.  This from the owners mouth.At any rate, man did I want to LOVE this place, unfortunately my burger was over cooked.  The seasoning was great so I think it was just my bad luck.  I will go back.  But here's the real reason to eat here, it's Fucking CHEAP!  $5 get's you a burger, fries and a coke!  You can't beat that!So, i've worked at two yummy burger places (Delux and Fez), so I think I know a good burger when I'm presented with one.  Two Hippies is yummy, nothing fancy, nothing incredible, but what do you expect for $5? I got yummy seasoned fries (which were soggy, but the irony is I LOVE soggy french fries!), and the burger had yummy carmelized onions, which is Delux's secret!The best surprise was the owner, his customer service was incredibly great! Best I've had in a long time. SUPER nice guy, and even gave my fiance a free soda! Gotta luv that Dark Cherry pop!Go, it's cute and fun!!Mmmm Magic Mushrooms... *drool*I've been to this place twice.  Once with a buddy and once with the wife.  I usually test a place with my buddy before I deem it wife-worthy, and believe me... it is WIFE-WORTHY!  Everything is fresh according to Mrs. Hippy.  I found that statement a bit odd after seeing an empty box of frozen burger patties. Not that I care!  Those things are bad ass!  They also make their own thousand-island dressing for the mushroom burger and its phenomenal!Trip #1: I ordered the Jalapeno Burger, Fries, and a can of soda. Total price was $5 even. The burger was surprisingly unmatched, for the price.  I mean it is no Island's burger, but it is very tasty and inexpensive. The fries are those crinkle cut ones like you used to get in elementary school for lunch.  Fat, juicy, and crispy. The soda was... well... a can of soda.Trip #2: I ordered the Magic Mushroom Burger, Fries, and a can of soda. Total price, again, was $5 even. I'm beginning to like this! The burger had tons of Swiss cheese and mushrooms on it.  A dabble of thousand island (which was rich and creamy) completed this masterpiece. The fries, same. The soda, same.I preferred the jalapeno burger, just because that's how I roll.  I like jalapeno burgers.  If you are a Swiss n' mushroom burger person, I'm sure you will find that this burger is unbeatable.Two Hippies is a great little no brainer kind of placed to eat. Incredibly small and ran incredibly well, be prepared to squeeze your way in and out .   They have great specials and the price is definitely right. For 5.00 you have lunch and maybe a bit of an experience as well.   Today with kids in tow , the hubby and I had Guacamole Burger, Fries, Onion Rings and A super yummo  Mushroom Burger.  The mushroom burger was so good , love the mushrooms, cheese and the bun really worked. I am so glad they put some thought into the bread. The Guacamole was not what I envisioned  with thick guac, it had runny stuff that frightened me.  The kiddettes had sliders , so cute with their tiny little buns, the burgers not the kids.  We all adored the fries they just really work with the burgers, the seasoning is "lawrey seasonish " but what the hey it was good stuff.   Pretty fast service for  a line out the door on a Saturday afternoon , it was already past one and people were hungry , big orders in and out and lots of people !  They have service down you walk up order they write it on a lunch bag and wham it comes out in about 10 -15 minutes. They don't mess with  a soda fountain  so you have to be okay with drinks out of the can. It kind of gives it a "Whacka-whacka"  old school feel! For those of you young yelpers , yes we didn't have an endless soda fountain back when I was a kid. The parking really sucks , it is tough to get in and tough to get out I literally thought we were going to be in one of those chinese puzzles where you have to move the pieces  every which way to work .  People are very serious about getting in there !This area is teaming with unique options and real honest to goodness bargains. Stop by Magic Mushroom and get a burger, fries and a can of soda for $5 even. The owners start early in the morning to grind the meat fresh ever day that goes into the burgers, now that's some serious attention to detail. If available, and you're really hungry, try the Fat Ass ($7.50). This burger is just as much fun ordering, as it is eating. A couple of beef patties with all the fixings, plus bacon on a deliciously soft bun, sides of fries, onion rings and 2 sodas, whew! Go Fat Ass! Inside Two Hippies there's enough tie-dyed, flower child kitsch packed into this place to transport you to the summer of love in one step through the door. Look out Brady's, there's a new bunch in town!Five bucks.  A burger, fries and can of pop.  How can you go wrong?I had the Guac burger.  It's the reason I took a star away.  The burger itself was great, but the guac?  Notsomuch.  They do have a good array of different toppings to choose from.  The fries were shoestring-cut and had a spiced salt sprinkled on them.  It was a good-sized serving.  I love a can of pop!  They have Shasta, which is two thumbs up for me.  It doesn't have NutraSweet in the diet, but Splenda.  Hooray!Getting out of this place is a bitch so here's my secret: Go out the back way, through the car wash to get to 7th Street.  Traffic on Indian School, right at the 7th Street light, sucks moose balls.Holy cow! This is NOT a "where's the beef?" burger! And, they are hand-formed, saw the guy molding patties with my own eyes!!The greasy, heart-attack-in-a-bag $5 special is not for the faint hearted.The green chile delivered the heat. Couldn't even finish my fries!I WILL be back, but I'm definitely going to have to ration myself! Good thing it's not on my way home from work!!My family has a motto: "Pot just makes me tired and hungry; and I'm already tired and hungry." For some of the family this means "Say no to drugs"; for others it means harder stuff is where it's at; for me it means "I need a burger and a nap."Cue the hippies. Two Hippies served me up a real burger. Like a REAL one! you know curvy like I like em; not flat. The fries came in a paper bag so that no one can claim they had no idea it was bad for them and sue. The bad is clear by the time you take a seat...grease may be my favourite foodI am not going to be the only one not to mention that you get a burger, fries and can of soda (pop for Thomas S and the people of his homeland and surrounding areas--ps they say pop because they would just say soda funny.) for $5!! Way better than fast food for cheaper. I will now end this review because I am tired...and hungry...I've had burgers that cost twice as much with half the taste.  That's what my dad said about his Mushroom Burger.  This must be one of the best values in town and it actually tastes good.  Well, my hamburger has been a little overdone more than once.  But I think that charred flavor just makes it seem like I'm at a family cookout.  The seasoning on the fries is great and I had to stop myself from shoveling them in my mouth.  If you want to eat there, find the picnic tables at the back.  Sure, it's like eating in a parking lot, but you are guaranteed to have hot fries.  CASH ONLY.  They do have an ATM inside.The story of two hippies and finally, a great idea.In a land filled with broken dreams and grumbling tummies, two hippies met while attending a Phish concert. Recognizing each other as hippies by their standard issue, Grateful Dead t-shirts, big daddy; as he preferred to be called, introduced himself to Little "T". In this moment, the clouds parted while angels played their harpsichords and trumpets from a Farmhouse. "Hey, you like burgers?" Little "T" asked big daddy. "Hhhehheehee, of course. You ever seen the northern lights?" asked big daddy.... fast forward seven years ...  Little "T" finally had a great idea. "Hey big daddy, wouldn't it be cool if there was a burger shop where all the hungry people could come and eat a burger, fries, and a drink for just a dollar?" "No way man, burgers are like heaven and people would pay like, $10 for an awesome burger, fries, and a drink." he replied.After years of debating and three failed marriages between the both of them, "T" and daddy settled on $5 as a great price for burger, fries and a drink. Today, you can find this $5 meal in Central Phoenix 365 days a year, except Sundays, holidays, between the hours of 8pm and 11am, or from 4:20 to 4:21 -- hippies gotta sleep; and, you know... ;-)Stop in for lunch one day (or dinner), order up their daily special, their house bacon cheese burger, or even a hot dog. While considering your options, browse the toppings list such as, fresh jalapenos, roasted hatch chili, caramelized onions, onion rings, house made habanero ketchup, and more. Side note to all you spicy food extraordinaires, the habanero ketchup is down-right fantastic. In fact, I think this ketchup steals the show. While greasy burger spots aren't on the normal "bucket list", if you love spicy food and in some weird way make a list of all the places you wish you could try before you die, you NEED to add this to the list. I almost wish I could buy a batch of this stuff to take home - OMG that was spicy!Oh, the burger and steak cut fries aint bad either ;-) I ordered the bacon cheese burger, sans the tomato, add jalapenos and a side of that delish house made habanero ketchup. It was a burger like none other I've had!Happy Yelping Phoenix!
Chompie's Deli=I finally made it to this Chompie's location... and just like the rest of the Chompie's I've been to, it goes to the category "Best Deli in AZ" - still not New York, and I think I may even prefer Goldberg's in Atlanta, but in Phoenix, Chompie's is the place!We were there for dinner and I did order one thing that I never ordered from Chompie's before... Sweet Potato Fries!  Yes, Chompie's has pretty good sweet potato fries - yay!  I filled up on pickles and I also had a salad and a scoop of their whitefish salad.  (I probably would not order that again).  Stick with knishes, bagels, sandwiches, and even omelettes - you'll be pleased.  Oh - and I cannot forget their soups... especially matzah ball and kreplach - yummy!  And if you have a sweet tooth, there is PLENTY to choose from!Now I'm craving Chompie's again... I have to figure out which location is closest to my new digs!Oy ve iz mir!Not to be a kvetch....but I consider myself to be an expert on Jewish delis.  As a New Yorker from a predominantly Jewish area and married to a Jew, I've had more than my fair share of experiences at them.  My husband and I woke up this morning with a burning desire for a good bagel, corned beef on rye, and a knish.  So I schlepped all the way up to the PV Mall to get it.Ok, first of all, the decor is terribly schlocky.  Its kind of like the tourist trap Jewish deli you find in Times Square.  Its like a Disney version of a NY deli.  I take my number and head over to the cold case to get some drinks....of course they didn't have regular lemon Snapple (and why should they?  Its not like every deli, pizza place, and convenience store in NY carries it....) but they did have Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray which is always a welcome sight.  Another thing they had in the cold case which I found to be odd were jars of Nathan's pickles.  Nathan's, like the hot dog place.  I would imagine a Jewish deli would have Ba Tampte pickles....I didn't even know Nathan's made pickles!  It was a little lame to be honest.Anyways, I go up to the counter where there doesn't seem to be anyone working.  There was no organization to it.  So I waited.  And waited.  In New York, the deli is a finely tuned machine designed to move people quickly.  Chompie's? Eh, not so much.  When I finally did place my order, the guy who took it had a hard time punching it into the computer and asked me to repeat it several times.  Despite saying I wanted my bagel toasted several times I was given a cold, untoasted bagel.  I waited a little longer for my order to come up and went on my merry way.  Here is the breakdown of the food we ordered-Matzoh ball soup- Surprisingly good.  I have never had matzoh ball soup with carrots and celery...so much chazerei!  Just give me the matzoh ball! Although, I will admit, it was solid.  I wouldn't go all the way to Chompie's for it because I know that I can make it better in my own kitchen. Plain bagel "toasted" with cream cheese- Terrible.  The bottom of the bagel was entirely too thick and was very hard.  They didn't even cut it all the way through, probably because the crust is too thick! Corned beef on rye- Meh.  The corned beef wasn't very good, it wasn't corned enough.  If they make their own they didn't use a piece of brisket that was fatty enough.  The rye (which was not marble rye...) was lackluster.   It couldn't handle the corned beef, became soggy, and eventually fell apart.  The pickle it came with was the grossest thing I've ever seen.  And it was definitely a kosher dill, even though I asked for a half sour.  The potato salad was actually really good though.Knish- Terrible.  The knishes in my elementary school cafeteria were better than this.  First of all, the outer crust was way too flimsy.  It should have been much, much, thicker, especially considering the gargantuan size of the knish.  We essentially ate a large plate of mashed potatoes.  The potato inside itself was unremarkable.  Not only do I have this Jewish thing going on but I'm also Irish....I've never met a potato dish I didn't like.  Until today.  I didn't even finish my half of the knish. Now for the prices.  What's with this meshugas?  $2.29 for a bagel with cream cheese is a tad much.  In NY they run you about $1.35.  The corned beef sandwich was $12.50!  Now, I've paid that much for sandwiches in NY before but you get 2 lbs of meat and several layers of sandwich!  This was not a $12.50 sandwich.  I was also going to get us some whitefish salad to sample but at $15.99/lbs it wasn't happening.  Why anyone should schlep all this way, in this heat, schvitzing all over, for this dreck?  I don't know!Every time I go to Phoenix, I stop into Chompies at least once.They have a cool breakfast/lunchy deli theme. It would be like dressing up a hole in the wall ny deli.I usually get breakfast even at lunch time.The staff is normally friendly and inviting.The food options are plentiful. Anything you want from a NY Deli is here. They bake their own breads and make most everything in house. Chompies serves BIG oversized portions and I usually dont finish mine but will also try other peoples dishes when I'm there. order frsh squeezed OJ its the real deal.I was watching Man VS Food and he did a challange there and he couldnt do it. Its a dozen chopped sauteed beef brisket, latke potato cake topped with onions and cheese on a homemade bun thing(I forgot what they call it). sliders and they looked so good I'm gonna get those next time I'm there.Make sure to try any of the desserts. They display them nicely and eat it or take it home.mmmmmAnyways theres a couple of Chompies in Metro Phoenix/Scottsdale area and go to either one and you'll get some good grub!I was a little hesitant to come to Chompie's in a Sunday afternoon. Not sure what to expect. Anyways, wow. The place is jammed pack. Everyone is here. So I had their breakfast here before and wasn't that impressed. Today, I ordered their full hot pastrami sandwich on a Kaiser roll with a side of coleslaw. Goodness. So good. I love hot pastrami sandwiches when done right and they did it right. Nice a juicy with lots of flavor in every bite. Loved the Kaiser roll too. Very fresh and the roll just made the sandwich really good. The coleslaw was really good. Had a little bit of sweetness to it. I really enjoyed this meal. My wife was craving a salad. Really at a deli. Anyways, she ordered a Grilled Chicken Cesar's salad. It was a really big portion and she just gobbled up that salad. She really liked it. Didn't get to try it but looked really good. Our service was right on. We sat at our table and right away they brought us a small plate of dill pickles. Love dill and they were really good. Anyways, our server welcomed us right away a told us he would be right there in a minute. On the spot he was there takin our order. Water glasses were at our table fairly quickly and they had people filling up our glasses. Our food came out really quickly and our server was always checking on us even through it was really busy. I would have to say that we really enjoyed our meal here. Quick and efficient service with some really good food. We saw that dessert menu and was really temped, but maybe next time. Enjoy we sure did.
Amélie's French Bakery=My first visit to Amelie's and I am a lifelong, hymn-singing devotee.  I knew I can expect quality goodies from the many reviews I read, but to try them in real time was another experience.  I went in after a late lunch with my sister (we saved our dessert space specifically for Amelies)  Stepping in, the insides were soooooo cute, just makes you want to stay in for a couple hours :)  All the desserts looked simply indulgent, and it was hard to select just 2-3 items.  I love tea cakes, but when I couldnt decide between the raspberry and lemon, the lovely lady said she would choose raspberry--as did I.  And Im glad I did because it was so light yet rich and flavorful.  Light because I didnt feel the need for milk with it :-D  I also got a Palmier (very crispy and buttery) and a cinnamon stick.  I chose smaller and lighter things because I had a big lunch.  I will be back to sample everything else, and more time on my hands.The service was excellent, even with a line behind me, the person behind the counter patiently waited while I selected.  Everyone was nice, helpful and fast.I just realized that I have not reviewed Amelie's - one of my favorite-est bakeries around.Let me just tell you about my love affair with this French bakery. 1) They have salted caramel brownies. Yup, you read it correctly. Absolutely delectable salty/sweet/chocolately goodness. It will certainly give you a toothache and you'll appreciate it.2) This place is open 24 hours. Holla! 3) The croissants. Oh momma likes. My personal fave is the strawberry cream cheese, but the chocolate will do in a pinch, too.4) Great coffee. The kind of coffee that you enjoy outside the states,. No Folgers, here, friends.5) Free WiFi! Woot!6) The all around lovely atmosphere. Amelie's is just a cozy, breath of fresh air for me. The perfect spot to park with a laptop or stuff my face with umpteen pastries.On a side note, I haven't tried Amelie's lunchy food yet, but I'm looking forward to it. Amelie's makes me (almost) love the French - it's THAT good.Hard to review Amelie's. It's so awesome, unique, good for CLT, comfy, all around kick ass, that I gotta go after the nits. Which are:Table immediately inside the door so that would-be lunchers break left and right, confused, and have to spend a sec asking "are you in line?" More than occasional space cadet order takersPrice inflexibility (adding things to, say, a lunch tartine can run you upwards of 2 bucks, if they let you do it at all)But, I never leave here having spent less than $10, and my theory is that there's some sort of weird hypnosis that gorgeous case of pastries triggers. All the color and perfect chocolate swirls, perhaps... anyways, when I come to, I've got not only my coffee and sammich but also a baguette, cup of soup and tart tucked under my arm (well, in a box, anyway).Take it from an NYC pastry hunter - prices on tarts, cream puffs, macaroons, etc. are reasonable, darlings. A perfect eclair is an extensive and laborious process.The vegan soup is deeelish, as are their other choices (seems there's always a veg or vegan option, so yay!).And 24hrs? Quelle bonne idée!We stopped by here on the way home to satisfy my special lady wife's need for sweets after two stops indulging my own beer needs. i was surprised at the crowd just before 9 o'clock on a Thursday night. i really had not read anything about this place and had driven by countless times having no clue it even existed. The cluster of ooglers and droolers deciding what to order wasn't ideal, but some dude took our order and moved us along.  i just told him i wanted something chocolate and chocolate with some chocolate. Whatever he picked out was perfect. The chocolate mousse-stuff went nicely with my Abita Jockamo IPA and the latest episode of Big Brother. All in all, our order was like $13 for 2 little bites and two bigger treats. Thanks be to the Entertainment Book for $5 off, bringing the total to $8.6/8/12All that we tried from here were simply terrific!  If our next visit is just as great as our first, I'm sure I wouldn't have a problem bumping my rating up to five stars.  :)  So, why not give five stars outright?  I'd have to say it was due to my slight disappointment in the atmosphere...We came in and were immediately greeted by the cashier at the counter, which was situated right in front of the entrance and to the right of the pastry display cases.  The coffee preparation area is behind and to the right of the cashier.  All of this served to show just how busy the staff members were: the pastry chefs working in the back, who would come out to deliver fresh-baked goodies and refill the cases, the cashier taking orders at the counter, a couple of people manning the coffee area (preparing espressos, lattes, mochas, and French presses, just to name a few), and a few more going in and out of the kitchen preparing sandwiches and other items.  This gave the place a bistro feel.  I suppose I was expecting a little more laid-back and romantic cafe, with an in-house bakery in the back- I quickly got over it.  Amelie's is a patisserie with a cafe attached to it.  We sat ourselves at the set of love seat, chairs, and coffee table across from the cashier and the bakery's entrance, so for the most part of our meal, my views of the pastry cases and the rest of the cafe were blocked by lines of people ordering and paying at the cashier-- not conducive to a relaxing breakfast/brunch.  I kept wishing there was a wood panel screen between our table and the traffic of people to give us some privacy.  Since Mom and sis had no idea of what to order, I decided to start us out with some coffee and chocolate croissants.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA#HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA  Everyone wanted coffee, including me, but I also wanted to try AFB's mocha, so I ordered a large French press (serves 3 or 4) and a mocha latte.  I expected traditional style croissants, so AFB's slightly disappointed me presentation-wise, but as long as the pastries taste delicious, I don't mind, and these croissants were terrific, and they also kept well for the next two days through our vacay in FL.  Among the boxed pastries we took to go http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw#9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw, I really loved the eclairs, which also kept well.  I thoroughly enjoyed the bite through the outer bread layers to find the chocolate filling; It was amazingly creamy and light, yet not fluffy (I don't do fluffy), and the eclairs stayed fresh through numerous times of refrigeration and thaws.  My sis enjoyed her bites of one salted caramel brownie, but interestingly enough, didn't eat the rest of it, nor touch the second one.  They seemed very rich...  I also enjoyed the Napoleon's crunch and buttercream-textured custard filling, but for fear of clogged arteries, I think I'll stay away from now on.  :)As for the savory selections, sister and Mom absolutely LOVED the chicken salad sandwich!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw#TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw  Mom and  I really enjoyed the ham and gruyere tartine-- I loved the crunch of the toasted baguette and thought the saltiness of the cheese and ham paired well with the sweet-goodness of my mocha and croissant.Yes, we've all decided to make AFB our first stop from the airport on our trips back to the Queen City!p.s.  Amelie's is open 24/7!Amelie's. It's an absolute Charlotte staple, honorable mention to the salted caramel brownie, but some of the most apathetic service in town, in my opinion. I'm not too amped on going to Amelie's.....really at all. If you've never been, check it out. If you're visiting from out of town, it's a must. If you're into kitschy decor, by golly, what are you waiting for? If you're into good pastries, look elsewhere. When I first moved to Charlotte, we were all about this joint. Board games, open 24/7, ample seating (inside and in the atrium of the 28th Row), and plenty of caffeine for late-night work sessions. So why 2 stars? Apathy. The service is just abysmal and the product(s) tend to suffer the consequences as result. The trendy little kids behind the counter "go out of their way" to serve you and, dare I say, ask "who's next" in line. There are plenty of things right with Amelie's. Get some staff that actually KNOW the products, give them a little more love, and then put them in front of people. Every time I've visited, which has been sparse in the past few years, I've been in line with newbies. They should be swept off their feet as soon as they make eye contact with the staff. But, instead, I've seen them met with obligatory welcomes and blank stares. Upon our last visit, we went with some go-tos -- Vanilla eclair and the chocolate croissant. Both were kinda blah. Dry, had been sitting in the case for what tasted like a good two or three days, and aren't what they used to be. You know....as long as the salted caramel brownie stays the same, I'm a happy camper. I still love you, Amelie's. You'll always have a place in my Charlotte-loving heart, but your service is just less than desirable.I came here for a coworkers baby shower and could not have been more impressed with the space, the food, and the employees. If you've never been beyond the pastry case in the front of this location you are missing out. It extends so far back it's hard to believe. They have so many little nick-knacks to look at you'll never be bored.I also didn't realize you could rent the place out. Someone told me that it could hold a wedding party of 80! We only had the back rooms rented out for about 20 people and it was plenty of space. Amelie's provided quiche Lorraine which was wonderful, as well as a spinach quiche, their famous pastries, coffee, and orange juice. I was so impressed with their food I took some home to my husband, who took literally a bite out of everything because he couldn't decide what to eat.Back in June (or whenever the hell my second week of vacation was for the year), I went to go see my big sis in Charlotte.  When I was there, she kept telling me about this bakery I just had to try.  Nestled in the NoDa district (hipster central), we went to Amelie's, a 24 hour French bakery/hangout.Now, my sister is fluent in French, and I used to live (and cook!) there.  When it comes to all things French, I can be pretty critical of it (kind of like the same way I am with steaks).  So, we decided to go.  She had been before, and she enjoyed it- but told me there are times when the line can be out the door.  When you pull up, it looks like it is in a strip mall of warehouses (new or old, I have no idea).  When you walk in, you are what seems to be you immersed in pop culture.  I would like to think of it as if Andy Warhol designed the place.  There is a counter with all of the pastries and desserts, and a chalked menu of everything else.  I noticed the seating is interesting, as there are no two tables alike- and it seems there are as many couches as there are seats.  My first visit, I ordered the croque monsieur and a cream soda.  Sis got some kid sized stuff- I asked her if that was all she was getting?   We sat at one of the tables near the door.  As we were waiting, I kept getting the signature dirty looks.  If anyone wanted to start some shit, I was ready!The food then came out.  It was pretty decent, with the flavors of cheese and Dijon adding to it.  I scarfed it, and was wanting more.  But it being a French bakery and all (and the dirty looks I was getting), I decided to just have that.When I came back in town for Thanksgiving, I brought my best friend with me.  We decided to go back.  This time, it was him, my sister, my year old nephew, and myself.  This time, I was starving, and I was not going to hold back.  I ordered a croque monsieur again, and a ham sandwich with cheese.  My buddy got some  kind of sandwich, but I don't remember.   I remember at the time, we didn't get a number (for whatever reason), and then I realized everyone else did.  We had 3 sandwiches coming, they better not lose the order!We sat at a table in the back, with a couch and 2 chairs.  I was playing with my nephew as his face was covered in chocolate (sis got eclairs).  My sis took him outside for a few to get some air.  We were waiting a few, and then I thought I saw our food come out, and the runner you could tell was baffled, as there was no number.  She then ran another order of food, and then I got her attention- "I think those were our sandwiches".  The funny thing is, we never got a receipt either, so it was a matter of faith.  Our food then came out.This time, the croque was very flaky, and not like in a buttery flaky way, but like "god damn, I need water after every bite" flaky.  I washed it down with the other sandwich.  Thankfully the cream soda is sold in pints!It's cool that this place is open at all hours of the day and is pretty large, but I don't know- I can come here every so once in a while, but that gaffe was kind of a turn off.  All the cashier had to say it was for the big motherfucker in camo and a braves hat.  I can ASSURE I was the only one...Another thing that irked me was seeing the crème brulee was already bruleed.  The topping gets compromised after sitting there for 3 hours or more, and let's be honest, they aren't making crème brulees every 3 hours...  And if they are, I sincerely apologize.  But like a great cannoli, you fill the shell when you order it.But hey, what the hell would I know about French cuisine...The quality has fallin to the way side.   No more real butter cream, BUT  Grease Cream they buy in 5 gallon buckets ! !      Frozen   desserts defrosted,  STALE Brownies    this place has seen its hay day its over with Amelies,
Stacy's Smokehouse=So I was going to china chili for lunch and on the way I passed this purple square building with bbq graffed all over it, naturally I hit my e-brake and made a u-turn straight out of the movie bullit. The place is a hole but the people who cook there truly love bbq, I got the ribs and a pulled pork sandwich with some purple drink (grape for the white kids)  to wash it down with. The ribs were dope for sure, my pork sandwich was aight but didn't hold a candle to the ribs. I like this place allot there are some service issues, but  when I left the bbq master was outside he yelled "hot did you like the Q" I smiled and threw him some thumbs. (i guess you had to be there)BRING CASH!!  just wanted to get that out of the way.  I  didn't catch it when I was reading reviews so now you know. We will definitely be back to Smokehouse. Although not much for decor , this little building serves big flavor.We loved the Pull Pork , Brisket Sandwich, Fried Chicken and my new favorite , smoked corn . Delicious! We went about dinnertime and there was lots of room and pretty fast service.Word... that's best way I can say it... I've had better. I really had crazy high hopes for Stacy's. Pulling up to the former corner store, I could smell the smoke in the air and felt my hopes rise even further away from me. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but I knew I wanted it to be good. Walkin' in, I saw the "They love on YELP" sticker and was so glad. Stacy's is good and unfortunatly... he knows it. We looked over the sign and wasn't sure what to get. My mom ordered the small beef sandwich with onion rings. I started to order, but then stopped my self and was given a smart ass remark from the cashier. My bad... dang. Ummm let me get the large pork sandwich with sweet fries and small cole slaw and grape kool-aid. Our order came to nearly $20 For a simple lunch!!We waited and sat and heard some slimely businessmen talking about titties, cigars and cars... *shudder* overhearing their conversation made me regret being straight. gag. Our food was brought to our table and I was... underwhelmed. The fries looked limp and lifeless, like they were rememnts from the past lunch hour. not at all cruncy or flavorfull... besides the sugary cinammon sprinkled atop them. The sandwich was okay... but just okay. It reminded me of manwhich with extra liquid smoke. the cole slaw was uninspired (Who knew cole slaw needed inspiration?) It needed heavy doses of pepper and a kick of salt to be decent. The Kool-Aid was too sweet to drink and I wound up chugging a third of it before adding some water to it and then was able to ward off diabetic coma for that day. My mom liked her sandwich but didn't like that it was SOO small! She was really disappointed but liked the flavor and wanted more. She also liked her onion rings, I had a couple and they were good. I want to give it another go. Because so many people liked it, it has to be good... right?! It could have been a bad day or something, I'm really hoping it was. Because based off of my experience... best BBQ in the city?? Hardly!Now that Arizona has passed legislation making it illegal to:* Roll your "R's" in the word "Burrito";* Elide the "N" in "Jalapeño";* Accurately pronounce "Chipotle" and "Habenero", and * Greet anyone by saying "Hola!"I figured it was time to sort out what I'm going to do for a little spicy food when there aren't anymore places that will sell me a great taco or quesadilla (I'm safe with those words for my review, since the law was just signed, it's not in effect, yet:)Since Arizona is becoming Texas "Lite", I figure that "Q" will be a safe harbor (much like the British Virgin Islands have become a safe harbor for most of my money).With that in mind, I decided to get busy finding my little BBQ spots around the greater Dalla...er...Phoenix Area...yeah...the Valley of the Sun...that's the ticket!I've tried a few...I really liked the recently departed Kinfolks (he went back to Oakland...something about an inhospitable business climate, here...go figure).After sort of detoxing at squash today, I stopped off for a little lunch at Stacy's Smokehouse.Funny story about that...I've discovered that there is almost nothing more demoralizing to my squash opponents that taking a couple of pulls of Macallan 18 from my flask just before a squash match ("what, he thinks he's good enough to play me...drunk!!!!").If I beat them (and I do often enough) it really makes for great bragging rights...if I don't win...Hey, I'd had a couple of belts! :)Win/Win!Stacy's is in the old ammo bunker that used to house Turk's Fish and Chips (home of the best fish & chips in Arizona...but they're gone now so let's move on) and this isn't a location that really seems to be conducive to a successful business...(although this spot is certainly appropriately "divey").Nevertheless, they have a bunch of framed awards on their "look at me" wall, proclaiming them as the best of this and that...but that's what different opinions are for...to start fistfights:)And my opinion differs...I didn't actually think that my pulled pork was the best in town...I tried several things at Stacy's today...pulled pork, a couple of sauces, French fries, beans, fried pickles (hey!...I was hungry...playing squash with a buzz is hard work:), and while the food was good, fine, decent, OK...it wasn't transcendent.I like that they smoke their own meat (insert joke here) and make their own sauces, and all that, but the Q was just pretty average (just off the top of my head, you've got BobbyQ's and Scottsdale BBQ that will both put this place in the shade).But it wasn't down to Honey Bear's level...and it's miles ahead of Dickie's Pit (involuntary shudder).Give Stacy's a try...it certainly not bad Q, and we do all have to select authentic American food choices now...I know I'll be back...if someone else is buying:)3.5 stars...although I don't round up:)My hope is that once Arizona completes the Texasizanation process, that places like the Goode Co., and Drexler's and even Bryan's will move here to Housto...oop's, I mean Phoenix...give us more great Q choices...as long as they don't try to sell us anything with Chipotle's in it!Oh yeah...the emoticon's are back...be very afraid:-)
Mamma Mia=It was a dark and gloomy Sunday night in downtown Phoenix. It was 6:30 Pm. On any other day in this city the streets would be lit up with restaurants eagerly proclaiming "we're open! we're open! come on in! give us your money!" But not on Sundays. On Sundays everyone closes their doors and goes home. As invisible as magic, unicorns, and Mariah Carey's acting talent. It was Nathan's birthday, and Amanda B and I took it upon ourselves to devise a place suitable for a birthday dinner. You might as well have asked us to perform brain surgery with a screwdriver and a plunger."Two Hippies?""Closed.""That BBQ place you like?""Closed.""Um...there's a Pizza Hut---""Uh, no.""Sorry."Yeah. Guess which one I was in that exchange.Finally we came upon Mamma Mia's, and collectively griped at how we had forgotten our "freebie" chips from the Birthday pARTy. Thankfully, they were open, though you wouldn't have known it by the way the girl ushered us through the kitchen to the dining room.There are two types of people who order pizza. There are those who, when asked their preference, list all the toppings they like. And there are those who respond by listing all the things they don't like on pizza. With the latter option, everyone gathers around the menu and lists off what available toppings they wouldn't eat. Through the process of elimination, you pick from the available toppings and come with a democratically agreed upon pie.And that's how we decided on basil and fresh tomato slices. With a side order of meatballs."How many meatballs come in a side?" asked Nathan."Five.""That's perfect."At first I was skeptical. How is five perfect for a party of three people? Who taught you to do math, birthday boy? Big Brother?Thankfully I kept those thoughts to myself...I know, even I was impressed with myself.And I'm glad I did, because the meatballs were big, saucy and  spoonable, since our party of three only managed to get two sets of plastic silverware. I guess it's not just Nathan who's math is a little fubar'd.The pizza was rather superb. So superb that, even armed with only basil and tomatoes, it was enough to satiate a palette accustomed to deep dish pepperoni sausage with buffalo sauce and buffet breadsticks.This was like re-education for my taste buds, but without the hard labor and Chinese man screaming in my face about how awesome communism is.The question about whether my hair was real or not aside, the staff were  accommodating and friendly. If I ever find myself lost in the dark and lonely place that is downtown Phoenix on a Sunday after 6pm, I will definitely keep Mamma Mia's in mind. And I will remember my "freebie" chips. Dear Phoenix,This isn't Salt Lake City. Cut this Sunday nonsense out.Love,MeAhhh Pizza......I love pizza.  Am I a pizza snob...yes and no.  If I have my choice, I would leave all the chains behind....Pizza Hut, Little Ceasers, Dominos, they are all blah.  Not alot of taste and the dough is just ....well...blah!  I seek out the local mom and pop joints, the ones that will sell by the slice and might make a pie that just melts in your mouth.Mama Mia''s is that gem!!  My friend had told me about it and since we have pizza and movie night every Satruday, this has been our place.  We order and I go pick up.  It's just up the street a few blocks from where we live so it's super easy.  The gentleman that usually makes the pizza looks straight outta New York/New Jersey.  It's him and his cousin running the show and he runs this place while his cousin runs the other location.  The crust is devine....like a thin crust should be and I can see myself walkin down the street in New York and ducking in for a slice.  This location is tiny though.  They have the kitchen and an area with about 4 tables and that's it.  I have parked in the back and every time I leave they let me go out the back door right to my car.  Nice.  This is my fave place in Phoenix so far.  I totally love it!  Mom and Pop shop at it's best.  If you have not tried Mama Mia's........what are you waiting for???  Go..........NOW!!I was met at the back door.  Yes, I'm your back door girl!  Parking here can be a bitch, as well as pulling into the place...but when you get there...Heaven!I got a cheese and garlic pizza to go.  I pulled into the parking lot and they said my name.  Stalker?  Nope.  Just good service, I guess.  Or maybe they know what a pain it is to park in back and walk allllllll the way around the building to get to the front door?  Anyway...This is true East Coast pizza.  Thin crust, proper sauce and amount and loads of dripping cheese.  Tons of crushed garlic, too!  My first time there, I chatted with the owner.  He actually uses Frank's for his wings!  Hey, I'm from Buffalo.  I *know* wings!  I didn't have them, but he did let me try the sauce.  Perfecto!Huge, East Coast slices, too.  The kind you have to fold in half to eat it, with grease dripping down your hand to your elbow.  THIS is what pizza is supposed to be!!!I've become a fan of Mamma Mia's.  They throw down some good NY style pies.Yous wanna go haves on a pie, I'll meet yous at Mamma Mia's.Yesterday was the first time I had been to this location.  We grabbed a quick lunch around some work I had to take care of and a funeral.  They always have some kind of deal going for 2 slices and a drink, around 4 bucks.  Big  tasty slices of delicious NY style thin crust pizza and a drink for $4 bucks.  Why would anyone go to a fast food joint when there is a Mamma Mia's nearby?I have 2 more reviews on the way for the microcosm of food that exists at the intersection of 7th St. and Indian School.I really should never have tried Mamma Mia's. The same way I should never have tried Two Hippies Burger joint (which is conveniently located next door). In fact, that's where I was headed at the time but they were closed. Being a fairly clean eater, my body does not know what to do with itself during these Sunday grease fueled gorge fests I seem to put myself through after a night of debauchery. My stomach hates me!I had a slice of plain cheese and a slice of pepperoni and yes, I devoured both. Quickly, quietly and with the stealth of a truly seasoned binge eater. Damn it was good. The slices were huge and foldable with the crust being the perfect combination of crispy and chewy. Delicious! The only complaint I have is that it's hot as hell in there. Not much can be done about that, so it's merely an afterthought. Mamma Mia's is close to home and that makes me nervous. Nervous is good. It means I have a crush on you...  *blush*
Cafepino=I stopped by Cafepino over the weekend for a family lunch (2 adults 2 kids) and had one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life. Short version: incredibly overpriced, bad food, incredibly rude and inefficient service.It started out well enough - I liked the atmosphere when we came in, and we were seated quickly. We were given a lot of different menus - apparently both breakfast and lunch/dinner items were available, and there were separate sheets with drinks and deserts. The menu was incredibly disorganized and confusing, so it took us a while to decide on the order.Eventually we decided on a couple of entrée items for the adults, two kids meals, a juice and a hot tea. This is where the trouble started. Our food took a very long time to arrive, and while we were waiting, two of the restaurant workers literally got into a shouting match a few tables away from us, which ended about 5 minutes later with one of the two storming out of the restaurant. The other person followed shortly thereafter, and their argument continued right outside, in plain sight of all customers since they were standing by the window right outside the restaurant. This series of exchanges took some effort to explain to our young children while waiting for the food.Since the restaurant was nearly empty, my guess as to the long wait for food is that perhaps one or both of the people arguing and storming out of the restaurant were supposed to be cooking and serving orders. No one stopped by to offer us some bread or small appetizer or at least to apologize about the long delay. When the food did finally arrive, it was incredibly bland and uninspired.Our kids were getting very restless by now, so I asked for the check shortly after the food arrived. I was assured that the check would be coming shortly. About 10 minutes later, our kids had enough waiting so my wife took the kids and left the restaurant, while I stayed behind to pay the bill. I made several more attempts to get the check, and was finally told that one of the people who stormed out of the restaurant in that shouting match earlier was the cashier, and they had called someone else to come in and take over, and asked me to be patient.While sitting there waiting to pay for this horror show, I watched several hapless waiters mis-deliver meals and beverages, bringing wrong food to the wrong people and having food turned away at the table numerous times.I spent about 30 minutes in which no one ever stopped by my table to offer me a complimentary beverage or dessert as a way to apologize for the long delay. To add insult to injury, when this "backup cashier" did arrive, he simply dropped the check on the table without so much as a glance at me, and ran off. And lo and behold, they simply billed me for the full amount - get this, $70 for two kids meals and two adult entrées, a juice and a hot tea.To recap - I sat through a shouting match which nearly came to blows (by restaurant employees), had to wait over half an hour for my check, and did not get so much as an apology for all that. An absolute nightmare of a restaurant, I will never go there again and wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy!Imagine what it would be like to eat an authentic french dip sandwich....A thin bread roll cooked to crusty, dark brown perfection in a brick oven, its crumb moist and chewy. Beef that's neither chewy or fatty, nor with any hint of gristle. Caramelized onions that add just the right amount of flavor.And all of this this topped with mozzarella cheese, delicious, authentic mozzarella cheese in the correct proportion to the meat...not so much as to create a chewy glob, yet enough to add even more flavor to an already delicious treat.Now add a flavorful au jus that doesn't rely on salt for its too too delicious taste.It's a fucking miracle this sandwich.A real life miracle.I've never experienced a french dip as heavenly as Cefepino's, making me conclude how one day when I decide to fuck-it-all...no longer eating sensibly or exercising, I'm going to live out the remainder of my days eating these things until I swell like a tick, pop and keel over.The service was highly attentive with a variety of new faces stopping by every few minutes to fill our glasses, wipe down the table between servings, or provide information relative to the menu choices. One of the servers even provided the background of the restaurant, which we learned has a long and storied history in Paris.The house chianti paired splendidly with my minestrone and french dip.A small (quarter sized) ramequin of horseradish was also served with the meal, it was slightly creamed and had a mildly strong flavor, in a word, supreme.Overall, this was an extremely pleasant dining experience.If you're a French bread aficionado and, you live in Phoenix Metro where you know there just aren't that many places to get hard crust, oven-fired breads, you have another option....Cafepino.Cafepino in my opinion is definitely a standout in the lineup of mediterranean eateries here in Scottsdale.
Chronic Cantina=Whenever I am in the mood to be a raging fat kid at lunch, this is my go to spot on Mill. Its seriously all disgustingly fattening, and all disgustingly delicious.. because usually, those two things go hand in hand. They've got the build your own burrito thing going on, which also applies for the tacos, nachos, quesadillas and tortas.. I usually get the carnitas burrito, with all my favorite fixings, and holy loaded burrito Batman, they do NOT skimp on the fillings. Its always too big to fit in my mouth, and always too big to finish the whole thing. Perfect for sharing. Today I tried the steak quesadilla, and on the side, just for fun, I decided to get the enchilada sauce for dipping. Its homemade, and perfect. Try this immediately. The staff are awesome and wicked fun.. They also don't nickel and dime you for salsa & sauces like other burrito/taco joints do. I hate it when that happens.The best part about this place is that its not just a place to scarf down fatty deliciousness while widening your waist size, they also have a full bar with tons of different tequilas, extremely eclectic decor, the chandelier is my personal fave and they are really big supporters of saving the tata's. They sell coozies that advertise this and all proceeds go towards finding a cure for breast cancer. So basically, if you love Mexican food, booze, and boobs, this is where you need to be. mmm.
Nine On Nine=I'm going to be all over the place with this review.  That will pretty much match the experience I had here.  First drink, PERFECTION!  I chose the White Grapefruit Cosmopolitan with Absolut Ruby Red, white cranberry juice and lime.  Second drink, not so much.  Way too much white cranberry juice and not enough Absolut.  No one likes a weak drink, lame!Since it was my first time here, I didn't realize that if you sit outside, you're only allowed to order off the bar menu.  I like that and I don't.  The "cheap" side of me likes it because, well, I'm cheap.  Cheap here equals $16 compared to $32 for a full menu item.  The other part of me thinks if it's a nice night out, why wouldn't I want to dine outside with a full menu.  Whatevs, no biggie.My eyes zeroed in on the Lobster Mac-N-Cheese, of course!  And for $16 it better be darn good!  Totally worth it.  The cheese was nice and creamy with big pieces of lobster and bread crumbs on the top.  I'd give that 4 stars!We also ordered a mix between a meat, cheese and Charcuterie Platter.  So the cheese, solid (how do you mess cheese up?).  Sweet pickles, best part of the platter.  The meat....straight outta the Giant Eagle deli section.  It was a poor mans excuse for prosciutto and bologne.  Gross.  Don't order!Factor in pretty inconsistent service between our server being there ALL the time to totally disappearing at the end of the meal when we wanted the check and you've got a iffy experience.I'm not throwing in the towel, I would come back and try out the full menu in the dining room.  All I would ask for is a complete package...that's not too much to ask for, is it?!***The chefs at Nine On Nine did a good job sourcing and cooking proteins (foie gras, squab); while I was not a huge fan of all of the flavor combinations, there is definitely good food here even if it is a little expensive***Nine On Nine is a fine dining spot located in Downtown Pittsburgh (not too far from PNC Park and apparently near some theaters in the city).  The restaurant has a small neighborhood restaurant or cafe feel with hardwood floors and an open (but cozy and not industrial) kitchen.The restaurant's decor feels very warm and approachable, but the menu sounds quite ambitious.  Nine On Nine has a tasting menu as well as ingredients you don't often see like squab.The bread was standard stuff.  There was a mix of focaccia, country bread and a decent and hearty fruit and nut bread.  The bread was sliced unevenly, but I did like the creamy whipped butter, which was topped with strong salt.I started with the seared foie gras, which was a small portion.  The foie gras was garnished with spring onion marmalade, brioche, gelatin, and crispy meringue-like pieces.  There were a lot of sweet elements on the plate, but they went well with the foie gras, which had an expected salty flavor.I thought the onion marmalade was very good--definitely sweet but still with an onion flavor.  I liked the brioche--great outside sear but still soft and moist.  The foie gras was good--buttery, creamy and flavorful.For my entree, I went with the squab, which featured both the breast and the legs.  The squab was served with hominy, chorizo, zucchini, arugula, and lemon.  I thought the squab was very good.  The breast was moist, juicy and tender.  It was a little like duck breast but had a bouncier texture.  The legs were crispy and good.I liked all the sides individually though it was not my favorite combination of flavors.  There was definitely a strong lemon flavor to the dish.For dessert, I had the coconut panna cotta, which was garnished with compressed pineapple, kiwi, pink peppercorn brittle, and a kaffir lime sauce.  The panna cotta was good.  It did not have a strong coconut flavor, but I liked the creaminess and lightness of it.The fruit was really good.  I liked the brightness, sweetness and tartness that the pineapple and kiwi provided.  The brittle was on the chewy side and did not have that crunch and snap you get with a lot of brittle (but I still liked it).  The brittle had a very strong pink peppercorn flavor.The kaffir lime sauce did not add much to the plate.  It did not have a distinct flavor.  It did not have a bad flavor, but I was not a fan of the consistency, which was kind of like snot.Service was good.  My server was pleasant, polite, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu.Prices were high.  Entrees were in the high $20s and $30s, which made Nine On Nine feel more expensive than Pittsburgh's Salt of the Earth (which seems like a more impressive restaurant).Nine On Nine is a good restaurant.  I thought they did a good job with the foie gras and the squab.  While I was not a huge fan of all of the flavor combinations (especially with the squab), I liked a lot of what was served.  I definitely enjoyed Avenue B more and thought Salt of the Earth felt much more original, but Nine On Nine is still a decent option for an upscale dinner in Pittsburgh.I am not sure what the parking situation is.  I think there are a few nearby paid lots.My experience here was a mixed bag.   We went in around 7:45 on a Friday evening without a reservation and were able to get seated before the bartender even had a chance to finish making my white grapefruit martini which was very refreshing.For dinner, I opted to start with the spring salad minus the pig ear bacon.   This was FABULOUS!!!  I would have ordered a second one if it wasn't $10.  I followed this up with the Tagliatelle Pasta (tomatoes, garlic and squash, oh my) which could have been amazing but was only so-so because I was served the most undercooked pasta ever.   The flavors in the dish were awesome.  I wanted to lick the plate but it was hard to get past the chewy pappardelle noodles (not tagliatelle) which were 2 minutes short of al dente.   I did mention this to the waiter who passed along the info to the chef which I appreciated (witnessed it since the kitchen is so open).We passed on a dessert which is a rarity because they just didn't have many options and the ones they did weren't up our alley.   I was craving cheesecake or some kind of fall dessert (maybe an apple turnover).Now here's the weird part.  When the bill came, there were only three items on the menu (my dinner wasn't listed).  I thought my pasta had been comped because it was so undercooked but then I realized the items in the bill totaled $16 less than the total bill  (ie something was in the total that wasn't in the itemized listing).  It just so happened to be my pasta.  When I pointed it out the waiter, he just said it was an error in the system.  Perhaps I'm reading into it, but I just thought it was shady that I was paying for it but it wasn't appearing on the bill.   I don't know; must be the accountant in me.The inside of the restaurant is pleasant and the service was so-so.  The waiter was a little inattentive given how few tables were filled.   Overall though, I was pretty pleased.   I really loved their use of flavors so I was more than willing to pay the higher-end prices but I was disappointed in my undercooked pasta.Why didn't anyone tell me to dine at Nine on Nine sooner, rather than later?  I feel so stupid!  I have been there twice in the past couple of weeks and I have worked not far from this place forever.  Somehow, I thought that this place was farther away than it is.  Oh, idiot, idiot , idiot! The décor and atmosphere of Nine on Nine reminds me of an intimate spot that you can go to, relax, eat, drink and be very merry!  There used to be this show back in the Nineties, called "New York Undercover" where one of the main character's father owned a nightclub.  Even though, the club was imaginary, somehow Nine on Nine gives me the same vibe, but in a restaurant version.  The only thing missing from this place, for me, is a live jazz trio strumming along quietly in the background.Now let's talk about the food and service...  Love, love, love the menu!  The appetizer and salad menu isn't really that expansive, but what they offer is lovely.  Daily Ceviche, soup, roasted chicken and salmon offerings that change based upon what's fresh at the market.  On a recent visit, they offered the chicken with a blueberry barbecue sauce and fiddlehead ferns.  WHAT???  In Pittsburgh???  Come again?  My buddies ordered their home-made cream of mushroom soup and I think that they may have wanted to order seconds.My buddies also ordered the Korean Barbeque Brisket with pickled vegetables, jalapeño peppers, Napa slaw, Sriracha mayo on a baquette.  I ordered the Crab Po' Boy with chive aioli, arugula and charred tomatoes served on a baquette.  Both sandwiches were served with Nine on Nine's Pomme Frites.  I love fresh cut fries and these were scrumpdillyicious, as well as the crabcakes!  My buddies also thoroughly enjoyed their brisket sandwiches. (They said that they would order the sandwiches again, but leave off the jalapeños.  Those jalapeño peppers kicked their azzes!)On another recent visit, I got the same Crab Po' Boy, but I ordered the Pommes Frites with black truffle aioli.  OMG!  (Picture Martin Lawrence in the background as his character Sheneneh, saying, "Oh mah goodneshhh!")   Seriously, my mouth is still watering a little, RIGHT NOW!  My lunch partner ordered the Fish Tacos with blackened fish, pico de gallo, avocado, cilantro, cabbage, spice crème and jalapeno peppers.  I wish that you could hear the sounds that we were making on both occasions.  (Picture Pac Man chewing through things with that sound he makes in the background.)  Ridiculous, I know, but sometimes you just have to surrender to your base instincts.I want to go to Nine on Nine for their Chef's Tasting.  At $90 per person, it's a little steep for a mom who pays quite a buck for their kid's high school tuition.  However, it's a treat that I want to meet sometime this year.  "I die" for Roasted Bone Marrow and I even have my teenage daughter Muff wrapped up in marrow love.  They have Roasted Bone Marrow here too, along with other dishes that I have swooned over in other cities!  Who knew and where have I been?Anyway, run and don't walk to Nine on Nine.  The staff will treat you with kid gloves and it may be your next home.
Papa John's Pizza=OK. So apparently some yelpers think reviewing chain or fast food restaurants is gauche. Well, bully for them. To each is own right. Me? Sometimes after a 12 hour day at work my empty stomach gets home to an empty fridge. Papa John's is open til 1AM. Hey, for Phoenix, that's pretty damn good. And while Domino's crust is similar to the cardboard disc that a frozen Tombstone sits on and Pizza Hut dough has more yeast than a yeast infection. Papa John's drives it home. Literally. Tangy, sweeter tomato sauce with crumbled, non grizzled Italian sausage and a perfect amount of cheese on a thin crust. My tummy was happy. I ordered it on line at work and when I got home I waited about 10 minutes before Papa showed. But I have my own name for him. I call him Daddy John. Oh yea. Thanks Daddy!
Yen Sushi & Sake Bar=Is it possible? Another 5 star review for a Sushi joint? Yes! Yes it is. I was going to have dinner with my BFAM, Kevin and decided to look up Sushi. I chose Yen due to the great reviews and BOY was I glad that I did. We were greeted and chose to sit at the sushi bar. I suggested to Kev that we go Chef's choice all the way. Of course my brother said "Hell yeah" to that! The Chef was mildly surprised at the request but quickly warmed up to the idea. If he was aiming to blow our socks off, he was dead on. There is something about simply made, FRESH food that tends to wow me. He started us off with a sashimi plate to die for. It included salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and octopus. Amazing. Every slice was fresh, not even a hint of being old. The best way to describe the after taste is "Clean", no fishiness or weird after taste. The chef then presented us with thinly sliced striped bass with fresh wasabe. Amazing... amazing! The slices of bass were so thin, you could see the plate underneath. The next thing we ordered was eel. Now, I'm usually not a fan of eel because it seems gritty or greasy to me. When we were served the eel, I was surprised to find nothing of the sort on my plate. It was delicious! The eel was crisp and flaky from the broiling. The entire meal was great from start to finish. I can't wait to visit Yen again.One of the photos here shows a tempura battered jalapeno half filled with all sorts of goodness. All I have to say is: put-it-in-my-mouth. Last night's dinner at Yen was re-frickin-diculous. Dottsy suggested going balls to the wall with the Chef's Choice and she was not wrong. We started off with miso soup, then a small pickled cucumber salad. Then the sashimi plate arrived. As much as I wanted to scream "MINE!" and fight off my friends' advancing chopsticks, I held back. Salmon, tuna, albacore, yellowtail and octopus graced this huge display and each one was really mouth-watering. the octopus in particular was delicate and not at all rubbery. The tuna melted on my chopsticks before dissolving completely on my tongue. After we raided the sashimi plate we were delivered some baked roll that was inhaled before the server even left the table. I have to admit that after that roll we waited a good 20 minutes for another one to arrive, or even more. That was a bummer, but fortunately we had excellent company with whom to pass the time. In total we had the sashimi plate plus 5 rolls, which was a gut-busting affair. We completemented our meals with big ole sapporos and a few people had sake(bombs). All in all the measure of a sushi place is how fresh their cuts of fish are and Yen is tied for first on my list of best sushi places. The $60 per person price tag was a little scary but I do feel like the quality warranted the price tag, if not the quantity of rolls. And even though this is a hike, I will be back because of the spectacular work they did with their fish.Ugh ..I wanted to like Yen. But I am thinking it was never meant to be. My husband warned me that I wouldn't like it. And that it was pricey. But I was  determined to prove him wrong and took  my girls.  As we entered I immediately had a great vibe, rich dark wood , cozy ,  but tasteful and clean. No overbearing screaming TV, no tacky decor. I knew I was going to love this place. Then to find out they had a Happy Hour Sushi Menu , I was quite pleased. But that is where it began to fall apart. As  soon as she brought me my Diet Coke in a can I was frightened.Nothing good comes of coke in a can with a meal unless you are serving pizza or brats off a cart.After discussing with the waitress that the 10 year old wanted sashimi with nothing on it  ,hers arrived with chives , white radishes  and and oniony soyish sauce... Her two plates of sashimi were quickly pronounced "gross".  Even I didn't like one of them.( they did comp that item ) My Happy Hour sushi was blah, no pizzazz  except  the cream cheese chunk in the Phil. roll.   Teenager Daughter acted like she liked her Teriayki  but when pressed for a review gave it only 3 out 6 stars aaaahhhh.  The edadame was fresh and tasty   but I am thinking that's not enough to get my girls back.  I on the other hand really want to like it so if you are willing to buy me dinner and a diet coke I'll try it again.Very bad service.Long wait, rude waiter, have to wave down waiter to get service.Happy hour prices are good, rolls are cheap but not worth the service tradeoff.I'll never go back, and neither will any of my friends.I went there for the happy hour but left after I got pissed after being treated like a door mat.Found an even better place 2 miles west, Tokyo Lobby.Friendly greeting, good service, better happy hour, and $5 large sake bombers ALL day long.K Sushi on 43rd and Olive has the best roll i've had though, Nebraska roll, its awesome.Don't know their happy hour prices but they have $24.95 all you can eat.....I got 6 orders of rolls....They have 50 state rolls, one named after every state, plus all the traditional rolls.My money works the same in every restaurant, but Yen will never get another dime.OMG THIS IS MY 500th REVIEW!  HOLY COW I CAN"T BELIEVE I MADE IT THIS FAR! Plus, it was my birthday on Tuesday the 12th, which makes it an even BETTER week!But, here's how our Friday afternoon happy celebration went:So a bunch of us girls decided to do happy hour after work today, and one of my coworkers suggested this place. I don't eat sushi often, and usually need help ordering since I have no clue what I'm doing!Upon entering, I really liked how the place was set up. Cute tables, with a great Asian flare.  Not flashy, but not understated either. My friends helped me order off the happy hour menu, and the food was delicious! I went with a deep fried california roll, along with another dish that I split with my friend. I can't remember the name of it, but I do know it had pink fish on top with white rice underneath.The service was a bit slow at first, but eventually got better as the night went on. We were getting antsy to order, and kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting some more. Eventually the service picked up, but it took a little bit. We had a big table and there were lots of mouths to feed, so it was evened out in the end.Overall, I was happy with eating here.  Plenty of food, great menu, and amazing happy hour prices.  Place was packed, so get there early so you can get a seat and get your grub on from 3-5.
Ribshack BBQ=Worst BBQ ever! Bland, flavorless and over priced (see below). We were hoping that this place would be a knock out considering it's just but the house.. to our disappointment this place is horrible.. took a few bites and the pork tasted so old that we tossed the rest in the trash. Whats funny is that the guys working saw us throw the meat out but didn't ask what the problem was.. ah well.. the lemonade here was awesome though.. some of the best lemonade Ive had in ages! I'm actually surprised that this place isn't out of business yet as its always empty.. a real shame.. we were SO excited when we first saw the banner go up.. maybe they can turn it around before its to late though I'm afraid to go back.When I say over priced I mean when you order 15 bucks of food then throw it in the trash because it tastes old, then leave hungry, well don't you think thats over priced?My husband wanted gelato, so we decided to check out the newly remodeled Bashas' in the same plaza.  After perusing the aisles unsuccessfully trying to decide what to have for dinner, we settled on Italian take-out, but then it turned to Oriental Garden, and somehow we ended up with BBQ.  It is Memorial Day after all.First time here, and for $21 we got a sampler than included 1/2 lb each of pork, chicken, and beef with 3 sides and cornbread.  Here's the lowdown on our experience.-Chicken was very dry and I didn't care for the flavor at all.  Of course, smothered in sauce, it was better.-Beef was sliced thin and reminded me more of a deli-style meat than a BBQ.  It wasn't bad, just not what I wanted.-Pork was the best, but I've still had better.  Not smoky or flavorful enough on its own.-I liked both the mild and the spicy sauces luckily.-Cole slaw-I've never been a cole slaw fan, but I liked it.  My husband who dislikes almost any cole slaw except KFC liked it as well.-Potato salad-Although it needed salt, it was okay.  I liked that it was NOT sweet or swimming in mayo.  I think it would be better with the potatoes peeled, since they use a standard russet and the skins were tough.-Baked beans-I really liked these as they were not in some thick disgustingly sweet syrup.-Corn bread-Delicious with whole kernel corn and rosemary, I believe.Overall, I would go back since close to home, but I'll stick with the pork..with the sauce and a salt shaker nearby.  And next time, I won't have gelato first so I can try their cobbler if it's available!Sorry to say this next-door BBQ spot is lacking...I have tried it three times now... each time I find myself wondering why I am here again. The decor is just plain sad... something between a fast food taco shop and a dollar store. The service is SLOW!!! REALLY SLOW!!!Popped by here for the last time on Saturday night with my kids. Two half-racks of over-cooked ribs and three mac and cheese orders with a can of diet coke set us back over $40. Which I would have gladly paid at Joe's, Waldo's, or even Famous Dave's. To be fair - on my first visit and (when they still seemed to care) my pulled pork sandwich was decent.I really wanted this place to do well since I can walk here, but alas it seems they are barely hanging on and cutting corners.I was super stoked when I realized there was a BBQ joint close to my office... too bad it's just "OK".I couldn't really tell the difference in taste or looks between the pulled pork and the brisket.  Seriously.  It was weird.  The spicy BBQ sauce is garbage and literally looks and tastes like Ketchup with hot sauce added.  Bunk.  The Lemonade was, surprisingly, very watery and bland.  The side of beans was OK, nothing special.  Next!I was recently introduced to Scottsdale BBQ Co by fellow Yelpers who Know Their Food.  As I enjoyed my juicy burger that day, I knew two things to be true: 1) this place would make a great lunch spot for my perpetually hungry co-workers (guys like BBQ, what can I say?), and 2) I could not die happy without trying the tri tip sirloin sandwich.  So, back at the office I warned everyone to break out their "big stretchy pants" and get ready for a field trip to Fantastic BBQ Land.We piled in on a Friday ready to EAT.  Right off, everyone appreciated the down-home, no-frills feel, complete with a loud screen door, gingham tablecloths and the specials listed out on a chalkboard.  After chatting with the owner (who is super cool, by the way) we all ended up with either tri-tip sirloin or pulled pork sandwiches, all with the most amazing spicy BBQ sauce you will ever taste.I had the sirloin tri-tip I had been thinking about since my last visit.  So worth waiting for!  Huge - I couldn't finish it (and I really, really tried).  My side, of course, was mac n cheese which I promptly decorated with Tabasco.  Mac n cheese o' fire!  Others had baked beans, potato salad, mac n cheese sans tabasco (silly boys, afraid of the burn...), and caesar salad.  The caesar looked especially good, with nice slivers of parmesan gracing the top.  I stole a few.  Ok, more than a few... All in all, everyone walked out happy (and ready for a nap!).  It was a messy, good, 6-napkin per person experience.I would recommend you get down to Scottsdale BBQ for some downscale, down-home, downright delicious BBQ and southern cooking.  If Yelp had a rating system that allowed a higher degree of detail than single stars I would put them at about 3.5 but I rounded up based on the value for your money here.I shared a family platter,  $22.95 or so, with my family.  A full slab of ribs, 1/2 pound of pulled chicken, two sides and dessert.The ribs were yummy as was the potato salad and the mandarin side salad.  I had an extra side of red beans and rice which were ok, not quite as good as the other dishes.We finished with peach cobbler.  Outstanding!   Before we ordered it we inquired if it was made from canned peaches or fresh.  They make it from fresh peaches which they marinate on site.  Great cobbler.  I would come back just for that.The portion sizes on the sides and desserts is very generous so keep that in mind when you order.
Confusion Tapas Du Monde=There are plenty of hit or miss spots in this jumpin' area of St Denis, and Confusion starts off on the wrong foot by only opening at 5:30pm (totally unexpected on a street where the terraces are usually full of folks eating and drinking wine and sangria by noonish.) But it's got some mojo working for it - the outdoor patio is small and surrounded by a thick hedge making you feel like you're in a garden but still right in the swirl of action on the street. The indoor seating downstairs feels like a quirky, lush bistro carved into a 200 year old stone foundation. Some of the seating is booths, some is swings, which we avoided due to our pre-dinner drinks and general klutziness, but we are pro indoor swings in general. The tapas options are diverse, we enjoyed the duck rolls, chorizo, and scallops in particular. Everything was very flavourful and suited the fabulous if slightly boudoir decor. The service was friendly, funny and attentive.
La Bocca Urban Pizzeria + Wine Bar=I like seafood. I like pizza. So I ordered the seafood pizza. Big mistake. I had been waiting about 20 minutes for it when the waitress informed me that it didn't look good, and she'd asked the cook to start over. It didn't look good? What does that mean? Sounded like she was looking out for me, though, so I didn't complain. Well, I don't know what the first one looked like, but it couldn't have been good if it looked worse than the second one, which arriving another 20 minutes later, kind of looked like... soup! Seafood pizza soup. The sauce (1 part tomato sauce / 3 parts water?) was actually dripping off the plate. I tried to pull out a slice and all I got was soggy crust, because all the toppings, cheese included, slid right off and landed with a splash. The shrimp were mushy, like little bad bananas. The squid (I think it was squid, but I don't know that for sure) tasted like pencil erasers. Really Gross (that's right, that's no typo, that's Gross with a capital 'G').The waiter was placing a "They Love us On Yelp" sticker on the door when we walked up....COOL!I've never been a fan of that typical chopped tomato bruschetta.The Bruschetta here Was AAAMMMAAAAAZZIIIING!!! (see pics)They have 6 toppings and you get to choose 4.I chose the Roasted Artichoke, Caprese, Salami  Pesto and the Prosciutto, Fig & Truffled Marscapone...........Let me tell you the salami one I didn't care for the other were very good But Next Time I will Order ALL Prosciutto...UNBELIEVABLE right down to the Chewy toasted bread.I will be dreaming about it from now on I guarantee it!I also couldn't not resist anything with Mushroom and ordered the Truffled Harvest Mushroom Pizza (see pics)It had harvest mushrooms, melted tomatoes, goat cheese, baby spinach, white truffle oil.......WHOA! Scrumdiddlyumptious!I could have easily eaten the whole damn thing, but was nice enough to share a couple slices with my friend who only ordered ...."a salad"One more thing that sounded really good was the Turkey & Brie sandwich (see pics) it had oven roasted organic turkey, brie, fig, apple, lettuce, tomato, ciabatta. Accompanied by your choice of seasonal couscous, house-made coleslaw or seasoned potato chips.I chose the cous cous.Compared to the other mouthwatering delights this sandwich really fell short ,neither my daughter or I really cared for it ......the bread was not even up to par with the other breads we tasted and the turkey was a bit dry. However the Cous Cous Was Fantastic!!! I would love to have ordered just some of that.I will go back for sure.I've never been to Postino so I cant make the comparison like some of the others and I thoroughly enjoyed it so who cares anyway!So I went back to La Bocca. Didn't enjoy my last experience - the service or the food - but with all the other positive Yelp reviews out there, I decided to give them another chance. And I'm glad I did. Because this time was better. Not awesome, but definitely better. Up from two stars to three.Last time I ordered the seafood pizza, which was Gross, which I didn't even see on the menu anymore. Hmmm... wonder what happened there.This time I ordered the Oven Roasted Shrimp and Pesto Sandwich, which was quite tasty. Kind of tasted like bruschetta actually, but with pesto and shrimp. Which was fine with me - I love bruschetta. Bread was lightly toasted, shrimp were plump and juicy. Choice of sides included cole slaw, couscous and chips. I got the chips, and they weren't bad, just your basic restaurant potato chips. My friend ordered the Turkey & Brie Sandwich with the couscous. She enjoyed the sandwich, but not the couscous so much. It was served cold, which I don't think she was expecting.Service was definitely better this trip - friendlier and much more efficient. We were in and out in about an hour. Weird thing was we were the only ones there. I mean, I know it's Monday, but still - only one table between 11 & 12? That can't be good.La Bocca was on my radar since it opened earlier this year... I cannot believe how long it took me to finally get there, but it was worth the wait.  I went with a group of four on a Monday night.  (1/2 Price Bottles of Wine from 5pm - close on Mondays; needless to say, we took advantage of that special!)We let my friend Anthony do the ordering since he'd been many times before and he also has a vested interest of sorts... We started with two salads: the prosciutto, zucchini, and artichoke (my favorite) and the goat cheese and pear... also quite tasty.  You can't go wrong with either one.  We then had the truffled harvest mushroom and the spiced pepperoni pizzas.  Yum!  The thin crust and the combination of fresh ingredients on both of them were perfect!  Along the way, owner Julian Wright sat down with us to share some wine and conversation - he's fantastic!  While he was completely engaged in talking to our group, I could tell he was also constantly surveying the restaurant to make sure all was running smoothly.  Every patron that walked in the door received immediate attention including our group.  Our waitress was sweet and I liked that she gave some attitude back to Jared when he was joking around with her.We had a blast on top of a great meal and ended up staying for hours enjoying  two bottles of wine (maybe more than that as I lost track) during that time.  One of them was a La Crema Pinot Noir, but I think we had a merlot as well and maybe another Italian Red.  I guess I'll have to go back and take notes next time.  Another reason to return will be to try the brusschetta - it sounds amazing.  I have a feeling it won't take me as long to return to La Bocca as it took for me to get there in the first place.  You can't go wrong at La Bocca if you're looking for pizza, salad, wine, and all in a warm, welcoming atmosphere.  Check out their other daily pecials too - I know I will!Finally tried out this new wine bar/pizzeria. I didn't have too many great expectations, as I had read the ever-insightful Kristen's review noting that this was "a starter wine bar for college kids."It is, but considering what else Mill Ave/Downtown Tempe has to offer, I'll still take it! Ha ha. First, I love the décor; they're one of the few Tempe area restaurants to pick up that more downtown Phoenix vibe and style. The quirky celebrity photos lining the wall by the ladies' room make me smile - I want to be in those pictures! What are they doing? Is that Cate Blanchette smoking a joint on the john?? The giant portrait over the bar is pretty cool too.OK since I have an issue with brevity, I'll try to make short comments on the basics: Service: Pretty good. Came in for a quick drink on the patio one day and the server was incredibly friendly, cool and actually helpful (I'm always shocked by mature and efficient service on Mill Ave, which is littered with student hosts/bartenders/servers who act bored, annoyed and are slow and simply don't give a damn - I'm looking at you, RA).  Service cont'd: When I came back for dinner our server was still good, and the poor guy had to deal with the fact that this restaurant does not appear to have its shit together at the moment. Case in point - checked the web site for price range before committing. (Btw I LOVE when restaurants have their entire menu, including prices for food AND drinks online; this one does.) On their home page, they list their daily specials, and Sunday was half-off bottles. Show up and have to sit at the bar for a minute because they appear to be in the aftermath of a Gammage pre-show rush. No prob. I ask the bartender if there's a separate menu for the half off bottles. His gruff response: "We don't do that." Then stares at me. No explanation, no follow up, no suggestions/alternatives. So I bring it up with the server because I want answers. His explanation was sort of a meandering list of a couple of reasons that just kind of sounded like the restaurant didn't wan to do it anymore. Tried ordering or asking about a couple other things (I wanted a wine they no longer carried but still on the menu and asked too about the Sunday movies) and he uncomfortably explained the restaurant is doing a lot of "restructuring" right now and things are changing and information on the menu and web site is outdated. Kind of annoying when you hear that about three requests/questions in a row. Food: Pretty damn good. The organic seasonal happened to be a white pizza with merlot soaked mushrooms and spinach. For $11 it was big enough to share for two who aren't starving. Or you can share a salad or app as well. The ingredients were delicious and were of good quality, not to mention the crust was ... I don't know that I can even explain it. Grilled and chewy and buttery and soft and wonderful all at once. Glasses of red started at $7, and yes were of pedestrian choices, mostly from Cali - if you have a local organic pizza, maybe have local wine too? Kudos for having homemade sangria on the menu (giving Caffe Boa a real run, eh?) Décor/atmosphere: see first graph for décor. Atmosphere was nice. Low key, they turned the lights down pretty low and servers are laid back. Loud in the large, open space though. Couches with tables (though the here the tables are actually lower than the seat, so would make for an awkward eating arrangement) are scattered throughout along with regular tables and some tall seating as well as a short bar area. You have the exact opposite issue if you sit at the long booth in the middle of the room, as those small tables are much higher than are comfortable - I feel like my wine glass was at neck level! Patio is nice with tables and couches as well.  So, all in all, I judge it on a relative scale because, well, there's really nothing else like it in the area (nearby CB is much pricier). p.s. hey, remember when I said I was going to be brief? Ha!Before I get to review La Bocca, I need to deal with legal "fine print". It's called "fine print" because it will make everything "fine" if you handle it correctly (you'll just have to trust me on this...I am a highly trained "businessman").The "fine print" disclaimer for this review follows:The Beautiful Carin is the sister of Peter, one of the managers of La Bocca. As such, I receive (and, hopefully will continue to receive, as long as we both shall live...it's in our marriage vows:), "special treatment" at La Bocca. That "special treatment" includes: Great Service; Great Food; Great Conversation; Great Atmosphere...hang on...Peter says La Bocca treats everybody that way...crap, I thought I was "special".OK, weasel words out of the way, on to the review. The Beautiful Carin and I wanted to go back to La Bocca for dinner and last night was the night!The beautiful Carin's brother, the Cordial and Talented Restaurateur, Peter greeted us with a welcoming hug (he may or may not do that for you...you'll just have to marry one of his sisters yourself and see), and we sat down.The joint was jumpin'... Friday evening in downtown Tempe always seems to have lot going on. We had Matt as our server and he was friendly and attentive, got us drinks and some outstanding warm olives and crusty Italian bread...I could have made a meal of that alone! I didn't...I needed to build up calories for my work out this morning. Last night, I hadn't eaten anything since the  1/2 chicken and waffle at Lolo's for lunch...I was famished:)We ordered bruschetta...they have a very nice selection ranging from standard tomato/mozzarella to minced Queen Creek olives on ricotta. We had had a couple of these at the OYE last Sunday evening and they were good then and they were good last night!We had a little time as we enjoyed our wine and appetizers and sort of surveyed the room. I was really pretty interested in whether we were getting the friends and family treatment or whether our experience was pretty typical...It seemed like the typical experience. Matt was handling 3-5 other tables, at the same time as ours, and they were all smiling and happy. It was the same story throughout the place...everybody looked like they were having a good time:)Our salads arrived...Carin had the Caprese and I had a Caesar...here's where I figured I was getting the "insider" deal. I like anchovies (I know, go figure:) and Matt asked the kitchen to put some on my salad, since they don't generally do that. I whispered my "thanks" to him, because I didn't want the other diners to become agitated that I was getting something they could never hope to get...but Matt said in a loud voice, "no, anyone who wants anchovies can have them"...another perk, dashed!We ordered 2 pizza's...the Porko (pulled pork, caramelized onions and serrano peppers...tasty and spicy) and the meat something (I don't always remember the names, but 3 meats, olives and I added serrano's to that one...yum:)Nicely done pizza's...hot and gooey cheese, fresh and high quality toppings, crispy with a just a little blackening around the edges. Plenty to eat and we had leftovers to take home!Finally, we did dessert at La Bocca last night (last time I was here, my "offsite" dessert experience, while memorable, was less than a complete success:)They make a chocolate brownie with liquid chocolate/espresso center. They put ice cream on top and drizzle it with caramel...and crack, apparently. I was just going to have a bite...I hoovered this thing down so fast I think I embarrassed my sweet beautiful and indulgent wife (who did manage to get a bite or 2 of the dessert, but not much more). In spite of the spoon and napkins, I still looked like a 2 year old with his first soft serve chocolate ice cream cone.So, what's the upshot...Peter, I hate to say it, but even if you never work another day at La Bocca, I'm going back...often. In the meantime, I expect some special treatment the next time I go in! If you want special treatment, you need to go find one of Peters other marriageable sisters (he has 14 of them) and get yourself in the family...or just go in to La Bocca and tell them I sent you:)And give Peter a hug...he enjoys it...trust me;)Great pizza, with an ingredient list that is actually fairly unique.  This is also a place to go for build-your-own, if you're into that kind of thing.  I like to experience the chef's creations, so I order from the menu.  Last night I sampled (like I'm going to tell you how much I ate!!) both the truffled mushroom pizza and the bocca trio.  The mushroom pizza was nearly overwhelmed by the spinach, but the truffle oil and the goat cheese managed to shine despite the subtle flavor of each.  I personally believe mushrooms don't taste like anything, they just are, so I can't comment on their quality.  The other pizza, the Bocca Trio, is a bit like a good old-fashioned meat-lovers' pizza from Pizza Hut in that it has three different meats on it.  There the similarities end; the menu name-drops Genoa and Schreiner's as the source of the salami and sausage, respectively, not deigning to attach any adjectives to the pepperoni.  The whole package works fairly well, with the olives and the cheeses and the tomatoes and everything.  One thing I did notice in going back and forth between the two was that there was a quite marked difference in done-ness.  The crust of the Trio was quite charred, while the other pizza had no black at all.  I'm not sure if this was intentional (I thought it was the styles worked for each pizza) or a side-effect of the enormous rush on the kitchen.  I love La Bocca for offering to hold large events, but if the kitchen and staff can't handle the rush, perhaps we need to look elsewhere.  The pizza size seems a bit smaller than elsewhere - I would recommend a hungry couple split three or try a generous bruschetta plate to take the edge off.  For the sweet-toothed, I also sampled a pizza cookie, on which I can't pass judgement, and a very creamy portion of the tiramisu, which I found to be fantastic.  In the end, this place misses out on the fifth star because of the service I've had on two visits.  Granted, no small or even medium-sized restaurant would not be overwhelmed by the groups I was part of, but La Bocca seems to be over-promising, biting off more than they can chew.  The wait staff tries hard, they really do, but the kitchen simply takes too long to get stuff out the door.  I might add the fifth star back if I get a chance to check this place out on a date night when it's more normal.  I think the pieces are certainly all there - I love the vibe of this place.I think people generally go to a pizzeria and bar type place for three basic things:1) Food2) Drinks3) ServiceSince I could get neither food nor drink, I can only speak to service.And I think I just did.I am not exaggerating here. I was in La Bocco for an hour before a server approached. While the pizza looked fabulous, I'd heard people talking about getting theirs 30, 45 minutes or more after they ordered. So I opted for a beer.30 minutes after that, with only one fleeting glimpse of the server, I left.Yes, it was crowded. Yes I was there for the Ignite Phoenix after-party. But it's not like it was standing room only, and they had previous notice we were coming.Walking out after an hour and a half to find your car towed (clearly not La Bocca's fault, and not a factor in the one star review) makes for a pretty lousy experience. Too bad, looked like a cool place. But seriously, it's not that difficult to pour a beer.And don't park, ever, on the southeast corner of Mill and 7th street.UPDATE: I just had to stop back by and give props to the owner Julian, who contacted me via Yelp and apologized for my poor experience. No excuses, no fluff. That's commendable, and the right way to do business. I'll have to go back and take him up on that drink offer....After my introduction to La Bocca at an Official Yelp Event recently I was impressed enough to pay another visit.I had someone visiting from corporate.  Like me, he travels frequently and likes to check out interesting food and see new places.  So I thought Mill Ave. and La Bocca would fit the bill nicely.We split bruschetta and a pizza, both were outstanding.  The bruschetta selections were as follows:  caprese with fresh pulled mozzarella - very nice.  roasted tomato, pesto & parm - also very nice with a robust pesto.  queen creek olives & ricotta - love the olives!  and the standout - prosciutto, fig & mascarpone - wonderful!  I first had the combo of fig and prosciutto at a reception in Berkeley and loved it then.  We had the porco pizza.  Another interesting combination with pulled pork, serrano chili's and other good stuff.  The thin roasted crust at La Bocca is a hit with me!The service was good but I did get a sense the server wanted to be somewhere else.  Oh well.  Overall a solid experience and I will be back.They did have a terrible time keeping up with the food at the Yelp event to the point that I was actually waiting with others by the kitchen door to try and nab some food before it was gone.Voted one of the top 25 restaurants by Phoenix Magazine, this urban chic eatery lives up to its accolades."La Bocca" literally means "the mouth."  What I love about this name is that in Buenos Aires, Argentina there is a district called "La Boca," where the Italian immigrants settled at the turn of the century.  The name is perfect for a restaurant that serves an amalgam of Latin inspired fares.The vivid photographs on the wall display an enchanting and colorful Italy, the large mural behind the bar is reminiscent of a Spanish royal portrait.  The colors of the dining and bar area are earthy, warm, and inviting - with dramatic splashes of red to infuse the senses.Seated at the bar, I was impressed by the bartender's attentiveness, and his unmatched skill in making the best mojito this side of Miami.  This was a drink that I would expect to pay $14 for in North Scottsdale.  At La Bocca, the cocktails are $7 and worth the drive.  Their signature drink is the "Clean Slate Martini," which was recommended by the amiable owner, Mr. Julian Wright.  He explained that the combination of Tanqueray, cucumber, and lime made this a smooth concoction, but I am so thrilled that I opted for the incredible blackberry mojito.This being a pizzeria, the wine list is varied and interesting.  Many of the wines are Californian, but Spain is also well represented here.  For those who enjoy whites with their pizzas, I recommend their Senorio de Cruces Albarino (Spain) - perfect with salads, pizzas, or pastas.  For a real taste of Italy, get a bottle of their Zenato Rippassa del Valpolicello (Italy) - this is a well-rouned red that is served in every Italian restaurant in Europe.There is only one place in Phoenix Metro where I believed I could find good bruschetta, (Postino) but a new contender has just entered the ring.  La Bocca offers the same - an assortment of bruschettas which can be ordered in combinations of four.  The selections range from prosciutto, mascarpone, fig, and truffle oil, to salami and house-made pesto.  And just like Postino, the rich flavors make your culinary heart melt with joy.Pizza lovers can build their own pies here, with topping choices such as heirloom tomatoes, pulled pork, chili oil, and garlic.  There are seven signature pizzas on the menu, which can easily by devoured by one guest, and range from $9-$14.  There are also sandwhiches and salads available for those who do not like the pie.If you are coming here strictly for wine, cozy up in one of the comfortable seats in the lounge.  Order a bottle of Spanish wine, and get the "anti-asti" plate.  This comes with a delectable assortment of salami, prosciutto wrapped goat cheese, manchego cheese, pesto, queen creek olives, roasted garlic, dijon, and artisan toast.  A spanish picnic, with the best pesto in town.So, if that wasn't enough to pique your curiosity - here are some extra incentives.Sundays and Mondays the bottles of wine are 1/2 off after 6:30 PM.Tuesdays enjoy your pizzas at 2-for-1 after 6:30 PMThursdays, impress your date with live musicFridays and Saturdays has reverse Happy Hour from 10 PM to closeAfter three unsuccessful attempts, I finally made it to La Bocca, and fourth time's a charm! The food was perfectly executed, the service on point and the ambiance relaxing and casual on a weekday afternoon.The order:Flight of three ice creams (sorbet - strawberry, lemon, basil, Maya Farm Mint with Chocolate Chips, Salted Caramel with Toasted Almonds) $5Bruschetta planks: pulled pork, housemade pesto, roasted red pepperMozz, basil, roma tomato, qc olive oil & balsamicMargarita pizzaWarm queen creek olives and artisan toastMediterranean plate: basil hummus, babaganoush with warm feta, roasted peppers, queen creek olives, artisan toast and house made flat breadA 5-star experience all the way.My friend wanted to come here for dinner one evening...To start, we ordered the Mediterranean plate. This was a really good appetizer. But beware because it's hugeeeee!!!! I loved the hummus and the babganoush that it came with. The cheese was good but a bit salty. For the entree we shared the truffled mushroom pizza. This thing was delicious!!!! Like reallyyyyy delicious! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Lol for drinks I ordered the red sangria and my friend got the orange blossom martini. I wasn't too fond of my sangria. I think it could've been a bit sweeter. I would definitely come back for their pizza. They also have happy hour and reverse happy hour on the weekends that I'd like to check out. It's a really cute little pizza place. Perfect for a date or even dinner with friends. They have a great outdoor patio and it's right on Mill Ave. So good for people watching. =)
Sushi Ave=What even is the real name of this restaurant? Is it Kanpai as written on the door? Is it Kampai as written on the sign? I actually have no idea and for the sake of this review, it doesn't really matter. Here is what is important about this little restaurant on the west side of town. The two chefs who own and run this restaurant, brought sushi to the valley. No, I am not kidding and its not debatable, AJ and Yuki are the original gangsters of the sushi manifestation that has occurred in Phoenix. In order to understand this revelation, we need to go back to 1985(see what I did there). A small sushi restaurant opens in Paradise Valley, right across the street from the mall. It is called Shogun and for many years is the premier sushi restaurant in the valley. Actually, for a while, it was the only sushi restaurant in the valley. Shogun has gone through various restorations and renovations over the years, but originally, it was AJ and Yuki at the small sushi bar inside Shogun with around five or six tables. These sushi geniuses built Shogun into the dynasty that it was and after a few years, moved onto their own venture, named Kampai or Kanpai, depending on which signage you are currently viewing. Kampai, found in a very shady strip mall on Bell road, has the best sushi in the valley. There is not a close second. Yuki is the main sushi chef and AJ runs the back end kitchen. Word of warning and the reason for the lack of five stars in this review. If Yuki is not your sushi chef, I cannot vouch for the restaurant at all. I know I know, that sounds brutal, but it's the truth. Yuki is an artist and meticulous. The other chefs just are not in his league and some of the specialties of the house, only taste their best when made from Yuki's hands. What makes this place so special? It certainly isn't the decor, which could not be more plain. It is far from the waitress service that is at best, hard to understand. It is the fact that the spicy tuna hand roll is the best I have ever had. The southwest salmon roll, while not only amazing, is only found at this sushi bar, no matter where in the country I have dined on sushi. The southwest salmon roll Is an inside out roll, with salmon and a house cured chili pepper with cucumber and masago on the outside. It is my favorite sushi roll on the planet. As for the sushi, this is the only place in the valley, besides Hiro in North Scottsdale, who serves live scallops. At Hiro, you will pay an arm and a leg, at Kampai, they will be fresher and you will pay fair market price, as set by AJ. The yellowtail and salmon sushi are always cured perfectly, not salty and melt in your mouth. There are both entree specials and sushi specials listed on the white boards above and next to the sushi bar. AJ makes the best salmon and yellowtail collars in the business, while serving better versions of the standard sushi bar appetizer fare, IE. Fried oysters, tempura, etc.. I will end this review here, but rest assured, if you are looking for the best, most authentic sushi dinner in the valley, Kampai is the place.THE END OF AN ERAWhat once was the best sushi restaurant in Phoenix is now under new management, and it definitely shows.They have tried to bring in new rolls similar to those at every other sushi place. They have changed the ingredients in many of their rolls, including the spicy tuna roll and the shrimp tempura rolls, which were the ones that kept us coming back. Kampai was special because it wasn't like every other Scottsdale sushi place, it had the freshest ingredients and the most authentic rolls. Not anymore.The quality of the ingredients is now very poor compared to what it used to be. The fish is sliced much too thinly. The rolls were not as fresh or as tasty even in the slightest. Their spicy tuna roll, which used to have fresh tuna and cucumbers and sprouts, is now made with a mixture of chopped tuna and spices with Krab mix. They changed their entire staff, which will come back to bite them sooner or later. The new sushi chef was rude, did not want to engage in conversation, and plainly did not acknowledge us. Our order was taken much later than we were ready to give it, and we had to ask for waters. Then, another chef came into the sushi bar area from the back wearing a plain tshirt, not a uniform, and without washing his hands he began to make our food. There were several questionable instances when cleanliness did not seem to be a concern of the sushi chefs. Sanitation is major at a sushi restaurant, and so is the food. So is the service. So is the music (which they changed from nice traditional music to soft rock?!). Since all of these things have changed, my family who has been long-time customers of Kampai for the last 15 years will sadly not be returning. Kampai, you just lost some previously dedicated customers. At least we went here in May for my birthday before they changed, I wish we knew it would be the last time that we could enjoy our favorites. I don't see how they will stay open for much longer.The Fall From Sushi Grace!! Kampai used to be my favorite sushi restraunt, there fish was very high quality and purchased fresh everyday. Now Kampai is simply meteocre, the new owners have completely changed the menu, sushi chefs, and the quality of fish has gone down drastically. Honestly I would not go back to Kampai now based on price alone, they are just to expensive for the low quality food that is served now. Less is definitely more as far as the old Kampai goes, their menu was simple and so were the ingrediants in the rolls. If you do choose to try out the downgraded Kampai I suggest the spicy tuna roll and the vegas roll, both are decent tasting. This sushi restraunt has nothing special to offer its consumers anymore. If you have been loyal to Kampai you will see how badly a mistake the original owners made when they decided to sell. Also Kampai is now open all the time so you can eat their crappy food almost anytime of the day now.
Pho 68=09/08/10I've eaten here a few times over the years.  Mom and I don't really care for the summer rolls (fresh, not fried, rolls of shrimp, pork, lettuce, rice noodles, and sprouts).  The peanut sauce that accompanies the rolls is good, however.  The bowls of pho and a few stir-fried meat over rice dishes we've had here were good.  The last three visits, however, were mainly for the ever-so-tasty durian shakes!  If you've never had durian, well, you're in for a ride of sensory overload!  Durian's scent for the uninitiated will most-likely be UNPLEASANT.  So overpowering is the durian's scent that many Asian countries ban its transport in public trains, planes, and automobiles.  Some hotels also will not allow patrons to store durian in their rooms!  Oh, but don't let its pungent smell deter you from trying it in shake-form!I suggest you ask for a second plastic glass and share this w/ a friend... Trust me-- it's too rich a drink to finish all by yourself!Dear Owner, why did you stop at 68? I suggest you adding one more number.  As we all know, the pho business is quite competitive, especially in this Asian mecca of town.  Survive on cheesy and perverted marketing, I say! ;-)Please redeem yourself, it's just embarrassing! Restore honor in the name of the Pho# community, which extends all the way to SoCal.  It was this 2-star recipe that I observed:1) Adding a dash of Black Pepper before my pho bowl arrives. Who does that? Trust me, nobody in my pho eating career have I seen this.  You either: a) believed your broth lacked flavors b) thought it was cool and tried to be different? If needed, we can use the shakers that was already sitting on the table. Clearly, a Pho Faux Pas.It threw everything off.  Slurp after slurp was quite painful.  The identity of the broth was more evident once I added the hoisin and siracha: bland-ish.  Hence the BP? *face palm*2) Empty Tables and Chairs.  Clearly, this was a dead giveaway but I was semi hopeful that the Pho Gods would bring me good tasting fortunes on this great Sunday afternoon. *face palm*3) SERVICE was so SLOOOOW, I thought at several points TIME itself had STOPPED.  In comparison to some legendary Viet places I know, I get my cup of water the second I sit down or atleast within reasonable time.  10 minutes before taking order, 10 more minutes for beverage to arrive. *face palm*If you are truly a Pho place, it shouldn't take you more than 10 minutes to deliver a bowl of Pho.  In fact, the vegetables took just as long to come out.  The anti-freshness did not help either! You would think being directly linked to an Asian Grocery would help in that regard.  *face palm*No excuse for slowness when the place is half full.Another thing, please invest in better Rooster and Hoisin sauces, not your mysterious, generic bottle.  *face palm*All of this face palming has caused my face to go numb! The only way I would return is if a ONE was added to the restaurant number.  By then I would expect an enhancement in the food and possibly a scandalous atmosphere. ;-)Sorry, not worth the 7 bones and something cents.  For now on, I will decide whether to risk my appetite by Factor #2. Sigh. Heed. Epic Fail. The End.
Javino's=Technically speaking, this restaurant has everything a good restaurant in North Scottsdale should have: nice decor and ambiance, intriguing menu with lots to try, live music, and a good location.  After reading some stellar four and five star reviews on Yelp, we were pretty excited to try it out for dinner, however we found ourselves leaving sorely disappointed with both the food and the service.  Mistake #1:  Not a big crowd on a Friday night. Granted we did arrive a little later than the normal dinner crowd (8ish), but there were very few people eating here which was a little disconcerting.Mistake #2:  Had to wait over half an hour just to order, even though the place was empty.  Our waiter apparently decided to go on a smoke break (and we're not talking cigarettes here people) right when we sat down.  This left me no option but to go to the front and ask the girls why we weren't being served.  They apologized profusely and got our waiter out to our table in a few minutes. Mistake #3:  The food was not that great.  We ordered two small pizzas, two appetizers (baby back ribs and stuffed bell pepper) and pork tenderloin cooked to medium.  The pizza's both were cold and tasted like cardboard and the pork tenderloin was a little on the tough side, definitely not cooked medium.  The appetizers were okay, but for all the food that we got, we both left ready to snack when we got home since we didn't finish our less than spectacular meal.I will say that the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was pleasant, but those are about the only redeeming qualities I can find in this restaurant.  We will surely not go back to Javino's for the simple fact that there are an abundance of restaurants in Scottsdale alone that offer the whole package in the dining experience without compromising the service or the quality of food.  Nice try though.... 2.5/5.Met some colleagues for drinks here the other night.  We were having a good time, then all of a sudden at 8:45 pm our server comes over to tell us that it was last call.....what?!  Yep, last call because they close at 9 pm.......you gotta be kidding me?!  What is this?!Oh well, we paid and we left.Return Factor - 10%
24 Carrots Juice Bar & Cafe=Ring Ring...."Good Morning, 24 Carrots, This is Sasha... how can I help you?"Me: "What is your soup today?"Sasha: "Well, I haven't made it yet; what sounds good to you?"WHAT! A business owner actually asking her customers what THEY want??? Incredible! What is even more incredible is that Sasha put up with my continuing barrage of questions, emailed me the most updated menu, and allowed me to order through email since 11 of us at the office wanted to give 24 Carrots a try.Sasha did an amazing job of meeting our needs, and even labeled each of the to-go boxes and smoothies with our names! The greens and beans soup was OUT OF THIS WORLD, and I fell in LOVE with the "Triple Threat Acai" smoothie... so much so that I got it again the second day! I also got to try the black bean burger on a bed of greens and the masala burger. I really love that you get either baby carrots or corn chips with your sandwich!Everything is from local farmers markets and cooked to order. You can taste the quality in the food. I also really love that everything is pretty much vegan, and any cheese is added on after the fact.In addition to the black bean and masala burgers, the pita pizza's were also a really huge hit with my co-workers.A+++ all around!!In order to get a full scope of what Sasha has to offer, you need to pop in to 24 Carrots at least 3 or 4 times because there are so  many amazing things to try, you cannot get it all in a visit!Here are some of the major highlights: 1. Every day they make a homemade soup from scratch, and every single day it is amazing. The mashed potato, split pea, tomato basil, tortilla, and beans and greens are all DELICIOUS!2. The hummus is like out of this world good. It has an airy, fluffy quality to it and they will give you extra veggies instead of pita if you can't eat gluten.3. Sasha takes emailed orders,  updates her specials on the FaceBook page daily, and regularly interacts with her customers online. 4. The Food: Mediterranean Bean Salad, Chipotle Tofu Scrambler Tacos, Summer Fruit Crumbler, GF Pasta Salad, Veggie Marsala Burgers w/ Jalapeno Cilantro Pesto ... I could go on, and on, and on....I'm so stoked that she listens to her customers and is extending hours, adding new menu items (BLT!!!), and considering doing delivery! Whether you are vegetarian, vegan, laden with food allergies, or a regular Joe schmo.... there is something delicious waiting for you at 24C!If you want to go somewhere that you will be welcomed like family, remembered as a friend and valued as a customer then 24 Carrots should be your next stop.The Cafe is cozy and comfortable, I feel like I'm going over to a good friends house every time I stop by. You can sit and relax and share wonderful conversations, ideas and recipes with Sasha. If there is anything she can do for you she probably will, Sasha has the sweetest kindest spirit and it really reflects into her food. There couldn't be more love and passion put into her food if your grandmother made it. I've simply Loved everything I've ever ordered here. The menu has some solid choices but for me the magic lies in the daily specials. Everyday Sasha creates something new and exciting to tantalize your taste buds using fresh locally grown organic produce. You can follow 24 Carrots on twitter and facebook to hear what she's cooking up next.I'm pretty disappointed in myself for not reviewing 24 Carrots. Every time I've gone, I've had the best service! The employees already know my name, they make suggestions from the menu, and make sure you're happy.They like to experiment in the kitchen (as opposed to me, in the bedroom) and will bring out things they are working on. Beet Balls. Cake Balls. Yeah, they make a lot of balls. Score!The last time I went, I had the grilled cheese. To die for!!!!This is a vegetarian restaurant, with vegan options. You can get regular cheese if you want.I always get a blueberry smoothie. Large. Yummy & good for the kidney!Bring your laptop, as there is free wifi. There is no more perfect place to work. Believe me.I have never had an over-the-top and deliciously decadent breakfast that doesn't leave me feeling guilty, nauseated or sleepy afterwards.... until now.Victory was delivered in the form of carrot cake pancakes. They are, for lack of better terminology, the bee's knees. The butterfly's shins. The wasp's ankles. You get the idea. Two fluffy pancakes studded with thick carrot ribbons, spices, and a delicious dose of sweetness independent of the maple syrup and fresh fruit they were served with. These are better than carrot cake... and I don't consider too many things in this world better than carrot cake.On a very mildly unpleasant note, one cake was slightly undercooked in the middle. However, I have no fear of vegan pancake batter and proceeded to shove the entire thing in my mouth anyway. I washed that down with a "field of greens" juice (it tastes like it has the power to cure hundreds of ailments), and deemed myself full and satisfied.Then, I noticed a little sliver of pie sitting in the fridge. Just a sad, single sliver. I had to inquire.. it looked so lonesome. Turns out it was chocolate caramel turtle pie. Vegan, raw, gluten-free, chocolate caramel turtle pie with a nut crust, salted caramel sauce, pepitas and pecans on top. I don't need to explain what happened next, just know that it was beautiful. Worth every one of the 650 pennies I shelled out for it.It's been seven hours since I've eaten and I'm still not hungry. With the quality ingredients that 24 Carrots puts into all their dishes, it's no surprise that juice, two pancakes and half a slice of pie has sustained me until dinnertime. Oh, 24 Carrots, your wholesome goodness will surely lure me in again soon.
Kabuki Japanese Restaurant=Nowhere inspires my wrath more than Tempe Marketplace, except maybe a Super Walmart parking lot. But I think they're building one of those here, too. Add in a Babies 'R' Us and you'd hit the slit-my-wrists trifecta.Kabuki would probably get three stars from me if it weren't located in the midst of this fakey-fake "urban experience" mall bullshit. But it is, so it doesn't.Plus, they make their iced tea with tap water and it tastes like shit. But coworkers looooove lunching at Tempe Marketplace. It's close to the office, and it's easy to drive and park there (never mind that we could walk to Mill Ave.) So OK, fine. I'm game, unless it's Maria Maria.I've been here twice -- once for lunch and once for happy hour. Well, we tried to go for happy hour. It ends at 6:00. Fuck you, too, Kabuki. I work too late for that bullshit. Next time I'll just go to Ra, where I might get severely injured eardrums from the ear-splitting club music bullshit. But at least they have cheap HH prices 'til 7:00. And they're on my drunk bus route home.I guess they were okay for a CHAIN, in a MALL.  Service was quick and even gave us free endame, I know, that's not much but it's something.  Just had a few rolls all of which were fine.  3 of the 4 rolls were about the size as a coffee cup, way too big for a humans mouth.  So what's a person do with rolls that are too big?Do you: A) Push the entire roll in you pie-hole and hope no food falls out when you start chewing.B) Cut up the roll with a knife and fork.C) Use your chopsticks to pick apart the roll into small bite size portions.Have your answer ready before you visit this place.Yelpers prove to be right yet again with the average 3 stars on this one... I was craving sushi and had a hot date with my sister-in-law last night to do dinner and a movie... It just so happened that Eat Pray Love was playing at the Tempe Marketplace Harkins Theater, so we decided to meet at Kabuki before the movie.  I walked in first and asked how long the wait was for two... I as told 10 or 15 minutes.  Not so bad... so I decided to wait.  I walked outside and met up with my Alexa and we came back in about ten minutes later... As we did so, two other women came in and I saw that they were seated right away.  I looked at Alexa, looked up at the hostess stand, was thinking (WTF), and then went and asked nicely where we were on the list.  "There are two tables before you," I was told.  "It will likely be another ten minutes or so." At that, I responded, "is there another option, perhaps sushi bar, that I don't know about?"And alas, there sure was... (they neglected to give me that option when I originally checked-in).  We were seated at the sushi bar at that moment and went on to have a very underwhelming meal.  Here's why:-While the large portion cucumber salads we ordered were extremely tasty, the cucumbers were cut lengthwise in such a way that it was difficult to eat.  I prefer cucumbers diced in smaller pieces so they are easier to eat!-Service - our waiter wasn't the friendliest... I felt kind of rushed by him when we were there.  Additionally, since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar, all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables, which was very distracting while we were eating!  Perhaps they could've moved the sushi ready for pick-up to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future?-The sushi itself was good; not amazing.  We had a Sunset roll, a Lotus roll, a Large roll, and an order of Ikura.  I didn't realize the Lotus roll was going to have a ton of mayo along with the baked Lobster that came on top of it... it was a bit on the creamy side for my liking.-To top things off, when the bill came, they overcharged us... a simple mistake, but given our experience, it was just one more negative thing... and then when I pointed it out, I barely got an apology at all.With so many other restaurants to choose from in the Tempe Marketplace, I am not sure I'll return to Kabuki.  If I do, however, I will wait for a regular table!It was a Friday night, my plans had changed and some friends told me to meet up with them for some Sake and Sushi, who can say no to that? So off I went!Ordered a few rolls for friend I to share, we went with the Vegas Roll, Lotus on Fire Roll and Sunkissed Roll.The Vegas roll was cream cheese, salmon, krab and avocado deep fired, it was good, just not my favorite, it's a textured thing I guess, not really into fired sushi, but my friend loved it.The Sunkissed roll was spicy tuna roll with salmon & sliced avocados on top of it, this was a great tasting roll.My favorite was the Lotus on fire, a California roll with spicy tuna & jalapenos & lotus root on top, delish! The perfect amount of heat too! Everything was fresh, and service was great too, and since Kabuki is practically in my back yard I am sure I will be back soon!Sadly  this isn' t as good the second time as the first time. The first time I was here the food seemed fresh and light and I really enjoyed a Volcano Sushi/ Tartare  dish .. mmmm  but this time ..what happened   ?The service was okay although for as empty as the place was , it seemed a  bit slow for refills and checking in. Akward sushi service , we were sitting at the bar and suddenly get  all our sushi at once on all different plates  ahhh  where do we put them , and no one has cleared our appetizer plates??? The rolls were big but sadly unmemorable.... something fried , something spicy tuna ish ,,blah blahdy  blah...  you get the picture. The good ole boys sitting next us were kind of fun to watch. They were singing country songs, while watching football , cramming too big of pieces of sushi in their mouths..It's not good when the slanted bathrooms are the most memorable part of your restaurant.  Doubt I 'll be back.Am glad my hubby liked his sushi, as I had one of the WORST restaurant experiences ever here.Our waitress was not exactly a firecracker, spoke very softly in a room full of loud bikers, and didn't seem in any hurry to help us.I am not a fish fan, but dearly love shellfish, so the grilled shrimp risotto sounded quite nice. Hubby's sushi arrived and he started in on it and was making nummy noises! When my plate of shrimp and risotto was tossed (literally) in front of me, I was expecting to be doing the same. Put a shrimp in my mouth and it was stone cold in the middle. Thought maybe this was a fluke, so went for #2. Not only was it even colder, but it had a funny taste and a fairly dry, rubbery texture.When the waitress returned, I asked if the shrimp was meant to be cold. She said no, and asked if I wanted her to get me another dish. I asked if the shrimp would be hot this time. She said yes, and took my dish. A few minutes later she returned with my original dish, risotto re-piled in the middle, with fresh greens and the remaining 5 shrimp from my first order. Shrimp were now warm, but VERY dry, rubbery and had a funny taste to them. When she returned again, I told her that the shrimp tasted funny and hubby showed her how dry they were. He asked if the shrimp had been frozen and she said yes. She returned a few minutes later to tell me that I was eating my meal incorrectly. Apparently, after 50 years, I am unable to dine in a restaurant without instruction! I was told that the shrimp were intentionally bland, because I was supposed to cut them up and stir them in with the flavorful risotto and sprouts. I advised her that the shrimp wasn't bland, it tasted funny, rubbery and dry. No response. No offer to get a different meal for me. Nothing. No adjustment was made to our check and my strongly worded letter to Kabuki will be for a full refund, no gift card, as I wouldn't be caught DEAD there again..Went here about 1pm on Sunday not very crowded and seated immediately. Menus and drinks followed. Service remained good throughout our visit. That's where the good stopped. The food?....well, let me just say this; "Don't waste your money!" Quality and quantity suffers greatly here. Nothing remotely Japanese at Kabuki only the name! Still hungry when we left and $35 lighter. No drink order either. The cooks here need to go to Japan to see how Japanese food is really crafted! I dislike having that feeling I just got ripped off. Dam!!!It's Monday night, I just got off work, I was kidnapped, and I was forced to join the little lady for Reverse Happy Hour at Kabuki.  You know it's a terrible Monday when I'm okay with being dragged to a chain sushi restaurant and I don't make a single snarky remark about how their menu is littered riddled with the usage of Papyrus.  I mean, Papyrus!  Who the heck designed their menus?  Must be someone from Collins College [This sentence is for Linh L.].Although I shiver at the thought of dining at chain sushi restaurants [I think my hatred stems with RA], I actually had a decent time at this Kabuki [Tempe Marketplace's Kabuki = no].  Our waiter was prompt and attentive, only disappearing for short-bursts of time when our food was in front of us.  We shared a small seaweed salad, a Vegas roll, an Alaska roll, a Shrimp Tempura roll, and we each had a Tokyo Mojito.  Our bill came out to be $40-something which isn't bad considering we were both full off our rolls and that deliciously refreshing mojito.  We probably could've done without one of the rolls but our eyes were hungrier than our stomachs.  Happy Hour, huzzah!The highlight of the night was watching some lady two tables away from us take her first bite of raw fish for the first time ever.  She promptly spit it up into her glass of water.  All that soy sauce and wasabi transformed her glass of water into L.A. Water.  I could go for another cocktail!I'll be back only for Happy Hour and a mojito.Perhaps it was the seriousness of the night and the topic the little lady presented me but I didn't have as an enjoyable time as I did last week.  No details, just quick notes mainly for myself:- Skip the Sauteed Mushrooms.  It's literally just white onions and mushrooms being sauteed in sesame oil and sesame seeds.  I could do this at home!- The Poke Tuna portion is ridiculously small.- No oysters until October.  Upon questioning why this is, no answer was given.  Boo.- Spider Roll:  Falls apart but not bad.  It's kinda of like trying to pick up tapioca with your chopsticks.  - Dragon Roll:  Too much unagi sauce, slightly small.- 10:15PM is when they turn on the lights and try to blind you out.  On the way out, you can watch the waiter counting their tips gleefully.  This made me laugh.- The mango Chu-Hi is really tasty though... even better than the Tokyo Mojito.  Cheers.$60 bill and only the cocktail was enjoyable.
P.F. Chang's=Brand spankin' new chain food! This place is a tad different than the other ones around you wont find the giant horses out front here and its a very open layout inside with giant light fixtures that look like drums hanging from above. Its a good thing we don't have to worry about earthquakes here folks! The hostess was totally pleasant I wish I were young and enjoyed my job as much. Our waiter was excellent he knew his shit. My sister and I started off with their white pear Mojitos they could have been stronger but they weren't overly sweet and quite refreshing. We didn't have to replace the drink with water during the meal so we just kept the Mojitos flowing. We started w the seared ahi tuna I didn't care for the peanutty wasabi sauce that came on it next time I'd get it on the side it definitely had a kick to it. I had the Buddha's Feast, fried it was nothing special I probably wont order that again I could easily make that at home, the Shanghai Cucumbers were good like always. My sister had the orange peel chicken and was told by the waiter to eat the peels w the chicken she loved it and we both had leftovers to bring home at the end.They had $2 desert cups we had the strawberry shortcake and banana split both were very rich and tasty. We left very full and happy for our Sunday treat.
Buffalo Wild Wings=Free wireless and their sports bar are what lured us to this 24-hour neighborhood joint in Centennial Hills.  Great place to watch games.....and the only place nearby where I could watch NHL playoffs.  With 18 screens around the bar, and 22 monitors in the dining room area, I had the pleasure of watching some NBA and UFC as well.  They even have two more monitors in the mens bathroom (over the urinals), so I never would miss a goal or powerplay.  Not sure if there were screens inside the women's, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did!After a few visits, I've become a fan of their bar food as well.  With 14 "smilin to screamin" different sauces, we've only had four so far.   Their boneless wings were satisfying with their medium sauce.  But their honey BBQ sauce made their ribs and wings combo better than average.  Our last visit involved their mango habanero sauce on their tender, juicy ribs and perfectly cooked wings.  This screamin sauce (third from their hottest) had a nice flavor and kick to it.  Their hot BBQ sauce went well with the pulled pork slammers.  The pork was a little dry but full of flavor.For desserts, we've had the chocolate cake and cinnamon bites, which I highly recommend after the spices.  Both were served with ice cream, and were very refreshing.   This place is as good as it gets with excellent service, great atmosphere, and phenomenal food!I enjoy coming here for the FREE WiFi, food, & beer.  This particular location is the closest BWW to my house, so I frequent it the most.Today I went for the Sampler.....Nachos, Cheese Sticks, Boneless Wings, and Onion Rings....yeah baby!  I thought the sampler was excellent, except the Nachos which were just OK in my book.  I'm not a huge fan of their Cheese/Chili combo on the Nachos.Washed it down with an Apricot Wheat beer....went for the Ranger IPA next and then the other IPA they have on tap to end the day.The place isn't too busy in the middle of the day, so it was nice to have most of the bar area to myself.  The server was awesome and very helpful.Will I return?  Of course...I will be here often.I am convinced this BWW location on Durango, north of the 215 is the only west side BWW that offers good service.  Too many bad experiences, as noted in my reviews, about the other two west side locations.  And this is my 2nd review of this location that was a fantastic dinner experience tonight.Hostess sat us within 5 minutes of arrival at a nice booth with a fantastic server.Sarah was our server and she was personable, made great recommendations, the order was accurate and never had to ask for refills as she was always right there when the glass was half full. She definitely earned 20% tip!We ordered the potato wedges basket which was much larger, and a decent size, than a basket of french fries as ordered last time here.We ordered two large orders of wings, abut 20 wings per large order, total 40 wings. Sauces we enjoyed were Spicy Garlic, Parmesan Garlic, Asian Zing, Medium, Honey BBQ and Jammin Jalapeno.Plenty of different sports on the TVs and the restaurant was clean, including the restrooms.I bumped by previous 3 star rating to a 4 star rating.  Seems this restaurant is consistent with tasty food, cleanliness and good service. Look forward to patronizing this location again in the near future.I don't know what it is about this location, but it's not as good as the others.  I come here because a friend of mine comes here regularly, but I wouldn't come to this BWW otherwise.My last visit was this past Thursday evening.  I was waiting for my friend in the bar and wanted to order a Ranger IPA.  I was told they didn't carry IPA on tap or bottled.....WTH?  The other location on North Durango & 215 has two IPA's on tap.....I was there 2 weeks ago, so I know they carry it.  I asked the waiter if they recently stopped selling IPA's and he said he didn't know and didn't even know what an IPA beer was!  I settled on a 24 oz Newcastle and put away 4 or 5 before the night was over.Wow, I thought that BWW's were suppose to be consistent with their product.  I guess I was wrong.....whatever.Will I come back?  Only when I come to visit my friend, otherwise I wouldn't come to this location.  There are better BWW's in Vegas.Went to this Durango/Warm Springs BWW location tonight around 9pm. It was NOT packed and there were several tables vacant at this late dinner hour.Here's what we experienced in 7 to 8 minutes time frame...The hostess seated us in a booth directly in front of the kitchen entrance. In other words, impossible for servers to not pass our booth as it is less than 10 feet from enter/exit the only kitchen access. We looked at the menus, made our dinner decisions and put the menus down as a universal silent hint to servers that we are ready to order. We looked around the restaurant that was NOT that busy....We watched servers come & go from the kitchen walking inches from our booth, watched servers bus two tables away from us- but did not even make eye contact, let alone greet us, nor ask what we would like to drink/eat. After 7 long minutes without contact from any BWW employee, we got up and left.On the way out, I stopped at the hostess stand at the front entrance and expressed dissatisfaction regarding the unfortunate poor customer service. The manager on duty, wearing a red shirt, by the name of Geoffry looked up at me while I was speaking to the hostess and two other young ladies next to him, and asked if we were in booth 121. I asked what his employee position is and he identified himself as the restaurant manager.I said I didn't know the booth # we were seated at, however I described the booth as directly located in front of the kitchen entrance and mentioned to him that we were passed at least 2 dozen times by servers, but not one stopped to say hello, take our order, identify themself as our server, etc.Without even acknowledging my complaint, let alone apologizing for his staffs poor customer service; the manager walked away into the restaurant. The hostess watched him walk away from the apparently difficult situation and then said to me "I am really sorry for his lack of leadership." Clearly, Geoffrey is the reason why the servers get away with poor customer service.I was looking forward to eating some wings, checking out a few games, tipping 20% and offering a 5 star Yelp rating tonight, but how many stars are listed above?TIP TO BWW: Get rid of Geoffrey and offer better customer service to patrons!Oh gawd whenever I think about BWW's I cringe at the awful customer service I'm about to receive at the bar, no matter the location (9 times out of 10, service is awful). I also have to brace myself for freezing cold temperatures inside. Bring a jacket if you're always cold like me! For this particular visit, me and my husband met another couple at the bar. They were holding seats for us so we were able to right walk up and sit at the bar.I have never eaten a wing in my life, or at least not that I can remember. I've been a vegetarian for over 11 years and I don't plan on eating any wings in the future either! With that being said, dining at BWW's is a happy medium for me and my dude. Why? Because they have a token black bean burger for me, along with lots of other vegetarian options like flat breads, quesadillas, and your usual neutral appetizers while he gets his wings. Both parties are content! SCREAMIN' NACHO BURGER ($9.95?): I always order this with the black bean burger when I come to Buffalo Wild Wings. They used to have a black bean wrap but it's no longer on the menu. Fries are hit and miss. They're usually stingy with the fries. 3.5/5 SERVICE: Our waiter virtually ignored us. It was difficult to get his attention to order food and ask for refills even though he was standing directly in front of us at the bar. The other couple wanted to order a dessert but gave up because service was so slow. VIBE: There was a sports game on but I wasn't paying attention. It was loud inside and pretty busy. Worth a Return Visit?Probably not at this location since it's so far away from where we live. There are 3 other BWW's in much closer proximity, so it doesn't make sense to make the trek out here. Also, this location doesn't stand out at all. I'd rather get crappy service close to home.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #139
Glass Nickel Pizza=I am pretty open-minded about pizza. I prefer it with a pretty thick crust and no meat but will try it no matter what is on it. This weekend I was without a vehicle (but with my three kids) and not in the mood to make any more PBJs. I wanted somebody to bring me some food, but I was also not in the mood for pizza. I settled on Glass Nickel because their pizza is good and I'd get some nice pasta out of it (the salads sounded good, too, but I wanted some warm food). I was able to do my order online, which I LOVE (two reasons: I am antisocial, and there should be less chance of getting it wrong since I wasn't relying on somebody to listen closely and write down what I said). I was able to put the tip on my credit card, another good thing. One thing I wasn't aware of was the email updates. I got an email once the order was finalized and sent, then another one when it was being prepared and then a third when it was out for delivery. It was a cold Saturday night, but delivery was pretty darn fast. The delivery driver was your stereotypical friendly stoner, and he had his own pen! (I used to order delivery more often, and I was always surprised at how often the driver didn't have anything to write with). The kids enjoyed their pepperoni pizza and I loved my pasta (fettucine noodles with pesto sauce, broccoli, and mushrooms. The broccoli was pretty well shredded, but it tasted very good).
Morels French Steakhouse & Bistro=C'est magnifique!  C'est merveilleux! C'est ci bon!Well, not quite.Located at the Palazzo hotel http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=q_XliEMMc_vle_IYjdF3kQ, Morels is a nicely designed space, done in dark understated yet rich tones, accented by Murano chandeliers and Tom Cannon's enormous, in your face art, all of naked female form.  As an aside, Tom Cannon must be a real lover of breast implants.  Not one boob in his paintings looked natural.  I couldn't decide if it was art or more of a cartoon-type work, but as the idiom goes, "The boob is in the eye of the beholder".http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=hiLDnJAUR6o9vAEH_8BmVQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=aLI33JvcXjoe6vI-xbVvXQIt has a beautiful wine bar and a spacious comfortable terrace (which they call a patio).http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=2hBacW9b6INPycSDqY11GAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=aiZj8CkK1NSFhI7ujjQZ5whttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=YQlwdGgpkhjKjtErmQjuLgHere's a virtual tour:http://delivery.vrxstudios.com/50372/virtualtours.htm?id=386407&id_type=2&locale=1&container=1We were a group of 7.  Our table wasn't ready so we were offered to have drinks on the terrace.  As beautiful and comfortable as it is, if you don't care for the Las Vegas heat, you don't want to be there.  Maybe in February.  Some of us opted for the terrace, as for the rest of us - there was not really any other available place to wait.Once seated, we found our server Rick to be friendly and efficient.   I still don't like it when a waiter announces his name, especially in an upscale restaurant.  I've never heard anyone call "Hey Rick" at XIV.  Depending on people's age and preference, it's always either "Excuse me", "Waiter", or "Excuse me, Sir".  Why do I need his name?  I'm not planning on exchanging Christmas cards with Rick...  I ordered Onion Soupe Gratinee and 18 Hour Red Wine Braised Short Rib, which was a mouthful, even before I got any food.  My date shared a Petite Romaine Heart Salad, served tableside, for two or more, with a friend.  For the main course, he ordered Grilled Halibut.  Almost everyone else ordered Kansas City Steak and Choice Filet Mignon.  We already had cocktails, so we shared 2 bottles of Red, don't remember which, but I do remember that Rick said that decent wine starts at $75.00 a bottle at Morels...My soup was delicious, rich, full of onion and cheese flavors, and a good size.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=_k3UURyS2x98gCP0gEkl8gAs to Petite Romaine Heart Salad, I was told that it was good, but that Petite applied to the size of the salad instead of that of the romaine hearts...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=pUHu4Va2XWQiWft7sxzuDwThen came my favorite part of the evening.  Our entrees arrived.  It was like a beautifully orchestrated symphony.  Seven waiters plus waiters' assistants all descended on our table at exactly the same time.  Things were moved, knives were placed, glasses were repositioned, and all our seven entrees magically landed in front of usat the exact same moment.  Talk about food orgasm, this was service orgasm!My short rib was excellent, you could really appreciate the tastes embedded in it in 18 hours.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=GOnQcXc3tlm9SpNKq9fRqQMy date's halibut was OK, I was told, but it looked really tiny.  All side dishes are extra, by the way, so if you want a side of steamed asparagus, for example, that alone will knock you $14.00.  If you want a different sauce - that's extra too. Now to the steaks.  Of the 5 people who ordered them, 2 or 3 complained that the cut wasn't what it was supposed to be, that the beef was too chewy, and one complained of an overcooked steak.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=CIYQHfa3dExTAv4OMLw-ngTo make us feel better, we were comped two desserts for the entire table of 7 (a little stingy, considering, if you ask me).So, based on my food alone, it would have been 4 stars, but given the bad steaks in a steakhouse, and prices that I thought were too high, the most I can give is 3.  Knowing that I will be writing a review, I, very not ladylike, craned my neck to see what my date was paying.  Two entrees, two appetizers, and about half a bottle of wine (maybe a diet coke too) - around $200.00.Ouch.If you happen to go there on a cool evening, sit on the terrace, you'll have an amazing view of the Strip AND you can see the Sirens of Treasure Island show that's across the street and runs a couple of times a night.We came here last night because we needed to eat at 4:00 pm and wanted a great steak by the Palazzo Hotel.  Most of the high end steak houses do not serve till 5:00 pm.We walked around the hotel and bumped into this gorgeous restaurant that was OPEN!We went in, sat down on a fab table with a view of the strip and orderedescargot, french onion soup, lobster bisque, rib eye steak, filet mignon, rack of lamb, mushrooms, brocolli, scalloped potatos, and truffled mac and cheese.Each item that we tried was just outfuckingstanding!!!!!!!!French Onion soup, lobster bisque and escargot were soooo flavorful, I could of eaten those starters alone and left satisfied.The meats were cooked to perfection and soooooooo tender and juicy.The sides of mushrooms, potatos, mac and cheese, and brocolli with a  tangy hollandaise sauce complemented the meats like white on rice......The service was super-excellent...........!!!!!!!Toss in the incredible ambience and beautifully designed and furnished dining room and you have one of the finest restaurants that I have ever eaten at.Brunch here was one of the most amazing meals of my life! It was SO incredible! Our waiter was the sweetest guy and I loved starting the meal with a bloody mary prepared for me table side :) The waiter used all of the perfect ingredients and even muddled the garlic in the bottom of the glass! I ended up adding a little bit of A1 to make this the best bloody mary ever. For food, the waiter gave great suggestions. The croque monsieur was insanely delicious and came with perfect french fries. The waiter brought out their homemade mayonnaise with truffles for french-fry dipping and it was perfect too. The crab eggs benedict was also insane. I usually don't like hollandaise sauce but this hollandaise was delicious. The crab meat was so succulent and perfect.Then, there was the special mac and cheese with blue cheese, truffles, and more. It was so rich and perfect! The restaurant is super classy and the sexy paintings on the wall are pretty cool too.I cannot wait to come back here and expect to visit during every future Vegas trip (which I expect will be a lot of trips! ;) )Thank you Morels for being UNBELIEVABLE!!!Never say never, apparently.  I'll put this back on a list of places I'll go again and a place that you should go.  Under new general management!!!4ish stars for food/atmosphere/etc.5 stars for serviceFull disclosure: this was the "let us make it up to you meal."  Constantin, the new general manager, saw my review on Yelp and contacted me to apologize for my terrible experience (the first true apology I received, mind you) and wanted us to come back so he could make it up to us and show us how Morels has changed.  He seemed very earnest and I'm fairly open minded, so off to Morels we were!Constantin came right over after we were seated to say hello and thank us for trying them out again.  He briefly explained the menu he had planned for us and introduced Matt, our server.  Honestly, Matt seemed a bit nervous at first; I think he was concerned that we were super snotty or something, but after we chatted him up, he calmed down quite a bit and opened up a lot.  He was a good server and a cool guy! On to the food:Amuse Bouche: Fresh Crab Salad on a homemade truffle potato chip.  Crab was excellent and the mixes of textures and salty/savory was great!Oysters: Yummy Kumamotos; super good, as would be expected.(There are wine/champagne pairings in here, but I dont recall what they were; they matched wonderfully though!)Appetizer: Chef's Prime Beef Tenderloin Tartar: omg so good!  The quail egg and truffle chips were an excellent complement to the quality beef. I normally wouldn't order beef tartar, but I would order this again!Iron Cast Roasted Branzino: I was very impressed with this dish.  I'm not a huge cooked fish person, but I recently tried the branzino at Angelini Osteria in Los Angeles.  Angelini is a favorite of mine but I only tried the fish because Wolfgang Puck praised it on Best Thing I Ever Ate.  It was alright.  The branzino here at Morels was so good; cooked perfectly, nicely moist, and served with a nice beurre blanc.  Petite Cut Filet: Pretty good.  I enjoyed the quality of the meat and the preparation.  There is an interesting cumin-based rub they use that might scare off some diners; I liked it but it did overpower some bites for sure.Our favorite cheesemonger, Jake (who is now a server) came by to see if we had any preferences and proceeded to hook us up with some amazing cheese.  Matt then had the gall to bring us dessert!!! I can't recall the name but it had some fresh fruit and a meringue mixture.  I'm not doing it justice, but it was a nice bite or so. I was far too full!Before he left for the night, Constantin came to check on us one more time.  He was the consummate gentleman and totally made up for our previous experience.  While I 100% stand by my previous review, I'm sorry that we experienced Morels at such a down point (with the previous manager) and thought so poorly of the restaurant for so long.  Thanks Matt for being a great server! And, thank you to Constantin for having faith in us as customers to know good service and food when we see it.  We're very excited to go back!Very friendly service but that's about it.  They clearly have no idea what they are doing...from the servers, to the bartenders, to the chefs....it was a debacle from start to finish.  How does prime real estate at one of the nicest casinos in vegas survive such utter incompetence.  They screwed up pretty much everything we ordered..mojitos without muddled mint, overcooked mussels, a souffle left in the oven about 20 min too long, the bussers couldn't figure out how to light the fondue.  Total nincompoopery from start to finish.   The only thing keeping them from receiving a single star is they were so nice.  But nice only gets you so far.We enjoyed a relatively late new year's eve dinner (10:00pm).  The top reasons I made reservations for Morels a couple of weeks before were:1. Proximity to the strip.  It's right by the Palazzo entrance.  Easy for us to run out and see the fireworks in 30 seconds.   2.  They were serving the a la carte menu unlike a lot of other restaurants that night doing some $250+ per person prix fixe bs.  I'd rather just do the full meal deal at Joel Robuchon instead paying that kind of money for overpriced NYE menus at Comme Ca, Koi or holy crap god forbid Sugar Factory.  3.  STEAKOur starters were the "Onion Soup Gratinee" and the "Pan Seared French Rougie Foie Gras".  The soup was a 3 out of 5.  We prefer our onion soups a little more robust and wine flavored where this was kind of sweet.  It was a hearty portion as it should be for $10 but not worth ordering again.  The foie gras on the other hand was deeeeeelicious.  It was accompanied by caramelized red onion, candied apples and balsamic reduction.  There's just something about the fatty and unique flavor of the duck liver with fruit that I can't get enough of.  Restaurants in Vegas like Andre's and Gordon Ramsay Steak do it really well and this was right up there.  For the entree, we chose not to mess around and just went with the 32 oz porterhouse for two prepared rare.  They served it tableside and it came with roasted rosemary potatoes, fricassee of baby turnips, sauce Bordelaise, onions & carrots.  We asked to keep the bone as always either in hopes of being ambitious a few days later and using it to make beef noodle soup at home or just gnawing at the bone while walking down the street like a couple of insane canines later in the evening.The steak was very good.  32 oz is a monster cut and we were only able to finish half and box the rest.  I actually preferred the sirloin side over the filet this time around which was kind of surprising for me.All in all a very solid choice for steak but still not close to the best steaks in their own building thanks to Mr. Batali and Mr. Puck.  I would come back here for happy hour and also when it's warmer to dine outdoors.Terrible. Food and service.I have been to just about every strip steak place and this is hands down my least favorite. And not just by a little bit, by a rather large margin.I love steak and I love French so this should have been a match made in heaven, perhaps how much I looked forward to going here tainted my view but it was so bad it can't all have been my bias. Just look at my review record- I have enver given 1 star to anything else- I am a pretty soft judgeFirst- my reception.I had just spent an inordinate amount of time playing poker at the Venetian. As such I was not dressed super formally- khaki shorts, polo shirt, tennis shoes- more than acceptable for vegas lunch. This is on a Weds about 230pm. The host ( a dude) ignores me for about 5 minutes while he is on the phone than finally, reluctantly, brings me to a table. It is then about 20 minutes before I see my waiter. During this wait I am drinking some water and happen to empty my glass. The water guy comes up and starts pouring the water before the pitcher is over the glass and misses the glass for a solid 3 seconds soaking the entire table and myself before he notices. I ask to move to a dry table. He tells me "maybe". At this point I look around, I am one of 6 people in the entire place. Eventually I get moved.My OrderI try to get the exact same thing my first time at every steak house here for comparison- bone in ribeye, potato side, tartare. The waiter comes up to my table and I try and get my order in as quickly as possible since I have already been waiting. me: "Tenderloin Tartare, Bone in ribeye medium rare, potato dauphinois"him: would you like to hear about our specialsme: nohim: well then what would you likeme: Tenderloin Tartare, Bone in ribeye medium rare, potato dauphinoishim: im not sure we have thatme: which parthim: uh... the potatoit only went downhill from there. He didn't write anything down, came back twice to ask to clarify, and then brought tuna tartare. The tuna was actually the highlight of the day.The SteakI like steam rare to medium rare. That being said, I will eat just about anything. The steak that was brought to me was not even grey, it was so dark grey throughout I doubted if it was actual meat. It looked like an overcooked mcdonalds hamburger inside. I first cut a piece off the end and decided to give them the benefit of the doubt- maybe it wasn't like that in the middle. It was. Now, a quick note about me. I don't really ever send food back. I'm a gambler and I think ordering food is sort of a gamble- in this case I gambled and lost. Also, if a kitchen has already screwed something up I don't have much faith in them fixing it so generally I just let it go.And that is what I planned to do here. So my waiter comes back and says "how is everything". The following conversation ensuesme: The steak is way overcooked, its inedible, can I get my checkhim: It looks fine to meOk, thats annoying. Still, never argue with stupid people right...me: just the check pleasehim: I'll bring that right out15 minutes later the waiter comes back with another waiterNew waiter- I'm sorry sir, we cannot send that back, it looks medium rare to me. At this point I am flabbergasted. Was I getting punked? Could I actually be eating in a professional restaurant? Let alone a nice one in Las Vegas? Could anyone working in a steakhouse for longer than 3's of minutes think this was medium rare?me: I'm not trying to send it back, I just want my checkAnother 10ish minutes go by and I get my check. I choose to pay by way of the credit card. I put it in the little wallet thing and stand it up so all can see the card sticking out of it. At this point I look at my watch and think to myself "how long could this take". Turns out quite a while. After another 10 minutes I look around and I can't see any other customers in the place. I take my check and walk to the front where the host and 3-4 waiters are sitting in the bar area. I ask my waiter to run my card which he sighs and then does. Also, they charged me for the tenderloin tartare which is 1 dollar more than the Tuna....I then walked outside across the street and ate at stripburger.In closing, Carne Vino greater than MorelsAmazing quiche!I want to take a moment to focus on the quiche Lorraine here......................AMAZINGIt's buttery, salty from the bacon, sweet from the caramelized onions, flaky and so damn great. No joke the best I've had in this city. I've also lived in Paris many years ago and I fondly remember gaining 20 pounds in just six months over quiche Lorraine there! The restaurant is beautiful with a bistro feel that has very sexy art all over the place and our waitress was kind enough to give me a few postcards with the artists info who is Tom Cannon. The art is perfect and they also have a beautiful outdoor space that overlooks Las Vegas Blvd. The food is really great here and did I mention they have quiche Lorraine? Ok let's get through this and the highlights without losing my focus. The tuna tartare was fresh and light. The cheese fondue was decadent and fun to dip & eat. The crab omelet my friends ordered was fluffy and delicious and my quiche was out of this world. I remember every bite...:)We also received complimentary dessert which was a pleasant surprise. Thank you for the delicious profiteroles with warm chocolate sauce! The service was on point and we came over on a weekday for a business lunch and luckily had the place to ourselves. This however worried me because this place should be popular. I have had dinner at this location before but we didn't have a fantastic experience due to waiting too long even with reservations but this lunch experience was perfect.After eyeing this place for some time, Diane selected Morels for her birthday dinner.  It was our first time here but will not be our last..We were initially presented with a salty Olive Tapenade, butter with Hawaiian Sea Salt, and delicious soft warm rolls.  Quickly following were Wild Caught Prawns that were cold and meaty, and a Horseradishy Cocktail Sauce.  My other preliminary course was a crock of excellent sweet Onion Soup Gratinee with a large and well-deconstructed crouton and well-melted Comte and Gruyere Cheeses.Both of us then enjoyed the night's featured Surf & Turf Special of Filet and Half-Lobster.  We each received a very nice lobster half and a nicely seasoned 8 oz. Filet with little char cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered.  The lobster meat was sweet dipped in either drawn butter or specially requested Buerre Blanc, and ran out just a few bites ahead of the Filet.  Excellent whipped Mashed Potatoes accompanied the combo entree.  Three flavored sea salts were also provided: Black Hawaiian Sea Salt, Smoked Black Sea Salt, and Red Hawaiian Sea Salt.We finished with very good Classic Profiteroles served with Candied Vanilla Almond Ice Cream and Malted Chocolate Sauce.  I just wish there had been more ice cream.Our booth back was hard but seating was otherwise comfortable, with a nice cushioned bottom.  Sensually appealing fine art adorned several walls.Service was excellent except for tea sweeteners initially being removed prematurely.  Chamomile Decaf Iced Tea was specially made for me, with needed refills quickly supplied without request.  The dining room was not that crowded on a Saturday night.                 In sum, we found Morels to be an upscale dining venue with a nice classy ambiance, fine food, and excellent service!Located off the lobby of The Palazzo and, as such, easily missed by those visiting the property who are not checking in, Morels could easily be seen as the "third option" steakhouse in a resort complex housing Carnevino as well as Delmonico, but a close look shows several differences, a leisurely breakfast or brunch on the outdoor patio providing a great opportunity to take them all in, particularly the city's greatest cheese selection.Part of a small group, another location found at The Grove in Beverley Hills, Morels spins French on the traditional "big meat" concept and going so far as to produce their own wines a glimpse at the interior speaks to the grand brasseries of Central Europe with large nudes hung on walls and an airy, spacious layout while an oyster bar sits up front to tempt those without time or interest for a table within.Sitting with two friends and a trio of children at a spacious table of three two-tops fit together overlooking the sunny 9:00am Strip below, it was admittedly as guests of the house that a sizable meal was taken, the feast essentially comprised of four courses with children's orders thankfully taken first as two-hours of restaurant rumors and banter proved a challenge for all but the 2-year old, the staff doing an admirable job of expediting plates...and an even better one of trying to clear space for what was decidedly too much food.Perhaps not going to the lengths of Batali or Lagasse in terms of meat sourcing or buying produce from the very best purveyors around, suffice it to say that those interested in coffee are well advised to elect service from French Presses featuring roasts from Equator, for although priced at $5-7 per person depending on the bean the quality offered from Thomas Keller's preferred brand are easily the best in Sheldon Adelson's complex, particularly with free refills arriving promptly as cup-after-cup was downed.Offering Mimosas and Bloody Marys mixed tableside it is with pillowy beignets that each brunch at Morels begins, and although granulated sugar would better be replaced with the powdered stuff of New Orleans the oilless donuts proved quite light, as did the leafy greens dressed in fruit and balsamic with a great kick added by Laura Chanel's ever creamy chevre.Attempting to sample a good variety of items, rather than just focus on obvious 'breakfast hits,' it was with four savories ranging from sandwiches to benedicts that meal marched on and although the picked crab crowned with a perfectly poached egg was unfortunately overwhelmed by a touch too much lemon while a steak requested 'medium' was tender and tasty despite being served nearly blue atop a bed of sauteed onions, both the chicken sandwich and risotto were exceedingly well executed - the former particularly intricate with the nuttiness of Comte playing nicely off peppery arugula bathed in buttery Mornay.Assuredly taking the opportunity to explore a recently updated carte du fromage, something Morels would be well advised to emphasize both at the tableside and in advertisements around the resort, it was with a great deal of effort that selections were limited to a mere ten options and weaving a wide swath of beasts, countries, and textures one would be hard pressed to make a single bad choice - the aged Canadian Cheddar particularly on-point while both the creamy Brie and Stilton-Sandwich Huntsman were equally well selected, palates rejuvenated between bites by candied walnuts and date paste made in house.Never one to skimp on sweets, though admittedly a bit disappointed that nearly half the desserts are unavailable at brunch (as is the cheese fondue,) it was still in pancakes, French toast, and a lovely rustic tart that the afternoon concluded, the Pacojet crafted quartet of ice creams exceedingly rich and creamy with the marshmallow studded lightness of lemon meringue the best amongst the crowd.***Neither trying nor succeeding in any way to steal the thunder of other Steakhouses within the Venetian/Palazzo complex, Morels is better appraised as an upper/mid-range option to be celebrated for its differences, the early opening hours offering a significant upgrade on Grand Lux in terms of service or setting while the fromage, coffee, and ice cream are Strip-side second to none.
Pete's Fish & Chips=Every once in a while Pete's can kind of hit the spot... but I'm not quite as crazy about it as some locals seems to be. The fish and chips are good and cheap; and their special sauce is pretty damn tasty... but I usually leave feeling a little fishy and greased out. The fish is perfectly square, and I can't help but wonder why they do it that way... because it really gives off a 'store bought' vibe. Compare this to somewhere like Fulton Fish Fry in Vegas which has fresh pieces of fish that each kind of form their own twisted and unique shape... it just feels more authentic that way. This just feel like a fish patty that could have been taken out of a McDonalds Filet-O-Fish and thrown in the greaser.So what I gotta say about Pete's is this: only go if you're craving some no-frills fish and chips; and if you have such a craving you'll probably leave happy... if however you are looking for something to make your taste buds shiver with excitement, then look elsewhere. Oh yeah... one last thing... their whole sense of entitlement really gets on my nerves sometimes. Having kooky rules at a restaurant is fun, but it only works if that restaurant is serving up magnificent food. Here you are getting average food and they try to make you feel like they are the Gods of Fish and you must bow down and obey their every command if you want to get served (like their whole "no ketchup-don't even ask" thing). You better be careful Pete's or you may find people are gonna find somewhere else with better food, that doesn't hassle you if you ask for ketchup. Meh.
Restaurant Miyako=This restaurant is in the Amherst street area, reminiscent of Hollywood in LA or the Castro in SF. It is a mixed neighborhood of small shops, restaurants, with several Asian and Gay establishments with a couple of seedier adult video stores on cross streets. The restaurant has been here for 20 years, first owned by a Japanese national, who sold it to a Vietnamese family. It has Japanese decor, with a small sushi bar with 2 chefs. All staff are Vietnamese. Mr. Ho is the head sushi chef, and he escaped from Vietnam on a boat in 1980. Turns out 95 percent of the Sushi establishments in Montreal are Vietnamese, Chinese, or Korean owned. This includes the nearby Yuki sushi (2 locations in the same area) which is Chinese owned and not as good. The sushi was pretty good. I had Nigiri Sushi, including Hamachi, Maguro, Saba, Sake and Uni, with a bowl of Miso Soup. All the Nigiri were moderately priced from $4 - $5, even the uni at only $5.75 CAD. The staff was friendly, especially after they found out I knew they were Vietanamese and we talked about Vietnam experiences. They speak French, English and Vietnamese. No Japanese, however!
Cork Restaurant=My first trip was for lunch. My waiter sold me on the Lunch Special (fried shrimp and crab cakes with pineapple salsa, (see pics)$ 15 But I Love quiche so I had to order that too (see pics) $10 Thank God I ordered both, these were smaller than appetizers, I was told that Lunch had full size portions? O well I guess~ at least it was really good.~ Although I did have a problem with the shrimp, it tasted like cleaner, they brought me a couple more crab-cakes instead. side note*= tables have no salt, pepper or sweeteners, I ordered an ice tea and still was not offered any sugar.Second trip Brunch= I had already made reservations for brunch prior to my first visit. So here we are again no salt and pepper or sweeteners, there was 3 of us and only two table setting up until right before our food came out. Ordered Ice tea and still had to ask for sweeteners. What we ordered: Ham and biscuits=Fresh Baked Biscuits, Virginia Ham, Poached Eggs, Champagne Hollandaise (see pics) $12The "ham" was not ham but extremely cheap and salty prosciutto, I put it aside, the rest was quite good although rather tiny. I informed the waiter , he comes back with the chefs apologies and some lame excuse saying "well its American prosciutto that's why we call it ham" WTH the menu says Virginia ham? Virginia Ham Monte Cristo=Edwards and Sons Ham, Sourdough French Toast, Swiss Cheese (see pics) $11. Very Good, probably the best thing between us all and it had the ham that it described. Sunny Side Up Eggs=Organic Eggs, Smoked Bacon, Hash Browns (see pics) $9This was not on the kids menu by the way and very sadly it was served with Denny's hash-browns, this is a fancier restaurant shouldn't those be taboo?? Buttermilk Pancakes=House-made Butter, Fig and Peach Syrup (see pics) $10They tasted good but that does not make up for the fact that they were served with NO BUTTER and COLD SYRUP and a little burnt as you can see!!!Let me sum it all up for you: Ham and biscuits................. $12Virginia Ham Monte Cristo.....$11Sunny Side Up Eggs............$9Buttermilk Pancakes...........$10 Having to go somewhere else for breakfast after brunch..........PRICELESS!!! I really have mixed feelings about this place, because the food is quite good but really overpriced for the portion size. I mean I do go to a restaurant to EAT for God's Sake!It might be cheaper to invest in a Lap Band Surgery than to try and go here and get full.I have to go with 2.5 starsI could have been happy with just the homemade cinnamon doughnuts, the cold Bellini's, and the table conversation but after looking at their special Easter brunch menu I knew there would be more to come. Cork had a variety of classics to choose from that were seasonally inspired and well thought out. I'm grateful to have friends and family who are willing to share because if it weren't for their generosity I would have had to order several dishes.There were plates of thick slices of pecan and raisin French toast with warm sautéed bananas and organic maple syrup passed around for everyone to try. Forks full of bourbon and honey glazed ham that, at least twice, made its way around the table. There were also spoons full of tangy and bright champagne hollandaise and perfectly poached eggs that everyone tried. One of the many great attributes that Cork has going for them is their passion for the customers. Hands down some of the best service I've had in the valley. Just to give you an idea how good they are- we were greeted by the chef, it's nice to know people who know people, the server was more excited about the menu than I was, and the owner thanked us for sharing Easter with them. We liked them so much that we made reservations in a private room for the end of the month. If I weren't so far away from them I would probably ask them for a personal napkin.Cork is an enigma.What makes it enigmatic is how damn good it is... Too good for Chandler and maybe too good for the valley.The portions are just right, and anybody that tells you otherwise is a fat ass or a glutton (I'm 6'3, 200lbs. and I was satisfied).  If you want large portions though, go to their lunch/brunches.  I've been there twice and had The Lamb Chop, which was amazing on all levels, and I've had some serious lamb in rural Bosnia, which has been labeled the best in their country... sure enough cork's stood up blow for blow.  The other entrée I experienced was the buttermilk fried chicken.  I was so amazed by the lamb the first time, that I had to try something more "simple" in order to qualify their food in regards to regular places.  Let's just say the chicken was not regular, it was outstanding.  The appetizers are crazy good... can anyone say king crab legs?The wine selection is top notch.  the booze selection is killin, and they even make this amazing Italian lemon stuff that's like 90% alcohol.  make sure you have a designated driver, because this place will inspire winos and boozers to indulge to their fullest.Go to Cork, because it's that damn good!10/29Met Violeta H. for happy hour.  Loved the atmosphere here!  Warm shades of amber and gold, and textures of cork, wood, and metal married beautifully.  It was only later, when presented w/ paybooks that looked and felt like cork, that I noticed that the floor tile was made to look like cork!  Cunning, this, I thought.  [In our excitement to finally try Cork for the first time, I'd neglected to tell V. that Andrea K. might try to join us later on (and later still, Andrea's friend Brynn!)].Violeta and I started our most enjoyable evening by ordering champagne.  Hers was flavored w/ Kir (cherry liqueur) and mine w/ St. Germain elderflower.  It was very good, and soon it was time to order another; Violeta ordered more of the Kir, and I, impressed that she found it so great to order it again, ordered one myself.  Unfortunately, I didn't find it as agreeable, so I asked if it could be replaced with a Bellini, instead.  No problem.  This version went down smoothly, albeit too smoothly (and way too fast!), as it was much sweeter than the elderflower.  For my third flute, I went back to my original choice (if only to make the drink last longer!).  Violeta and Andrea later tried the elderflower and liked it.For our "entree," I ordered the Prime Better Burger, cooked medium, while V. ordered the grilled cheese.  My burger was decadent: bottom layer consisted of 4 oz. prime burger w/ aged cheddar, and topped w/ 4 oz. shortrib, w/ garnishes of wild mushrooms, sun-dried tomato, and aioli.  Violeta's grilled cheese was equally wicked- slices of Granny Smith apples, bacon, and brie encased in toasted cranberry-walnut bread!  While I enjoyed my burger, I found it too indulgent; I'd definitely order the grilled cheese, in a heartbeat!I think I was in the middle of finishing my entree when Andrea joined us, and may have offered her a bite, which she may have liked so much, that she ordered a burger for herself.  Such a shame that her burger, ordered medium, came out more on the rare side... I was able to talk Andrea into trying the arancini with me after failing miserably w/ Violeta :o  I thank the heavens Andrea played along, because the arancini was freakin' amazing!  Andrea and Brynn would agree!  A clear highlight of the evening.  Tonight's flavor was Marconi almond pesto.  The menu stated that the flavors change daily.  Cannot wait to return and try a new version!For dessert, Violeta ordered a sorbet trio (which I thought was a bit on the safe side; I like rich desserts!), while I asked for banana creme pie.  Beautiful presentation!  What first struck me were the banana slices- these four pieces were given the torch treatment a la creme brulee.  Loved the amber color!  Then, the white and dark chocolate cigarettes propped onto the generous mound of toasted marshmallow!  Mmm... Every slice of the fork into the pie yielded a perfect ratio of mallow, banana cream, and graham cracker crust... Even the long, narrow river of chocolate sauce in the middle was just enough to add yet another level of exquisiteness to this dessert! If you like bananas, you owe it to yourself to visit soon and order this!  What an amazing meal shared with fantastic women!  Thank you V and our new friends Andrea and Brynn!  To top the evening off, owner Robert sent us a round of late harvest Gewurtztraminer!  Funny, I was the only one who finished a pour...12/18/09How I LOVE this place!  The grilled cheese gets me everytime!  I'll even get cheesy (pun intended!) and borrow a few words from a popular Cowboy Ciao quote- This dish is so good, it makes me want to get naked and roll in it!  The "orangini" that night (chicken and risotto rolled together, deep-fried, then set on an marcona almond pesto) was just-OK.  Nothing to write home about.  I think I'm done w/ arancini... maybe not.  I think it was the chicken that turned me off.  Still ate both pieces, though.  Oh, but the grilled cheese!  BTW, I met a couple of friends here, who, just like me, fell in love w/ the St. Germain elderflower champagne and red wine!  Thanks for another great afternoon, Cork!I first read about this place in the Phoenix New Times and I take my wife there on occasion. We like coming here for dessert, after eating somewhere else. Their take on banana cream pie is exquisite. But it seems with every time we give this eatery our patronage, the service gets worse and worse.Cork's version of banana cream pie is awesome. Elegant and tasty. But having a meal here is a different story, and after only trying the food one time, I won't ever do it again. The one time my wife and I ordered food from Cork, it was only out of curiosity and was following meal at another place; thus we only wanted something light before ordering the banana cream pie, so we each got an appetizer. I got the plate of meat, cheese, and crackers; and she got a salad. Both dishes were lean on the helpings, and though I've come to just expect it from Cork, I find the portions a bit annoying for what you pay. (I've seen what other patrons order as well, and see the cost on the menu. Geez.) Anyway, my appetizer was good for what it was, and the wife was satisfied with hers as far as taste went. But the turn-off was with the waiter through the entire time. First, he acted very irritated when we only ordered water and not wine, and was very condescending with us wanting only appetizers to precede our pie. ("Usually people order a MEAL with an appetizer." WTF?) The kicker was when he made snarky comments about me paying cash instead of using my card. What, dude? When I have $35 in my pocket, is the place really too ritzy to pay the check with cash? That was a new one.If my review were based solely on what our personal Cork staple is (the banana cream pie,) then it'd get 5 stars. But between the minimalist yet expensive portions and the up-nosed, elitist attitude of our waiter, I just can't give it even an average rating. From now on, we only come to Cork for dessert. Seems like the wait staff won't turn into divas when you do that.Peculiar.
Fantasy Grill=Look, I don't have a problem with the concept. Bring on the fun and sexy girls in lingerie. I'll eat crappy food, I'll put up with bad service, I probably won't even notice the dirty restaurant. But if that's your thing, if fun and sexy girls are your gimmick, you better make damn sure your girls are fun and sexy. Which the girls at Fantasy Grill are not. So what have you got when you remove fun and sexy girls from the equation? Crappy food, bad service and a dirty restaurant. F'in gross, man. Stay away.
Piccolo Forno=We get there. Reservations for six at 6. Half our party is there, half is on it's way. We tell them we're here. Can't sit until the whole parties there. I get that. But then the hostess adds "we have a party at 8 PM that's sitting at your table and you'll have to leave by then." I get that, sometimes you gotta hustle.We sit at 6:15 with our whole party. Our server comes up without even a GREETING and says, "we have another party sitting here at 8 PM, so you'll have to be done by then." I don't get that....That was just a little too much! I've never been anywhere that was so blatant about getting you outta there asap. I understand you've got to move people in and out, but don't tell us when we haven't even ordered a thing and are planning on spending money in your establishment! Even with taking our time we were done at 7:45 PM. Plenty of time to clean off the table for this important party. Too bad because the food was good. The service left a little to be desired...
Fine's Cellar=Well my Mr turned 40 today and what better way to show my love then to take him out for a nice dinner for 2. Well as you can see by my rating this went horribly wrong very fast.***** The space at Fines is modern comfort. Comfortable with long oversized banquets.. ball chain screen and cool stained concrete floors that looked like suede. We were sat off a 7pm reservation immediately. We both noticed that the patio was hopping.. great for a new local business. We ordered a couple of glasses of wine from the host and loved the selection from that menu as well as the food menu.**** We waited for some time until our glasses of wine were brought to our table. The person delivering was apparently our server. She never asked how we were.. told us her name.. just dropped the wine off and asked if we were ready to order. We placed our order and took in each other. The wine was very good and the space comfortable. Our apps came out in pretty decent time and we dug in. I had the calamari and the Mr had the BLT.. both were pretty good though mine should have had less salt. Otherwise the food paired with our wines quite well.***Waiting for our plates to be cleared we felt that maybe we weren't that important. The host guy was fawning over 2 tables with champagne service as well as sports scores for the table next to us. Service is a pretty big deal to me and can pretty much ruin an evening. Finally our plates were cleared and salads brought out some time after that. I had the Arancini and the Mr had the grilled radicchio salad. Both were prepared well and pretty tasty. We also ordered 2 more glasses of wine which came out pretty quickly. Then we were done and we waited once again.. and waited.. and waited.**Meanwhile the server assistant came and took our plates. I also asked where my new glass of wine was I had ordered at the beginning of the salad course. The assistant went to the bar and grabbed my glass of wine and was intercepted by our server who then snatched it from her hands. She then tossed her hair and brought me the glass. Now we had no silverware.. no water and a glass of wine. Then we waited and waited again.*Finally after 35 minutes our server told us the kitchen was backed up and that the entrees would be out in 5 minutes. We told her fine if it was only 5 minutes. We waiting this long, whats another 5 minutes? 5 minutes passed, then another 5, finally I called her over and asked for the check. She said the entrees were coming up soon I told her just the check please. She asked if we wanted them boxed. I told her sure. She brought the check out, 150 bucks.. I paid and left her only 10% which was VERY generous.. she brought the boxed entrees which we left on the table and stormed out.As you can see the Mr birthday dinner was squashed.. I got mad and paid to much for food we didn't eat. So much for an awesome dinner for his birthday. Now I feel embarrassed, let down and of course sad that I didn't show my man a good time on his once 40th birthday.What a real shame to what could have been a great place muddled by horrendous service. "The valley's premiere wine/dine destination".. yeah keep trying to believe that!Fine's Cellar is offering 50% off their entire food menu on Mondays until June so we had to check it out last night.  We ordered 3 apps: duck confit bratwurst w/sauerkraut, mac & cheese trio (blue cheese, truffle oil, peas & pancetta), pigs in a blanket (pork belly & caramelized onions wrapped in crepe); and a salad - Caesar b/c of the deepfried anchovy but was disappointed to find it lacklustre and cold. This dish was our least favorite with no eggs or bacon to be found. Romaine was left whole, just chopped in half lengthwise - didn't have enough dressing coverage this way.  All we tasted were the parmigiano shavings which overwhelmed the plate.and one main - Bacon crusted ribeye on blue cheese hash browns (requested w/o blue cheese). This was our favorite.  Ribeye was crusted with a tasty green substance which must have been the bacon.  Hash browns were very crispy.  Dish had lots of flavor and texture and begged for a glass of big red wine to accompany it.The food came out fast (probably b/c we went at 9:30 and they were ready to close up). Bites were not bad and many featured cheese, esp blue.  The star was definitely the ribeye on hash - very tasty ($28 before discount so only $14 after).  We'll be back on Mondays with this good a deal.Dropped by for "Drop-In Thursdays" weekly wine tasting and to try a few menu items. Sauvignon blanc was light and sweet, with very pronounced grapefruit notes. I liked Abundance Vineyards Abundantly Rich Red (Zinfandel and Carignane varietals)- fruity, not too sweet; This bottle sells retail at $14;, Fine's at $12.66- Thursday's special was $10... I should've bought two! I didn't like the cabernet much. (Honestly, I kept tasting paint thinner... not good eats, er, drinks.) Alright, I was now ready to order some food!My companion and I decided we'd try the Sweet potato fries, Housemade duck confit bratwurst, Escargot, and Fine's wine burger (please see photos above). While I didn't think much of the fries and the accompanying sauces (balsamic is slightly tangy; tomato is salty; and vanilla bean is just... sweet) at the beginning of the meal, I grew to enjoy them at the end- it was fun to experiment with the sauces to find good combinations!  I'm sure the wine tastings and the $5 glass of Calina Reserva Carménère had something to do with this!  The bratwurst was a winner, but at $11 for such a small portion (about a 2.5" link), I'll wait till 1/2 off Mondays to enjoy this one again. (I'll have to ask the chef to swap something for the slaw, w/c had good-looking bacon or pancetta mixed in, along with allergens I don't want.)  I was hesitant to try the escargot, esp. after trying Tapino's a few days ago, but I'm glad my friend ordered it, anyway. It was perfection on a plate!  Buttery, but not greasy, and I adored the chunky bits of garlic there!  I had thought of asking for more bread, but sometimes it's better to be left wanting for more than to have too much.  Merrill, our bartender, said that many people have opined that Fine's wine burger was the best burger they've ever had. Perhaps!  It certainly vies with the goodness of Quiessence's Farm burger.  It was beautiful to look at (cooked to medium rare), and equally tasty, with the caramelized onions the scene-stealer in this dish!  My friend was tickled by the battered pickles! Indubitably, they begged to be tasted, but I stood my ground.Can't wait for Mondays to roll around... Fine's Cellar undeniably deserves an early beg-off from work!
In-N-Out Burger=Five Stars for a fast food burger chain?Spring Break, 1974...I was a senior in college and my girlfriend, Susie, had more money than good sense (as evidenced by the fact that she was my girlfriend:)The answer to her question "what do you want to do for spring break?" was "let's take your new car and drive to LA and party on your credit cards!!!:)"That's where I had my first In-n-Out Burger after seeing bumper stickers and license plate frames everywhere around LA that said "In-n-Out  urge ":) So hilarious, so "in your face"...just a little bit dirty...for 1974:)I finally asked somebody where to get such a cool and in your face bumper sticker (that'll show the man:) and I found out about In-n-Out and fell in love...no, no...not with Susie:)I got my license plate frame... properly defaced it and for I while, I was the guy showin' the man:)Fast forward to San Ramon, CA in 1999 and In-n-Out opens its first NorCal store 9 miles from my house, with 3 hour drive through waits, police traffic control, news helicopters and all the rest, as tens of thousands of people flooded into San Ramon to get their "In-N-Out  urge" fulfilled:)...Pizzeria Bianco like waits to pungle up your $5 for a burger, fries and coke...whiskey tango foxtrot! (at least you can get In-n-Out to make your burger the way you want it:)What inspires this kind of mob rush?* Is it the cool red and white packaging, with the crossed palm trees (and little inscriptions like "John 3:16" and "Proverbs 3:5 printed in certain spots on the packaging)?* Is it the special secret (or not so secret) menu?...The Beautiful Carin always gets her burger "Animal style, Protein Style" ...I get my burgers "mustard grilled with extra toast" and we always get the fries "Well Done":)* Is it the simplicity of In-n-Out...they do burgers and fries...just burgers and fries...they do them pretty much any way you can think of...but they just do burgers and fries...simple and elegant:)* Is it the quality control they exercise over their stores? They do not franchise and they do not open a store more than 1 days drive from their warehouses in LA. They make certain that the ingredients are fresh (no frozen beef) and quality standards are equally high throughout the chain.* Is it in how they treat their employees? Everything I hear is that In-n-Out is the best fast food chain to work for, consistently paying more than MickieD's, Wendy's and the rest.I think it's the combination of all those things...What I do know is that they never get my order wrong, the people at In-n-Out are always happy to see me and friendly to me and the burgers and fries are always the best of any fast food chain (OK, not the best drive through burger in town...and you know who you are Lucky Boy:) So when the "In-n-Out urge" strikes, swing through In-n-Out Burger and get yourself a 3x3, mustard grilled, extra toast, a side of fries well done, and an extra large shake...That'll satisfy at least one of your In-n-Out urges...I can't help you with the other ones:)Sweet Animal style fries, Oh how good they are when HOT and the Cheeseburgers are always great too!!! Oh so good!!! ***The service is always GREAT!!! Such nice people work here!! :)I have reviewed other In-N-Out Burger locations, so it seemed strange I didn't have a review for this location since it is the one I most frequent (at least once a week). Seems more like "creeper fishy" to me, but anyways. This location is my favorite. I have been eating here since it opened and have never once had an issue. Consistency is clearly something In-N-Out Burger focuses on. The inside is always very clean as well the restrooms. The line inside as well the drive-thru can be crazy, but it's worth it. If eating inside it is best to go in with others so you have someone to order and get drinks so the other can scout out a spot to sit. The booths are hard to come by at peak times. The parking can fill up too, but recently they have added orange cones so there isn't as much congestion between the parking area and the drive-thru. Everybody pretty much knows the secret menu at In-N-Out Burger isn't so secret anymore. I love that the menu is so simple. When you know how to make something right, you don't need a large menu. Hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, shakes and drinks are what you will find here! For me this last visit (and pretty much every visit) I had a "Grilled Cheese W/Grilled Onions" (no lettuce) and it was perfect. Sometimes I get extra tomato, extra grilled onions or even ask that they add mustard. I also ordered "Animal Style Fries" and was glad hubby helped me eat them because it was a decent size. The chilies here are good and you can get them chopped on your burger or just on the side to munch on.  If you like to spoil your pooch then order a "Flying Dutchman" for them and they will thank you :) Hours:Sunday - Thursday 10:30 am-1:00 amFriday 10:30 am - 1:30 am Saturday 10:30 am - 1:30 amin the immortal words of the Bangles:If you want to find all the cops,They're hanging out in the In-N-Out.They sing and dance (Oh-Way-Oh)They spin their clock and cruise on down the block at least I think that is how it goes now =P Seriously they had about 4-5 squad cars here when I swung through late at night with a friend to get something on the way back to SURPRISE where we were staying. It is awesome that they are always open late. Pro Tip: Do not try and rob this location. You are likely to find more cops than in a doughnut shop grubben or chillaxen here!The grub was pretty tasty. Exactly what you would expect from In-N-Out. The double double was tasty. I stole some fries from my friend since I didnt wanna eat a lot of them. Carb overload on the fries ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh... i can feel the fat growing even now from the carbs... This place is tasty and worth a stop. Its everything you could want in a quick burger and is the only "fast food" joint just about that I will eat at on rare occasion. Enjoy it, it is tasty.Gambling is my addiction.  Vegas is my addiction.  Running is my addiction.  But this place...this is my everything.  I think this is the reason I keep coming back every couple months.  Not for gambling.  Not for drinking.  Not for running.  Not to see friends.  Maybe not even to see my parents.  I think it's because of the double-double meal.  And an extra fries animal style on top of that.  And possibly my parent's fries that they don't finish (sometimes i tend to overeat =)).I've been coming to this place for years and not once has it failed.  The week before i arrive my mom always calls and asks if i want to go to In-n-Out after I land.  Though this time i waited since i was running the half marathon on sunday, i wanted to make sure when i ate there it was THAT much better.  I dig their chocolate shake too, and not the wiener's circle kind.I think proximity factors into my rating, as i seriously crave this stuff when i'm in chicago.  Sometimes i lick my in-n-out sticker hoping the burger smell/taste is still there.  Oops did i just say that?  Let's ignore the last statement.  Also, they just opened an In-n-Out about 3 minutes from my parent's house, so this relationship may have competition.  Well, there's always room for 3.See you again in two weeks!In-N-Out burger has got to be the best burger out there for the price. I could live off of the double double protien style, no onions.  Yes I am their #1 fan. I even dressed up as an In-N-Out girl for Halloween.One Halloween my girlfriends and I decided to dress up as fast food girls instead of the usual bunnies, french maids, hookers, dominatrix, pirate wench's, basically the usual excuse for them bitches to dress up as sluts. We had a Krispy Kreme girl, A Hot dog on a Stick girl and me the In-n-Out girl.  I bought my shirt from their souvenir shop next to the restaurant. I also bought my hat, my apron and my larger than life safety pin to hold it all together. The souvenir shop sells it all.We went out that night and realized that we looked quite normal. My girlfriend got out her scissors and started cutting out our shirts, cutting our shorts shorter. So basically we were Fast Food Whores. I guess Halloween is really the one day of the year it's okay to be a slut.Sorry bout the rant, I love In-N-Out. 5 stars.I went here 3 times in 13 days.  It would've been more if my family wasn't grossed out by that fact.Oh Dear In-N-Out,How I love thee! Yet, I fear our long distance relationship will not last. The distance! Me turning away from meat (as much as possible)! And you, well you'll never change (and that's a good thing.)If you were closer it may work but for now let us depart on a good note and remember the happy times. There will always be a place in my heart (and stomach) for you sweet, sweet In-N-Out.Love,NaurryP.S. Can we still be (culinary) fuck buddies for those times I come into town?This is the busiest place you have ever been to. BUT the FASTEST service you've ever seen!According to Local News Sources this location serves 6-8000 hamburgers a day!!Almost every visitor to Las Vegas must have this location on their "to do list"-I do see lots of tourists taking pictures and raving about it as they sit and devour their burgers.Being a local I eat @IN_N_OUT_Burger pretty regularly so I like to change it up and do something different every now and again.I ordered a 4x4 w/pickles & onion ONLY plus a regular with everything. 2 orders of fries.Only the 4x4 was mine but it was a real challenge to eat it all-BUT  I was determined not to wuss out in front of my son.It's only $1 to add an extra patty w/cheese so dare to be different and next time go crazy and try a 10x10 !!  ps. The COOLEST thing about this location is the GIFT SHOP outback. You can get all those cool In-N-Out souvenirs you've been checking out in the brochures.As I sat in the back of my taxi, head reeling from last night's lack of sleep and numerous free casino drinks, pocket full of cash I won at Mandalay's blackjack tables, I thought to myself "the only thing that will make this day better is In-n-Out for breakfast. Fortunately I had just leaned out the back window to order two grilled cheese animal-style sandwiches and a large coke from the drive-thru at this burger mecca. The cab driver admitted that no, this was not the first, nor would it be the last, time that he had been hired to drive someone off the strip to score some 10:30am in-n-out. I was confident that this was the right decision. Twenty minutes later, as I sat across from the check-in counters at McCarran making a mess out of myself with delicious fast-food saucy cheese sandwiches, I thanked myself for making such a glorious call. In-n-Out truly is special. It's fast food that's WAY better than any other options out there. Fast, fresh, delicious, clean, cheap, and damn good. And this one has a big flashy light-up sign.As I've sat back and watched a debate unfold before me -both online and in person-  in regards to the "Which is better?" Shake Shack vs. In-N-Out Burger fight, I was always a little miffed that I didn't really have a dog in the fight. I was also upset that I don't use the word "miffed" anywhere near as much as it deserves to be used. So imagine my surprise and happiness when I found out that In-N-Out has an outpost in Vegas.In case you can't imagine it, it was kind of anticlimactic in that I didn't jump around or throw midgets in celebration. I was just really happy while sitting in a moving car.So, which is better? Subjectively, I would still say Shake Shack. The girl, however, who does not like any hamburger ever created, ate 75% of my Animal Style burger in the time it took me to take a sip of my milkshake (Neopolitan, because you have to order off the menu anytime you're given the opportunity in life). She then spent the rest of the trip, and nearly every day up to the time I'm writing this review, complaining that she hasn't had another one, but what does she know?I teetered between giving this place 3 or 4 stars.I like that they have a very limited menu. You have 4 options: burger, fries, soda and/or shakes. That limited menu allows for food to be made fresh and people too be served quickly.  I guess that is why they named the place in and out burger.  The burgers actually have seasoning on them.  It is always refreshing to bite into a burger and have your taste buds thank you.  You can tell they are using quality meat, and not filler meats like other places.I have to admit one thing though, the burger is too small for my liking. I ordered the 2 meat, 2 cheese burger, a.k.a. the double-double, and actually had room for another burger.  Fries are average. You will not see this restaurant's fries in your grocery freezer like some other places has it for themselves!  Shakes are decent but small as well. With that limited menu, you truly know what to expect when you go there. Outside them asking you if you want onions on your burger, grilled or non grilled, there aren't too many surprises with this place.  I did not try the lemonade to see if it was special.  3.5 star experience rounded to 4 stars.While eating here, my friends claimed that this was the best In-N-Out they have ever had.  I thought it tasted almost the same as every other In-N-Out I have been to.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious and still highly recommended!  However, I have learned that everything tends to taste much better to people who have been consuming mass amounts of alcohol.For out-of -towners unfamiliar with In-N-Out, it is a must try!  There menu is simple and excellent.  There are only a few things on the menu, but it is about as good as fast food gets.  They also have a secret menu where you can customize your meal a ton of different ways, but I would suggest that first timers stick to the basics.I got the #1 combo when I visited here.  It consisted of a Double-Double ( a burger with double meat and cheese), fries, and a fountain drink.  It was not as magical as my friends made it out to be, but it really hit the spot for me and was super tasty.I am always down for some In-N-Out, and this location did not disappoint!In-n-out is all about consistently great quality burgers. One of my favorite places to get good food fast. I usually order a cheeseburger with no onions, add pickles, protein style. But sometimes I'm craving something a little more fattening (usually after a night of drinking, and I opt for the French fries animal style (no onions though) So good... so bad... but sooo good!!!This location can get pretty busy during lunch time.. But that is to be expected.They also have great fresh brewed iced tea. Staff is friendly!This is the busiest In N Out location I have ever seen. It's easy to understand why because of its proximity to the strip and easy accessibility to the freeway for tourists and locals alike. Because it's so busy, I do try to avoid this location as often as I can, but I was craving In N Out and this was the closest location, so we made the exception. Despite how busy they were, they have the whole process down pat. The line goes relatively quickly and the service is as great as any other location.This is the OG location. It's busy pretty much anytime it's open. The lines move along quicker here than you'd think because they have enough staff on hand to handle the long lines. There is also a gift shop next door  to this location so you can get your in n out merch without paying shipping fees. I hadn't been to this location in a minute because I experienced some issues with my order not being correct which is hardly the case with in n out but I have been by recently several times and it's been on point. I ask for my burger different ways depending on what sounds good each time and my order has been just the way I order it. I go inside sometimes but the drive thru works best for me because getting a place to sit inside at this location can take longer than it takes to get your food more times than not. Being near the strip and one of the first recognizable signs coming into Vegas it's a given that this place will be popping. If you like chilies then ask for chopped chilies on your burger and thank me later.In the last 3+ years, I've taken 3 trips to Cali and/or Vegas.  One thing is for certain, a trip out west is not complete without a visit to In-N-Out Burger.  On my trip earlier this month, I was fortunate to have In-N-Out Burger twice, once in Los Angeles (at a wedding!) and once at this location just off the famed Las Vegas strip.Going to In-N-Out is always an experience.  The restaurant sign is reminiscent of all the bright neon lights of the strip.  You pull into the parking lot and it's packed with cars, plus at least 5 taxi cabs too.  When you walk into the restaurant, there is a line to take your order, but it moves at a decent pace.  Above the counter is the menu.  It's pretty simple and minimalist.  The hubby and I ordered two Cheeseburgers at $2.45 each and an order of Fresh French Fries at $1.65.  Including tax our order came to $7.08.  Wow!  That's the cheapest, most affordable meal we had in our 4 days in Las Vegas.  My husband called me a cheap date!  But hey, when you have an In-N-Out craving, nothing else will suffice.There is definitely an interesting crowd inside the restaurant, so we opted to take our food to go and brought it back to our hotel room to have with a bottle of red wine, classy I know.I really wish In-N-Out Burger would expand to the East Coast, but I'm also pretty sure this will never happen as all of their food is fresh and never frozen, so it cannot travel too far from their processing centers.I highly recommend stopping here on your next trip to Vegas!This is all American food.  I'm calling it Ethnic, because American is an ethnic group too and they don't have a fast food grouping.Hey!  I'm a California girl; we love our burgers the In & Out way.  Always fresh, always made to order and always made right. Drive through or dine in.  The drive through is surprisingly fast.  The inside dining gets crowded at meal times but it usually works out that by the time your food is ready a table opens up.  On a nice day there are plenty of outside tables to take advantage of.Kid friendly dining with lots of high chairs.  They keep it pretty clean even when it's busy. Best fries on the planet because they are made ultra fresh right before your eyes.  Watch the guy take a  fresh potatoe and slice it and then fry it.  I like mine extra well done.  Not a problem at I&O.  They make it the way you want it.  Add on grilled onions with or without your slice of raw onion.  No prob.Full slices of onions (none of those dehydrated minced things that look like lice on your burger), rich ripe red tomatoes (not pink; red and ripe)and whole leaves of lettuce (none of that shredded stuff with brown edges).  The buns are baked fresh everyday too.  Fresh, fresh, fresh and juicy.On a diet?  In and Out invented the protein burger over 40 years ago.  All the other fast food places are imitators.  In California we called it a Rabbit Burger.  All your burger goodies stacked on whole lettuce leaves and lovingly wrapped.  Messy and yummy.Animal Style - it's not on the menu but you can make your burger or fries Animal Style - adds grilled onions and more condiments.On your fries it adds cheese, onions and thousand island sauce - Wow!  They (unfortunately) charge extra for it now.  Oh well, if you tell em to leave off the cheese they will not charge the extra $1.85 on to the fries though.Top off your meal with a real made from ice cream shake.  Everyone else has finally followed suit on this one too.  Used to be you could only find ice milk being used.  I & O always used ice cream and still does.Nice fat straws too - not those skinny ones that you have to suck your brains out to get a good slurp.Pick up a cool t shirt and bumper sticker while you are there and show your burger love to the world!Dang!  I've made myself hungry writting this reveiw.  Think I will head on over for some comfort food!Sunday through Thursday 10:30 a.m.-1:00 a.m.Friday and Saturday 10:30 a.m.-1:30 a.m.Things I Like That I Know I Shouldn't:Pickle juice straight from the jar."Rock Star" by Nickelback.A 4x4 with animal style fries from In-N-Out.The "secret menu" is the best practical joke since Mariah Carey's movie career. It's not secret (In-N-Out has the damn thing posted on its website) and it's not much of a menu as it is just more combinations of food and condiments (except maybe the Grilled Cheese). Yet for all my mockery, I myself am obsessed with this fast food phenomenon. Out of going to In-N-Out for two years, I haven't ordered anything off the "regular menu" in 23 months. And even then, I make one of my awestruck lackeys do it for me. It's become campus lore that if you owe Jetta a favor, expect visit In-N-Out holding a sheet of pink paper with the most nonsensical order in the history of lunch runs written on it in pink lettering.Jetta helped you get a 90 on that test? Flying Dutchman with well done fries. Jetta came in on her day off to cover your shift in the computer lab? Grilled Cheese, light fries, and a neopolitan shake. Jetta talked your boyfriend into agreeing to a threesome with your and your best friend? You better keep it coming, because all 3x3s and animal style fries in the world will not get that harrowing, harrowing memory out of my fucking head.While the life of a secret menu-aire may seem glamorous, it does have it pitfalls. Occasionally I send out for a protein burger (comes wrapped in a lettuce bun) and instead get a 2x2 with no condiments. Or I asked for "extra toast" and got a little baggie of slightly burnt buns. Oh, and who can forget the time I sent out for In N Out and got back a bag of McDonald's and a scolding on how it is very mean to write down an order with items that aren't on the menu. That's how I discovered McDonald's southwest chicken sandwich. Following the secret menu is like following UFOs or cryptozoology. It's rewarding when you find a location that provides your mysterious heart attack sandwich, but other times you (or the person you sent to get your lunch) end up looking like an idiot in front of the cashier. Still, the thrill of the plunder is worth the hassle and risk of embarrassment. Sure, that calorie bomb was never meant for human consumption, but fuck it, it was on the secret menu. It's practically a treasure. I guess that's the ultimate joy of the In N Out experience. Getting something that (at least we are lead to believe) the average casual fast foodie does not get to experience. Fuck the casual eaters. Only real drive-thru pirates deserve the good shit.After phenomenal In-N-Out experiences in Cali and subpar ones in Texas, I was initially nervous about the In-N-Out in AZ, more specifically Peoria. It is a slight notch below Cali, but certainly miles ahead of Dallas. Plus, I've learned that no matter what, animal style makes everything better. Yes, everything.A double-double with french fries drenched in the animal style goo is always my go to and if I'm feeling extra saucy, I'll throw in a shake on top of it. I got all of the above here and while the burger was up to par, the fries and the shake were definitely under par. Dry potatoes and a hard shake made for tough consumption, but 1st world problems for spending less than $6 for a fattening meal would lead me to complain less and not more.Service was pretty standard. Efficient, almost military precision in assembling my tray of heart attack worthy fast food. Impressive, considering how often they must deal with lines and rude tourists who know nothing about In-N-Out. What I still wouldn't give to have one of these in NYC ...After being in Portland for quite some time, I've been craving for the good ol' In-N-Out Burger!I convinced my grandma to make a pit-stop here for my usual:#2 with grilled onions + fries + strawberry shake = happy tummy!Service here was quite superb! Friendly, fast and no frills! This location is very close to the 215 freeway, so you can't miss it! Thanks, In-N-Out for satisfying my cravings!I usually give the nod to California for the best In-N-Out spots, but this LV version along Eastern has completely won me over. This will be the same story reiterated countless others have told over and over: Animal Style. Hungry. Win.This isn't the only In-N-Out in LV of course, just simply one of the best. Every drive-thru and dining in visit has been the same high quality, gut bombing, palate pleasing, quintessential fast food laden experience one could ever want. Double double with animal style or a 3x3 or 4x4 for the adventurous? Done and done. Skip the fries and shoot for a shake, the burgers here are the real story.And like all good things in Vegas, it's open late. 1AM on the week days and 1:30AM for the weekends. They would dominate the late night crowd (as if they weren't busy enough) if they managed to stay open past 4AM.A different location but same great service, same great food! In-N-Out is always busy.  The drive through line is long but moves quickly.  Dining inside is the same.  Long line but again, moves very quickly.   The cashiers here are so friendly.  Service has been on point at every location I've dined at.  It's great to have the consistency across the board.  Burger and fries? Cheap, quick and delicious! My fries I request well done animal style.  Cheese, onions and sauce smothering the fries - I just can't get enough! As far as fast food burgers, this is my go to place! Love it!It's In-N-Out versus the world. Which says something, when everyone is willing to hate on your product at the drop off a single animal style fry. Is the food good?, Yes. You have to try really hard to mess up a burger and fries, but, I'm not here to talk about the delicious treats served here, but the service. This is the kind of place that will literally do anything within reason to serve its customers...- You want neapolitan shake?... coming right up. - You want animal style fries on your double double and you want it protein style?... You got it. - Grilled cheese?... got it!- You want an animal style milkshake?... small or medium? You really have to fail at life if you can't properly order from this menu. Even if it's you're first time here, because the menu is so basic. Burgers, fries, and shakes. Done!  Beyond the one million food algorithms you can create here, the prices are still considerably lower than any other fast food place. I mean my order is almost always under six dollars and is sufficient enough to feed the beast. A double double, fries, and water. Yeah. I don't drink soda. Plus the food is good! Don't believe the haters. No one really hates In-N-Out, besides vegetarians, but they have veggies options available! Really, anyone who hates In-N-Out is probably just a spiteful jerk who looks for the bad in everything. I can name a few people right now... Skeletor, Thanos, Tuco from Breaking Bad, Cosmo G. Spacely from the Jetsons, and a few humans on YT. P.S. - If you go late at night. Go inside, it's faster than drive through. America!
Chili Man=When I first started working Uptown I wanted to get a "street hotdog" since I had always associated the downtown life with a great frank (don't ask me why, maybe too many movies). On my third day on the job I went to find a hotdog stand and was successful. However, it was just a plain jane hot dog with a little ketchup and mustard. Good but not really anything to look forward to again.Fast forward a few weeks. I am walking the streets of Tryon looking for something to inspire my palette because I'm in one of those rare moods where I just can't decide what I'm hankering for.I came across the Chili Man stand on Tryon between 4th and Trade and saw a few people ordering and being chatted up by the owner. Loving verbal engagement I wandered over and stood in line meanwhile listening to a random story being recounted by the Chili Man himself.There are essentially two main options on the menu: Hotdogs and Brats.Fortunately I happen to like both and ordered one of each.Then I got to pick my toppings for my meal. For my brat I just got brown mustard and Sauerkraut (major kudos for even offering a brat with kraut, which is surprisingly rare). I took my dog based on his recommendation which included spicy mustard, spicy ketchup, chili and cheese.I will say both were great but the chili just put things over the edge. It did not seem like a generic canned chili and I have been told (though not confirmed) that he makes it himself. It would not surprise me. It does not matter if you don't have cash because he is up on the digital age and can accept credit cards.So the food is fantastic but one thing that makes you want to come back and what puts this place at the top of my Uptown lunch list (besides the chili) is Vic "the Chili Man" himself. I do not think this man has ever met a stranger. He always has a great story or conversation topic that has nothing to do with the weather, sports or politics. It is refreshing to say the least. If you are ever in a downcast mood, this man can lift your spirits with a good conversation or story. He is not intentional about it, it is just who he is.Come for the dogs, hang around the cart for the conversation. Be prepared to repeat.Let's just say that Chili Man IS The Man!  The guy takes the time to make his own ketchup and spicy mustard so that should tell you something right there.  The dogs he serves are seared to perfection on his carts flat top and my goodness, he's not called Chili Man for nothing.  This is some darn good chili he puts on the dogs.  As others have noted, if he weren't Chili Man, he would be Chatty Man because the dude has never met a stranger and you are guaranteed some lively conversation as he works on your food.  An A+ street food vendor and his work is much appreciated.Hot dogs are my jam, I can eat hot dogs anytime of the day, when I'm traveling, I will buy a hot dog and take a couple of bites even if I have just eaten, just for the love of hot dogs.  When I read about The Chili Man, I couldn't believe I didn't know about him! I once was lost but now I'm found.Weekdays (except Monday) you can find The Chili Man's food cart parked in front of BofA and Chima on Tryon.  He is serving up delicious hot dogs with homemade chili, slaw, mustard and spicy ketchup.  I would recommend going with someone so you can order three or four and cut them in half, so you can try different styles!!Food cart, canned soft drinks, chips.Well, this is my 300th review and I can't think of anyone more deserving of it than the Chili Man. Sidenote: I'm writing this review while eating a salad. This is the definition of torture.I know what you're thinking, 300 reviews and she's giving 5 stars to a hot dog street vendor?! Vic is a lot more than that. He takes great pride in making quality toppings and creative menu options. On top of great food, he is a one man show. If there's a line, it is completely worth the wait. From his stories and anecdotes, to the menu descriptions and Chili Man facts, you'll have a giant smile on your face the entire time. You can't possibly have a bad day when you see Vic.On to the food, he has different specials during the week. Follow him on Facebook and Twitter to see what he's got cooking. #SeeWhatIDidThere. Vic has told me for weeks that I need to get the Life Changer. I don't want to say a hot dog changed my life, but hot damn I do believe it did. It definitely deserves that name. Cheese, chili, Chili Man's designer taco sauce, homemade spicy mustard, jalapenos and onion. HOLY. Like, holy should be in 72 pt font. I also got a dog with kraut and homemade spicy mustard. It took a lot of restraint to only eat two hot dogs.Things to know: don't see something on the named menu you like? Don't worry, you can build your own. Dogs come with unlimited toppings. Say what?! He does take a credit card. Don't work uptown and need a place to park? I like to park a couple blocks away on Poplar between 3rd and 4th streets. There are meters here and it's way cheaper than the parking decks. Don't have change? Use the park mobile app. Takes all of maybe ten seconds to park and pay. And trust me, you'll be thankful for that little walk back to your car after the dogs.Review #300 is in the books. Here's to the next 300!
Byblos - Le Petit Café=I've been there only for breakfast. They serve you what they call Feta omelet: a secret mixture of, well, feta, eggs, butter and dill. Sounds ramdom, but tastes like no eggs you've ever had before.You can also choose to go with the date omelet, or the oriental one. If you order the "combo", you'll get a coffee, homemade bread and homemade jam (the waitress will overwhelm you with her rose-carrot-ginger-orange-pistachio-lime - and it goes on...-  list of possible flavors) for about 9$. A deal.Very exotic, all of it served in a beautiful place, all of wood, with windows wide open during the Summer. The only downer: the service is kinda slow... It's usually because the owner and her daughter are fighting about something, which is actually worth the wait.Plus, the neighborhood is great: young and familial, with cheese and bread shops, organic and clothes stores. Everything you think Montreal should be!Keep your eye out for all the Québec celebrities hanging out in this joint!! Not that you will necessarily recognize them if you don't live here, but anyhow, they usually wear sunglasses at night. Like our very Corey Hart.
ZuZu Cafe & Market=A friend and I stopped by the ZuZu Cafe with our brood of small children after a trip to the zoo.  I was extremely impressed with both the atmosphere and the food.  There were plenty of open tables, as well as a nice outdoor area. I've heard there is a sandbox, but that was not open the day we were there. They also had a small children's space with books and  few toys. The staff was very friendly and just smiled when our kids acted...well...like kids often act.As for the food, I had "The Henry" which a hummus and vegetable pita. It was excellent!  The pita was tasty and the hummus was very flavorful. The veggies looked like they might have been picked from somebody's garden.  Seriously - super fresh!!  I ate the entire thing in about five minutes because it was so good I couldn't put it down. My friend had the hummus plate which was equally delicious, and my kids ate "the CHOCOLATE sandwich!!!" aka: a Nutella pita. They were very, very excited about this. We also got two cookies to share: a snickerdoodle and a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie. Both were fantastic. Soft and sooo good. I may or may not have kept all of the peanut butter chocolate chip one for myself.  The prices were decent - I wouldn't say "cheap" but definitely on par with what I am willing to pay to eat at a quality local eatery.  I feel like a cafe next to the zoo called "Zuzu" could very easily have been a hokey, overpriced restaurant with mediocre food, but these guys did it right.  Good service and excellent food. I can't wait to go back and try "The Spooner." ;)
Woodlands Vegetarian South Indian Kitchen=Went again for lunch! Yuuummmm yummmmm Polished off a huge bowl of Curry Eggplant! Its so fucking delicious!!! Hawaiian guy and Indian girl i went with loved it as well. It IS a bit more spicy then your run of the mill average Indian joint. So be aware of that. I am sure they will be happy to tone it down for you, but then, of course, you toning down your experience. I loved it as is. Its awesome and i am sure as hell coming back!PLEASE!!! P L E A S E do not listen to retards who bash this place for various stupid non-related shit!!! Stop by and try it. I brought half a dozen people there at various times and not one walked away disappointed - From actual Indian people to Alabama hick, to Scottsdale snob to average Joe.I'm not sure when this place opened, but I cannot believe it took me this long to get here!They have a TON of vegan options and several gluten-free options which make them hella-rad in my book! This is a pay-at-the-counter-and-eat-off-of-paper-plates type of place, which is fine by me because it keeps the costs down and the portions large!I had the gobi manchurian (SO AMAZING) and the spiced rice. My dining partner had one of the platters and she was loving every bit of it.I will be back... watch out!
Woo=Empty restaurant on a Saturday night in Vegas.  Highly suspect.  Our waiter introduces himself and explains that the restaurant is tapas-style Chinese cuisine.  In order to properly feed our group of 10, we would have to order 2 of everything.  The culprits: Baby back ribs w/ honey tamarind glaze ($10).  These were ok.  Nothing special.  Spicy Thai shrimp with garlic basil lettuce wraps ($10).  A little too salty for our liking.  Calamari w/ serrano peppers ($15): this was probably one of my favorites.  Crispy with some heat to it.  Lemon chicken ($21): pass...pass...pass.  Lastly my other favorite of the evening was steak served over grilled rice (similar to grilled onigiri).  Delicious.  Overall, the food was just ok.  For the price that we paid per item, I expected better.  Service could also have been better.  Considering the restaurant was empty, you'd expect more attention from your server.
Sushi Loca=The servers walk around like lost puppies.I don't understand the need for sexually explicit names for items on the menus or the attire. The decor of this restaurant is so upscale, but the uniforms of the staff is like a beer barn or something.The sushi was okay, I've had better.We won't be back.Okay..I will try to be fair here with Sushi Loca.  Keep in mind, 3 stars doesn't mean that this place is horrible.  It just means Sushi Loca was just okay.Let's start with the restaurant and service.  This is one of the bigger sushi restaurants that you'll find out here. I dig the decor, colors, and huge sushi bar.  As for service, they strive at this as well.  I had zero issue with their service and ambiance. Good start so far. Now for what's important, the food.  I didn't try their $9.95 two-item lunch special, but this seemed to be the trend for every one else that was eating here.  By the looks of what people were eating, looks like a great deal with huge portions. I chose their fish only dishes which were their;-Yellow Tail and Salmon Sashimi:  Probably the highlight of my lunch. Fresh, not fishy, and thick slices of fishes.  Some people like their shashimi thinly cut, but it doesn't matter to me as long as it's tasty and fresh.  Sushi Loca got this right.-Spicy Tuna and Salmon Skin Hand Roll:  Compared to other sushi spots, these hand rolls are a lot bigger.  Regarding taste, I've had better.  -Taste Like My X-Girlfriend:  This is one of their Extraordinary Rolls (aka Yum Yum Rolls).  Regarding the name, which girlfriend are they talking about?  No but seriously, their Extraordinary Rolls had names like "Love My Ass", "I Did Your Girlfriend", "Taste Like My X-Girlfriend" and "Sex on the Beach".  The names are amusing, but not the type of menu that you give to your young kids to read.  I will dabble in a few Western Rolls every once in a while.  I only did it here because I was just curious.  The "Taste Like My X-Girlfriend" consist of shrimp tempura, crab, scallops, spicy tuna, and all of this was covered with their crunch sauce. I didn't think it was bad.  It just had too much going on.  If I get this next time, I will probably tell them to cut the crunch sauce and mayo. The food here isn't bad depending what you get. I'm not a fan of the rolls I got, but loved their shashimi.  But because this place lacked AYCE, I had to spend all I can spend.  Overall, nothing really special here at Sushi Loca. I spent close to $50 for the same quality that I could have gotten at Yummy, I-Naba, and Kazien at half the price.So I've been dying to try this place because they have a good looking menu and good reviews... Unfortunately I will never return! When our food came to the table the waitress had brought a sauce along with our rolls so I thought is came with it. We had been eating the sauce and the waitress comes back to the table and said "oh sorry you didn't order this, sorry" takes it off of our table and I watched her place it on another table.. Are you f*cking kidding me? So UNSANITARY!! I can only imagine what goes on behind the kitchen if they think that doing that is ok! Oh and also my "cooked" roll came out with raw scallops.. And that's not my thing!
Senor Miguel's=Located inside Sun Coast.We stopped by and were looking at the menu, it was unimpressive and didn't look appetizing.The restaurant was completely empty with only the staff that worked there. We stood for awhile looking at the menu but no one came out to greet us or welcome us in.Judging by the unattentiveness and lack of patrons, I doubt we would ever eat here.
Texas Roadhouse=We started eating before we were at our table.  We helped ourselves to the roasted peanuts that seem to be everywhere in this restaurant.  The peanuts are roasted just right and have just enough saltiness.When we were seated we were brought some hot rolls fresh out of the oven.  They were so hot and fresh that we could barely pick them up.  They were served with room temperature butter - perfect for spreading - that had been mixed with a touch of cinnamon-sugar and I enjoyed 2 of these rolls.I next got a salad as one of my side dish choices.  I chose a Caesar salad.  They put out a rather nice Caesar salad.  I found the dressing to be flavorful but not overwhelming with fishiness as some Caesar dressing can be.I ordered a Blue Moon ale which they have on tap.  It is a nice, full bodied lager which I found quite satisfying.The main course arrived and I enjoyed my second side item, baked beans.  They were somewhat heavy on BBQ sauce but made with hearty beans and plenty of chunks of flavorful pork.Oh, they also brought out a slab of ribs, about 16 bones.  I ate one.It was tender and delicious.  I'll eat the rest of the ribs tomorrow.Went back again since the last time I was there the steak was so good. We were seated as we walked in the door, asked if we had been there before and since this was the newest of several visits, I thought I knew what I was expecting that is until we ordered drinks. We both ordered a beer and were promptly asked for our ID. Now I have no hair on my head (not by choice) and look a ton older than 21 (I'm 34). I didn't have my id with me. The waitress said let me go check with my manager. After a minute or so the manager comes over and informs us she cannot serve me alcohol because I have no id. I told her about the money she would be losing tonite since I am obviously older than 21 at which point she said "this is the sound of my heart breaking" in the most you've mistaken me for someone who cares attitude.  What the sound actually was, was the sound of money leaving her restaurant and never returning. Had she simply explained why they couldn't, no problem. No need to be condescending about it. Due to her attitude, we left and found someplace else to eat and will never be back to the Texas roadhouse.
City Centre Cafe=Total east coast dive deli... and there's nothing wrong with that. CCC is a place that has what you're looking for when you need a quick lunchtime meal. Coffee, fresh cookies, daily soup specials, salads, wraps, hot 'wiches. It's all there. While the menu on the wall lists about 20 items, don't be afraid to make a custom sammie. They have a decent selection of breads, meats, cheeses and toppings for you to make a beautiful lil' hoagie for yourself. While nothing will blow you away here, it's nice to know that there's still a sandwich shop in town with a friendly owner running the place and some homemade food on the specials board.
Stratta=My group came here for our pre-clubbing dinner.  We had reservations, so we were able to be seated fairly quickly.  We shared the Caesar salad and fried calamari for our starters.  I ordered the Roasted Pork Chop with Sage and Garlic and the Crispy Fried Potatoes with Truffle Oil and Parmesan Cheese for the table to share.  My friends ordered the Penne with Chicken and Baked Lasagna.  My pork chop was delicious.  It was nice and juicy, and the fontina cheese and prosciutto stuffing gave it an extra burst of flavor.  There were caramelized apples which gave it a sweet flavor and complimented the pork chop very well.  The truffle fries are a must.  They were super crispy and the Parmesan cheese and truffle oil made my mouth water.  We didn't finish all the fries, so I packed them to go and they still tasted super good later even though they got cold.The prices are reasonable considering its Vegas.  Its not the place to go if you're looking for a cheap meal, but it also won't break the bank.
Taj Mahal Indian Cuisine=Let's call it a very strong 4 stars plus. We came for dinner and it was all about the food at this family owned restaurant baby!Our server Harpreet (she also goes by Happy) was charming and knowledgeable. Taj Mahal offers the dinner menu dishes with a spiciness scale of 1-10. Since we were dining with the kids we went on the low end of the scale. We started with garlic naan and garlic cauliflower. Two quotes I have on the garlic naan are: ..."best garlic naan ever!" and "Uh-Maze-Ing". The garlic cauliflower was a complete surprise. We wanted to try something different and Harpreet strongly recommended this. She said if you don't like cauliflower don't worry. Even though none of us are big fans of cauliflower we decided to try it out. Wow! Wonderfully garlicky and bursting with flavor! When we go back that is a must have. For the entrees we shared navratan korma and chicken tikka masala. Both were marvelously colorful and flavor full. As I write this I am forced to cover my keyboard with a napkin so that it doesn't short out from all the drooling produced by talking about the food we had. The service was straight up 5 star. The food solid 4-5 star range. I would put the atmosphere at 3 stars but come here for the food. I have not tried the buffet but I expect it would not be to the same freshness and quality.Having been here twice - once for dinner with the family and once for "UYE - Yelp Goes Indian", I feel it's time to weigh in.  On both our visits we were treated to impeccable service and incredible food.  The owners, Hapreet and her husband, make sure that when you leave you have been well fed and well cared for.We ordered similarly both times.  We love the garlic cauliflower and garlic naan.  I got korma both times, first navratan and then lamb.  My kids love chicken tikka masala and my husband, Jim W, always wants something different.  This time we added onion bhaji, which I love, and Jim got some spicy paneer that I didn't try.Here's the dish on this place:  These are really nice folks.  The food is delicious.  The service is impeccable.  Go.It burns so good, I can't wait to return to Taj Mahal. As part of a large group attending the UYE here, I must say that Taj Mahal really blew me away. We were fortunate enough to be sitting with Ayesha and Aileen, both of whom knew what to order and how to order it sufficiently spicy. Our app was the samosa and channa chat (heat level 8). Initially, it seemed a bit too hot and we decided to order at a level 7 when we returned; however, I feel that 8 was just the right amount of spiciness to balance out the robust flavors. Next, we moved on to snacking of Aileen's keema naan, which was stuffed with minced lamb and was a good transition from the fires in our mouths. Our entree was the saffron seek kabab, served sizzling hot in an iron skillet and positively to live for. While pretty much everyone in attendance ordered their own entrees, we were able to sample a wide array of Indian delicacies. And, honestly, we tried so many wonderful dishes that I can't even begin to tell you what all I ate. But it was all excellent and delicious. We pretty much took over this restaurant. The service was excellent, given our large number and ordering at the same time. As our fragrant dishes came out in waves, it was clear the level of professionalism and perfection the staff applies. They even went above and beyond by providing complimentary desserts! I heard they were good (I don't eat sweets so I go on what I'm told about such matters). All things considered, Taj Mahal is a jewel of an establishment that is a pleasant drive from CenPho. The fact they have a good number of lamb dishes only adds to the allure of this restaurant. Thumbs way up, Taj Mahal! I cannot wait to return for some terrific Indian cuisine.Thanks to the cable guy being a guest in our home until 8 pm last night, we missed the Yelp event.  So in an attempt to undo also missing a previous event at Taj Mahal, we decided to come here.Typical strip mall restaurant with minimal decor, but it was clean and pleasant.  It surprised me to see a bar off to the side and India's version of MTV on the overhead television.  There was only one other diner in the restaurant-good for me, bad for them.  We started with the garlic cauliflower.  Loved it!  For my appetizer I went with the ever popular chicken tikka masala...chicken, onion, and bell pepper in a tomato based sauce.  You can choose heat level up to 10.  I prefer spicy, but mild dishes with just a hint of heat.  Ordering a 1 fit the bill.  The garlic naan was probably the best I have had of the 3 or 4 places I have been to.  For dessert we had gulab gamun, fried cheese balls soaked in sugar syrup.  I had never had this before, so I have no basis of comparison, but I didn't really like it.  I guess I expected it to to be cheesier and crispier and to be served hot (it was warm).  Oh well, can't win 'em all.Our service was great.  I would have been disappointed had it been anything less with no one else in the restaurant for most of the meal.  I can see Taj Mahal being a somewhat regular stop on our rotation.  They just need some more customers...well when we're not there anyway.I haven't gotten baked in many years...I can't afford the calories or the loss of cognitive function any longer...there is just no more margin for error!But there was this movie playing on the flat panel right above me...and it made me feel like I had gone down the rabbit hole one more time!The movie was about this Indian girl and her well meaning but "excitable" brothers...what a bunch of goofballs!They seemed to be stoned, too!And there was an Indian Nobleman (a Rajah?) who was sort of interested in the girl and rode a white horse through her living room!And there was lots of wrestling and tickling and witty banter between the brothers and the sister ("bunny, what do you keep in your hat?...brains?!?!")I felt like I had gone back 35 years, rolled a fattie of Oregon's Finest (and I can vouch for the fact that it was extraordinarily fine) and was sitting around watching a normal evening at the Kwik-e-Mart in Sweet Home!Just takin' it all in, man...abiding...I was mesmerized and charmed by this incomprehensible Bollywood spectacle as I had my chicken korma lunch special (the buffet is gone...lunch specials are the new reality...the "altered" reality).Tasty, tasty stuff, with garlic naan, raita and an assortment of chutney's, with the heat ramped up to "11" for me, making for a very entertaining and pleasant lunch.If they had a black light in there and maybe a little more sitar, Taj would have really blown my mind, man!Or if had just gotten toasted before lunch:-)
DJ Bibingkahan=One of my favorite eating spots in Las Vegas.  I've been to other Filipino restaurants in LV and this one by far surpasses them all.  This cafeteria style restaurant has the largest selection of Filipino cuisine.  Think of any Filipino dish....and they will have it!  It can be pretty overwhelming at first because there are just too many dishes to choose from.  I recommend going with more than 2 people so you can share different dishes.  I usually go here during lunch and I'll be full until way after dinner.  Their two-item combos are killer with large servings...and for less than $5, you'll be more content here than eating at a more expensive restaurant on the strip.  Make sure they serve your dishes in separate bowls so you can share them around the table.  Here are just a few flavorful dishes that I've enjoyed here throughout the years:LaingChicken AdoboLechon Kuwali Kare Kare Pork AdoboChicken ApritadaPaksiw na Pata MenudoBBQ chicken Beef CalderetaSinigang na BaboyPalabokPinakbetDinuguan Halo Halo....and that's only scratching the surface.  They have more items laid out....all nice and hot.  Oh and let's not forget...they offer Nilaga soup with your dine-in order (by the cashier).  Service is good...never had a problem with that.  However, cleanliness can sometimes be questionable.  The cheap prices and wide variety of great tasting authentic Filipino food explain why I've never seen this restaurant without a line.  But don't worry, the line goes pretty quick....especially when you're having trouble deciding what two items to get.  If you're ever stuck in that rut, go ahead and get three items!  Just don't expect to eat again until the next day.-mga kababayan ko, dapat lang malaman nyo, bilib ako sa kulay ko ako ay.....pilipino-o di va? an sarap naman! tapos gusto ko yun kapeterya style na turo-turo!-may handang tumulong sa yo at kumuha ng order mo, walang mabagal na hintay-an daming pagpipilian, as in super-buti di ako nakatira sa las begas, siguro tataas cholesterol ko dito=MURA NA MASARAP PA! TSIBUGAN NA, TAGAY PA!Okay....since my last review, the prices did go up....about a dollar or so.  But still is worth every dime!  For the amount of food they gave me on my last visit, I still felt like a winner.....a full winner!  Compared to most Filipino restaurants, they still have the largest selection, and they are still generous in portions...enough to share.   I love visiting this restaurant.  It brings me back to the Philippines with their delicious authentic food and TFC on the tube!  Wowoweee!
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store=I love Cracker Barrel.  Having first experienced it 12 yrs ago in the South, I was pleased to find one in nearby Mesa.  Some of my favorite dishes:Sunrise Sampler (Eggs, Bacon, Hash Browns, Grits, Apple, Biscuits & Gravy)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GAyHbuUTtKAdpHiFGJuezQ?select=Mjsj2CZ2GgLwp8FHZWuVqQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GAyHbuUTtKAdpHiFGJuezQ?select=DTLjwZ6D_A1_F3rHNIStiQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GAyHbuUTtKAdpHiFGJuezQ?select=k4mCERWR9ePXHvKXtkCo3gWhole Grain Pancakes w/Bacon & Eggshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GAyHbuUTtKAdpHiFGJuezQ?select=xyRLO-ivSRUBbKDSjV9KOAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GAyHbuUTtKAdpHiFGJuezQ?select=PsJOSxXEte8MYW63yhpxjwPeach Teahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GAyHbuUTtKAdpHiFGJuezQ?select=aQUTQPAKPlVpYmOajJrxnAThis location is just as good as the ones I remember in the South.  The country store is also very cool and full of goodies.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GAyHbuUTtKAdpHiFGJuezQ?select=pgRb_mM_ZcvoKEMgoc69fwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GAyHbuUTtKAdpHiFGJuezQ?select=Ix6MVNHBlBgT9qh-JtmJjwOverall, one of my favorite breakfast joints.Return Factor - 100%My social group, Fred's Playland traveled to the Mesa area to tube on the Salt river. We chose the Cracker Barrel for breakfast but never got the chance to sample the food. I made a reservation for a bus load of 42 people with Michael the manager. This reservation was made 3 weeks before our trip. Reservation was confirmed 3 days before our trip, and re-confirmed the day before our visit. I called with a 30 minute heads up and was told they had no room for us and we would have to get in line with our 42 people and wait for available tables. I asked for the manager and was put on forget not once but three times.Finally I went to plan B and called Golden Coral. They were more than happy to make space for our group and even gave us our own dining area and servers. I give a big thumbs down to Cracker Barrel. This type of custoomeer service is totally unacceptable. It would have been just as easy to say they didn't want our business to begin with. They not only disapointed a customer, they disapointed 42 in one shot. Lack of customer service only ends up with lack of customers.This is about the 10th time we have been here. So I cannot believe that I have never written  a review, so time's a wasting.Every time we have ever come here it has been really good. For starters Hot Tea and Ice Tea are only $1.99. That is a good price. Every where else we have gone lately it has been $3.00 or more.The food is really good!  Every single time. We ordered dinner and it was pretty busy being Friday night.Every thing was good and came out very fast. Steak was cooked perfecty and The Rainbow Trout was really good, it even still has the skin on it. So it was really moist.Prices are super great here and service is always good. The food is a lot , and it tastes great!We really like the little store in front as well. They already had the Halloween stuff out for sale. Halloween is only 3 months away.
Restaurant My Canh=A friend of mine took me here and recommended "Mi Lakay". It was really tasty egg noodles (make sure you ask for the so-called 'dried version'). The restaurant was quite small but cozy
Great Links Brewhouse & Grill=It had been many months since I ate a genuine Chicago Dog, and I had been craving one for a couple of days.  Finally, instead of fighting the urge any longer, I thought, "Why not?  Let's do it!"  Diane agreed, and just like that we detoured to Jones and Craig where my favorite LV Valley hot dog joint awaited.  It was all very spontaneous, and the anticipation of biting into the natural casing of an authentic Chi Town Dog was palpable.I smiled as I saw the familiar grinning hot dog reclining in a bun painted on a window next to the restaurant entrance, and felt like I was being personally greeted and welcomed back.  Inside, I contemplated if one dog was enough, and since it never was before, ordered a Kraut Dog to go with a Chicago beauty, plus an order of Natural Fries.  Diane selected a Cheese Dog and Cheese Fries.  And, we both asked for a glass of the very smooth and tasty Schrecher Draft Root Beer that is always on tap.When the food arrived quicker than I thought it would, my Chicago Dog looked like it was specially made to coincide with the Christmas season upon us.  Besides a juicy reddish all-beef Boar's Head hot dog in a natural casing that audibly snaps when bitten into, the soft and supple steamed poppy seed bun contained excellent tasting emerald-green relish, a bright red slice of fresh tomato, white diced onions, a green kosher dill pickle spear, two small yellow sport peppers, yellow mustard, and celery salt.  I did not besmirch this divine creation with ketchup, for which indiscretion Chicago natives would have undoubtedly chased me out of the windy city on a rail had I been there.  And, need I say that this hot dog tasted as good as it looked!  Well, it surely did, and was quickly dispatched.     Thank goodness I had the Kraut Dog waiting as a second course.  Spicy mustard is available but I chose mild yellow mustard, and the warm, white sauerkraut blanketing another all-beef dog had just the right amount of crunch and liquidity.  I gobbled up this more simply designed frank even faster than the Chicago cousin that preceded it.  All the while I enjoyed my generous helping of skin-on fresh Natural Fries.  They were just as good naked as doused with ketchup.  So, conflicted a bit on which way to go, at length I opted for half one way and half the other.Meanwhile Diane very much enjoyed her Cheese Dog with an all-beef dog ensconced in melted Cheddar Cheese, and Cheese Fries that were Natural Fries covered with a mild and warm Cheese Sauce.  They were very good; I know because I consumed a Cheese Sauce-laden fry myself for the sake of this review.  Ah, the sacrifices I sometimes make in the name of authentic reviewing!  The smooth draught root beer washed down everything quite well, and we left in very good spirits.Service by Michelle and the two grill cooks was friendly and efficient, and, despite fairly heavy traffic, the restaurant was clean and picked up quite well.  One moment after a diner left, I espied a white napkin that had fluttered to the floor.  When I looked again after jotting down this information, it was already gone.  The only negative item to report was so minor it is hardly worthy of mention.  The salt shaker on our table was out of salt.  I quickly snatched a filled one from an adjoining table without even having to get up from my seat, and this slight and very short inconvenience was resolved.Funny thing is though, I could go back tomorrow and repeat the process all over again.  After having had my taste buds stirred up once more, my craving for top-of-the-line hot dogs is not really diminished!Definitely five stars for great hot dogs, fries, and root beer!The Skinny: large selection of menu items, reasonable prices, phenom artisan root beer (4) service: efficient, friendly (4) value: pretty reasonable considering the quality (4).We were scouring around town to find a great place for hot dogs and so far fell short... until Great Links.The first time we ate here, we were literally overwhelmed by the selection here. I mean in addition to hot dogs, you have burgers, sammys, a selection various fried items smothered with a different toppings and salads. And for you vegetarians out there, they have a mighty fine selection of veggie kielbasa, bratwurst, italian sausage, hamburgers. I've never heard of veggie kielbasa, but I thought that was a pretty brilliant thing.Personally, being of the meat eating persuasion, I ordered myself a grilled chicken salad. Yeah boring I know. But honestly, my company was instituting this whole exercise/eat right initiative and I felt obligated to participate. (I have since fallen off the bandwagon.) Really at a place like this, I wasn't really expecting much because it is a burger/hot dog joint after all. I was surprised though. Although it's romaine, it's clearly freshly chopped (note, none of that early brownish tinge you get when it's been cut a long time ago) with other veggies.They have a very simple oil and vinegar dressing that hit the spot. Plus, the chicken was plentiful and moist. For less than $7, it's far superior to many grilled chicken salad in the same price range.The hubs couldn't help but try their artisan root beer. For us soda drinkers, it's got that real root beer-ish, herbacious flavouring (in an absolutely good way) that brought us back to the good ol' days. A must try!Not being on a company diet, the hubs has had the rueben, their KC Masterpiece Nascar special featuring Boarshead sausage, their italian sausage and side orders of their fried zucchini, regular shoestring fries and freshly cut french fries. Their reuben was pretty great while the KC Masterpiece Nascar special was a little overwhelming with all the cheese, BBQ sauce on it - it kind of detracted from the flavours of the sausage. Regardless, their plainer renditions fare better - the casings got a nice snap to it.The sides were a hit or miss. The fried zucchini's batter was a little too heavy and fell apart when you picked it up. Their fresh cut fries don't have quite the crispiness that I look for in a french fry. I prefer their shoestring fries which were much crispier and lighter -- FYI - their shoesting is more the size of your standard McDonald's french fries. Overall, given the price, I would definitely recommend this place for a good tuck in of hot dogs and root beer (4).I feel so silly to think I've already done a review for Great Links! I've been here so many times since they opened...I was going to update my review but it turns out, there was nothing to update! FAIL!They have good hotdogs here. They're fresh and you could hear the snap when you bite into one. I personally like to keep it simple and get the chili dog. Very flavorful and I don't like beans so this is perfect for me. The cheese is nice and melted. But I've also tried their Mob Boss Dog which has mozzarella sticks, peppers, onions, marinara, mushrooms and parmesan cheese.  It's a great hotdog when I'm not feeling so plain.The main reason I like this place is their Italian fries. One of my favorite fries in Vegas. Each fry is loaded with Parmesan and Italian spices. I don't like sharing mine so get your own!I remember John Curtas raving about their burgers but I still haven't deviated from their hotdogs.  One of these days, I'll give their burger a try...with a side of Italian fries of course!Yum, yum, yummy!  I'm in love with Great Links!We finally made it over to Great Links this weekend and I am kicking myself for making it out here sooner!  I have wasted many, many years of AMAZING edible delights by not coming to Great Links earlier.  At least I have seen the light and the error of my ways!We sampled the Streets of New York Dog (yum), the Ball Park Dog (classic), and a kraut dog (tasty), as well as the über-fantastic Italian tater tots.  The dogs were all amazing!  The have a great snap when you bite in to them, which is always a sign of a quality dog.  The toppings were all on point and in a decent amount for the dogs we ordered.  I think the kraut here is some of the best I have ever had.  EVER.  Now on to the the most fabulous tater tots I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  We tried the Italian tater tots on our server's recommendation.  We were going to do fries, but her told us the tater tots would stand up better to all of the sauce, so we went with it.  Oh my goodness, those things were tasty!  The garlic goodness was great and the Parmesan on top sent it over the moon.  We had them finished before I had finished my hot dog, so I used some of my bun to soak up the extra sauce and it was stay fantastic.  Yummmm!I can't wait to go back and try more dogs, sausages, burgers, and everything else they had on the huge menu.  I see this place becoming a very regular place for my family.All the hot dogs here are Boar's Head, but you can choose skinless or a turkey dog. Walking in there were several employees that greeted us. We chose a table near the window and started looking through the menu. The menu offers a variety of not just hot dogs, but also sausage, burgers, sandwiches, chicken, fish, and salad.  Given the name, I had to try a hot dog the first time! Priced at $4.59 I ordered the "Philly Griller dog" that had grilled peppers, onion and cheese sauce. Yum! I couldn't even eat the whole thing so half went to hubby who didn't care for the char taste, but I like a good charred dog. The peppers and onions had a great flavor and there was a fair amount of cheese sauce. I also had some "Italian Fries" priced at $4.29 and had my choice of shoestring or crinkle-cut. I chose the shoestring and it was tossed in a garlic butter sauce and topped with parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning. These were good! I asked for a side of ranch to dip them in and the ranch was good. Our server was nice and checked on us often. I do feel the restaurant could be cleaner inside, but there was a good vibe and I'd go back. You can place your order for pick-up as well.It's no Dog Haus*, but damn I was surprised by the dogs here! Large menu of hotdog and sausage options, along with kicked-up fries and tots, burgers, and even some chicken options. VEGAS CHILI DOG: Sage sausage white chili, pepper jack cheese, relish, tomatoes, cayenne sour cream, and spicy mustard. I don't think I've had white chili before, but I definitely dig it on hot dogs! This pick was loaded up and practically needed a fork to eat, great chili and good snap on the standard dog.MOB BOSS: Grilled onions, peppers, and mushrooms, with marinara sauce, tons of parm, and two cheese sticks. Get this with hot Italian sausage for the full effect. Again, covered in toppings and filling enough to be a meal. Great flavor in the sausage, too.Opted for standard tots as our side, and we were encouraged to try a dipping sauce- opted for the fry sauce and was not disappointed. Crisp, fresh-made tots and ample, lightly-spiced fry sauce. Good light side to balance out the heavy hotdogs.Signage indicates that they provide table service if you dine in, but we (and other visitors during our visit) used the walk-up and order method. Guys behind the counter were friendly.*Re: Dog Haus is a part butcher store, part hot dog restaurant in LA with truly gourmet concoctions. It's a few steps up from Great Links, but I can appreciate them both.I'm up in arms that it's taken me so long to try out Great Links Brewhouse & Grill. I really have no excuse. It's close to home, has great Yelp reviews, and even has veggie dogs on the menu. Come to find out not only do they have offer veggie hot dogs, they have a full blown vegetarian faux meat menu that includes veggie chili, brats, cheese steak, bacon, and chicken nuggets! Veggie items are priced the same as their meaty counterparts. I squealed in excitement and vowed to be a regular customer if the food was good. Ladies and gents, I was not disappointed. DELUXE CHILI CHEESE DOG ($5.49): Covered in vegetarian chili, cheddar cheese, and jalapeno slices (sans onions). A few slices of veggie bacon were tucked in the veggie hot dog. Tasted awesome, and I'm so glad to have an eatery that really caters to the vegetarian community. I only wish the cheese was more melt-y. 4/5LAS VEGAS CHILI DOG ($5.49): This dog comes with white chili and is an upgraded version to the traditional dog. Cayenne sour cream and pepper jack cheese were some of the unexpected ingredients. Husband liked it! 4/5ITALIAN FRIES ($4.29): Loaded with parmesan cheese. Not what I'm used to but we were happy with these fries. 4/5ZUCCHINI STYX ($4.99): These were just okay. Probably won't order them again. The zucchini was too squishy. 2/5VIBE: Small, casual hot dog joint. 4/5SERVICE: Upon walking in, we thought we were supposed to order at the counter but we were instructed to sit down at a table. Our waitress was super nice and checked in on us often. As we left the guys working behind the counter waved and bid us a friendly farewell. 4/5GOOD TO KNOW: They have a BOGO coupon in the Entertainment Book, up to $6. YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #240
Khyber Pass Restaurant=I didn't think I'd go all the way to Montreal to try Afghan food, but as it turned out we finally did get full of all the rich French food we had been eating and needed something different on our last night in town. This place had caught our eye several times as we had been walking to Au Pied de Cochon. It turned out great, as it was inexpensive and friendly, and the food was good. We all got one of the table d'hôte options for about $25, including soup, appetizer, main course, dessert, and coffee/tea. I started with the Mashaba soup, which included noodles, vegetables, ground beef, yogurt, and coriander. Very delicious. For my appetizer, I got the Ashak, which was small boiled pastas stuffed with chopped leek and served with mint yogurt and ground beef tomato sauce. This was good but a bit heavy after the soup; I preferred the pumpkin borani that my brother ordered (my husband got the eggplant borani but he wolfed it all down before I got the chance to try it myself). For my main course I got the Korma Chalaw, a trio of basmati rice served with lamb chunks cooked in tomato sauce. The lamb was nice and tender, but I was so full at this point. My brother got the Vegetarian Combo of spinach, cauliflower, gumbo, turnip, and eggplants, which I wish I had ordered instead. The dessert was rose water pudding sprinkled with pistachio nuts, which was excellent. I got coffee and my brother got a tasty cardamon tea. We loved all the flavors in the food, especially the strong presence of cardamon in everything. It was a BYOY (bring your own wine) place; we were a little wined out so we didn't bring any, but there is a SAQ just on the corner where you can pick up some wine to bring to dinner here. Overall a solid restaurant, we enjoyed it.
Arriba Mexican Grill=This may be the first review that I've awoken from a deep dream of peace to write.  Ok, first I had to make a pit stop, but then it was time to pen my thoughts and aspir... ooooh hoooold on, brb...Now, where was I.  Here's a fun fact... the human body can hold up to a quarter of its own weight in disposable fluids, whose liberation can be mobilized by Arriba's own spinach enchiladas.  Ole!That's right, the green leafy vegetable made famous by a marble-mouthed sailor, now compels me to blow my own ballast tanks... again and againBut I have to say, this couldn't have come at a better time, with tomorrow being the inaugurate outing of my office's hiking group.  Magic 8 Ball says "Signs point to yes" that I'll collapse 27 minutes into the trek from dehydration, and possibly require professional extrication.You know what doesn't require professional extrication?  The cauldron of dysentery brewing in my lower GI.  Spiiiicy!But to be fair, its not all waterloo, Arriba's.  I really should thank you for lightening my load, even though I've really never felt more bloated and irritated.  *quizzical look*And if I ever nurture the desire to tarry in your cantina, which is somewhat reminiscent of The Blue Oyster on tango night, I'll be sure not to waste the opportunity, and schedule that pesky colonoscopy for the following morning.  Osmoprep's got nutin on you, honey.Montezuma's revenge me once, shame on you.  Montezuma's revenge me twice... we wont get fooled again
One Eyed Dog=The service was good. It was clean. And it was very, Very, VERY full of a ton of really old people.  I haven't seen this many old people in the same place at once since my last trek to Sun City.But I didn't hold the old people factor against One Eyed Dog. I like old people. I had a minor in gerontology in undergrad.  It was just a little peculiar.  On a Friday night, I felt a little like I was sitting in a nursing home cafeteria.Then I noticed that this place was supposed to be a British pub.  And their decorations seemed a bit, um, TGIBritain.  But I'm no expert on what is an authentic British look, so I didn't hold that against them either.But the food was unimpressive.  I wasn't really hungry, and I joined my guests late, so I just sampled what my husband ordered.  The wings were peculiar.  I wasn't there when he ordered, but I'm sure that he asked for the wings to be crispy.  This is the first time that I ever had wings that were too crispy.  They were dessicated.  And the sauce was adequately hot, but too vinegary, and with a peculiarly flavored vinegar.  Maybe they used malted vinegar?  I've never tasted an octogenarian, but I imagine this is what they might taste like.The few fries I tasted were like frozen french fries that I could easily make at home.  Our friend ordered the fish fry sandwich, Walleye, which he seemed pleased with.  The waitress told us that the fish fry dinner was even better with the sides.  I'll take her word for it, she was very nice and efficient.It's near our friend's place, so if he suggested it again, I wouldn't say no and I would definitely stick with the fish fry dinner.  But I won't be rushing back.
Jardin Nelson=A couple of my friends and I were at Old port on Canada's day and were looking for a place to eat for dinner before the fireworks. As we were outside reading the menu, a local came up to us and told us that of all the places around here, this is the place to go, and prices are reasonable. So we went in and were pleasantly surprised :)In the garden area, is a wonderful terrace with large flower-like umbrellas, lots of beautiful flowers and brick walls. There's also a live jazz band. Lots of great choices on the menu, but I decided to go safe and choose a salad, because it was hot out and i haven't had fruits in a couple of days. I chose la salade estivale, which came to about $18 after tax. It has a variety of fruits, cubes of feta, pork filet and two sauces. I didn't like the sauces. But i must say, the pork is extremely TENDER, and packed with flavour! I was surprised it's even pork.Nachos were huge, i think they were soggy by the time you get half way. The goat cheese pastry appetizer is comfort food.If you are getting dessert, you must get the biscuit géant/the giant cookie! Served on a cast iron skillet, it's a soft dough with ice cream on top. The crunch from the pecans gives it a great contrast. It's a treat worth eating the whole thing to yourself.With the bill, comes with a rate-us-on-how-we-did card, which i appreciated. I like places who care about their service, food and how to make the customer's experience better. You know a business cares about improving when they are open to suggestions.The environment is absolutely relaxing and entertaining and I'd like to try their french onion soup next time!
Bad Daddy's Burger Bar - Dilworth=Apparently there are a lot of people who like Big Daddy's, and I can't say that I completely blame them.  There is a lot to like.  Unfortunately, there is also plenty not to like about the place.Start with the waiting.  We all know, thanks to Tom Petty, that the waiting is the hardest part, and the best I can say about Big Daddy's is that it comes in stages.First you wait for a place to park.  There is a small lot directly behind the restaurant, but it appears to almost always be packed.  There is also another lot somewhat adjacent and across the street, but it's tough to see, especially after dark, and there are other lots up East Boulevard that explicitly say not to park there for Big Daddy's, so be careful where you decide to park.  Also keep an eye out for morons saving spaces for friends because they are going to stand in the spot and not pay attention to you as you pull in/out.  That's how adamant they are that they are going to get that spot.  Alternative, just run them over.  Maybe it will help get rid of them.Next you're going to have to wait for your table.  They do have those light up pager thingamabobs, so you don't have to wait for them to call your name (and hope that you hear it), but you'll still have to wait until yours lights up, and then make your way back to the front and everything.  I'd suggest grabbing a menu and looking it over - especially if you have kids and/or a family that can't decide easily because the menu is huge and it'll take some time.  Use it wisely.For some good news, once you sit down, the service is pretty decent for a while.  You'll see a server, and you will probably get some drinks fairly rapidly.  You may even be able to place your order (assuming you were able to decide what you wanted).  Just make sure you don't take too long, because the servers do have a tendency to disappear for long stretches.  Also make sure you don't mind loud noises of any sort, because there is a constant buzz in the place and there is also a tendency for large families to send that buzz up a few notches when kids who have been waiting push each other over the edge.Once you have managed to place your order, you get to wait again.  Not sure why, really, except that they are just slow perhaps.  But with everyone waiting, maybe it's just that the staff didn't want to feel left out, so now they get to take their turn.  Unfortunately it's the kitchen staff (as in delivering your food to the servers) or perhaps the servers (as in the food sits and waits for them to deliver to you) and in the meantime your drinks often run dry (so maybe the cooks are fine and it's just the servers).Eventually you will get your food - though you may not have any drinks to go with it - and you'll find that in a few bites your burger will be gone.  As has been mentioned elsewhere, these are some pricey meals, and though they are reasonably tasty, they are probably not worth it.  We tried a pretty good variety of meals, from the standard burger (with bacon and cheese added) to the mama ricotta (italian) burger to the western (buffalo) burger and the cantina 1511 (black bean) burger, and while good, they were gone quickly.The starches - regular fries, sweet potato fries and tater tots - were all quite good (the tater tots were actually the best and crispiest), and the sauces that came with them were good as well.  It's just too much waiting for not enough food that really wasn't that great.After hearing such amazing rants and reviews about how utterly amazing this place was, I finally took a stab at it. I don't know what it is about expectations, but when the bar is set above and beyond reach, expectations transcend into a delusional dream; a state of nirvana that's almost unreachable and rarely lived up to. For me personally, it sets off a trigger that causes me to excessively critical. I think Megan C put it best, I should have gone in with zero expectations. The burgers are eclectic and designed with ingenuity. They're made with high quality ingredients and a good list of add-ons are also offered. For a noob, deciding on the right burger was a pretty daunting task. They all sounded incredibly tasty, but I ended up opting for the bacon cheeseburger on 'Roids. Choosing a complimenting beer was just as hard, but in the end, I ended up shaking hands with Rogue's ever so familiar Dead Guy. Being it was my first visit, no subs; I wanted to try the burger exactly as they intended. This bad boy is huge. The patty was good, great quality and cooked to order (medium), but a tad too cold in the center. Bacon: good bacon, but with the sprinkling of bacon salt, the overall burger became too salty and I had to pick out some bacon bits. Layering: The order in which the ingredients are stacked makes a big difference and is of the utmost importance. The bottom ingredient is the first thing you taste, the first thing to tickle the taste buds. I prefer the cheese on bottom, and in this case, the veggies were on the bottom. Double tomato, pickles, lettuce etc. Bad idea, 'cause all it did was make the bottom bun soggy. With a massively messy burger of this magnitude, I had trouble keeping it all together. The lil' lady had the western burger and I took liberty in sampling it, of course. Actually, more like gorging. While it was also good, I can't really say it was memorable. Sweet potato fries are good, but same consensus - nothing memorable and nothing you can't get anywhere else. The chips though, I really liked. Much more crispier than other places. Overall, while my burger was good, I think the price tag it came with was more memorable than the actual burger itself. I won't write it off though, I actually do like Big Daddy's. I also appreciate and respect what they're doing. It's a pretty hip spot that I would frequent and show off to others. I think I'll just need to give them a few more attempts to satisfy my uberly critical palate before the stars start shining. Hey, we're all critics in our own rights, right? =)Burger #190: In Good CompanyThank god I was surrounded by health care professionals when I ate that burger. With a 99% chance of a heart attack, they would have had only a few minutes to prep me for an organ donation after my cardiac death. Lucky for me, that burger didn't kill me and I was able to conquer it. When out with clients, I typically try not to do anything too "Eli" like. But when the menu said "Bacon Cheese Burger on Steroids" and promised six strips of bacon with bacon salt and baconnaise, I couldn't help myself. Since I was already going to hell for ordering that meaty death on a plate, I upped the ante by adding a fried egg to the gluttonous pile. Behold;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yWUBX9Pe6pzh1PjVj04UmQ?select=g17yyWNzeNH8tx3llO2xZQIt was everything I had hoped for; meaty, rich, baconny, juicy, packed with flavor, and overly sinful. The six strips of bacon all melded together into a rich decadent topping that was only enhanced by the runny egg yolk. The mild jack cheese did its part by adding a smooth texture and another fatty element to the mix. The bun was perfect; unobtrusive and sturdy enough to withstand the burger's might. The only thing keeping the burger from perfection was that it came a tad overcooked, other than that it was great. The coup de gras (pun intended) were the tater tots. They were some of the best I've ever had. Crisp, salty, and delicious. They were just what I needed to help wash down the insanity that was my burger.Cheeseburger cheeseburger coronary coronary. I chose the Nick's Patty Melt which was a fab slab of meat on rye toast with grilled onions and a side of great shoestring fries. Not the healthiest choice (people come here for salads??) but it was massively delicious and filling.Decent beer specials and a few local choices on their menu.Parking at lunch time is a major challenge. All I can say is "Good luck."Ahhhmazing. Like seriously. Why is this place so good?We stopped in on Sunday for lunch. The parking lot was packed and we knew we'd made a good choice but no clue we'd literally just hit the jackpot on Burger Bars in Charlotte! This is my kind of place....tons of burger options with your choice of fries or tots. Oh yes, sign me up every time. We started with an order of the buffalo wings. Shut up. They came out pipping hot....literally right out the pan. We got both ranch and blue cheese (what!?) and enjoyed every bite! They aren't too spicy but have a great amount of flavor. I'd recommend them and absolutely order them again. For burgers, Derrick tried the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids and I opted for the Cantina. Soooo me being jealous that his burger came with 6 pieces of bacon (Mmmm....bacon) I added jalapeno bacon and jalapenos to mine. These really are some of the best burgers in town. It's like a flavor explosion in your mouth with each bite. Not joking...they are that good. Guys, seriously. This is how a burger should be....stacked up with toppings so big you can barely get your mouth open enough for a good bite! Yums. Add to that tots and fries and you might as well just consider the rest of your day a bust....because you will need a nice long nap!
Harem Lounge=30 seconds in this posh place, and I was already excited. They had a coffee bar, the most awesome assortment of bottled beverages I've seen in ANY hookah bar, and the atmosphere--oh my, is it lavish.It was a trap! $15 for a one hose hookah ties the priciest I've ever paid. Wait, what's that? It's $20 just because it's a Saturday night? Now you're pushing it. Well, at least I can split the cost with my friends. Four people to a hookah will be alright, I suppose. A cover charge, you say? Five dollars for each of my friends who didn't order a hookah? Alright, now we're up to $35 for four of us to share a one hose.But the nickel-and-diming doesn't end there. You'll also be required to purchase a drink. No hard feelings about the drink itself--the introduction to sparkling Voss ($4) was welcome. But to pay for that after the cover...isn't that a little extreme for a hookah bar?After shelling out what felt like a ripoff, I was still ready to have my mind blown by this place. Too bad I didn't even get to sit on the second floor! I asked, and received no reason why it couldn't be done when my party was the only one in the building. If you ever have the misfortune of coming here, you'll see why that's a big deal--the second floor is the coolest little balcony you'll ever see at at a hookah bar.So I finally get the hookah. It looked like an expensive piece, but I was displeased to see instant light coals (low quality) sitting on top. I huffed and I puffed, but could barely muster one iota of smoke. After sucking ash, I complained to the waitress, who was almost clueless about what to do.15 minutes later, I got my hookah back. It smoked alright...too bad they used the cheapest shisha. Why charge so much when you use such a low quality product? I can barely even call Harem a hookah bar. I think that's just a front. It's a place to sip coffee and Voss in style, that just happens to serve subpar hookahs on the side. It's the most expensive place of its kind, yet has the worst quality I have ever encountered. One star is too much, and I may never go again...unless they let me smoke on the second floor.I write this review with sadness in my heart.  I have been coming to Harem since it was Coffee Society and before they started serving Hookahs.There are no locks on the bathroom.  Embarassing when a drunk from Ra walks into the bathroom and takes a couple minutes to figure out you arent a toilet.No soap in the bathrooms.  I need to clarify this - the last 3 times I have been there, no soap in the bathrooms.The coffee is still great, the hot chocolate was awesome, the hookah was great... but Ive been coming here for over 10 years.  I can see the decline.Buy soap, put locks on the bathrooms, and bring back the good shisha you used to serve up.=(Okay so I am a total hypocrite by giving this place one star considering the fact that I have been here more than once.Anyways, FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE....Located next to RA, which is pretty busy like all day, surprisingly, this place is never busy(but I personally love empty hookah lounges). The lounge is very attractive. This place appears to be very upscale. There is a full bar and the menus light up which is pretty neat. There is also an upstairs and outside seating area.The MAJOR downfalls about this place are that there is usually just one person working. It's the same guy that's been in there everytime I went. He is very inconsistent on checking on you to see if you need more coals or not. He actually isn't even in the front half of the time. Everytime I got a hookah, it has always been harsh. EVERYTIME.Also, the prices are "go f*ck yourself" ridiculous. Extremely high for what you get. The shisha isn't a very good quality in general and to have the audacity to charge $30.00 for a single one hose, this is unacceptable under all circumstances. YA YOU'RE A NICE LOOKING LOUNGE BUT...if you give me halfass hookah, how am I supposed to enjoy myself? Why did I come here again since I had such a bad experience?...well, it's convient to me and I'm too lazy to travel.If you are a regular hookah smoker, or just in the mood to smoke, you're better off traveling the extra 10 minutes to Tempe.
The Art Of Soup=A friend of mine tipped me off to this place and being a soup- lover, I had to try it. The selection is minimal- 3 soups per day at the moment. Today's selection was chilled zucchini, real chicken noodle, and Caribbean black bean. I opted for the black bean, and I was not disappointed. The beans were perfect- not mushy like some bean soups can be. The flavors were all very distinct but blended together perfectly. Yum. The soups come in different sizes, with an 8 oz. bowl for $5.25. (that would be the small size) Saltines, lavosh or bread (from Simply Bread) with olive oil or butter come on the side. Everything is organic, and extremely fresh. No cans here. Beverage options include a few different bottled waters, a selection of hot or iced teas, and seasonal smoothies. A BYOB liquor license is in the works. The dining area is sparse, with three tables, but it seemed like quite a bit of business was done for take-out orders. As an FYI- they take orders for soup pick-up, and will even arrange to be there if you want to come after work. Pretty cool, considering they're currently open from 10-2. I would love to see a bigger selection of soup, but the place is only a few weeks old and the owner assures me that there is much more to come. I can't wait to find out what it is.When my co-workers both had that blah feeling today, I decided we should try The Art of Soup. I had heard about from Amanda B. (thanks Amanda!) at a recent Yelp event, and had I not known where to find it, I probably wouldn't have found it!The three soups being served today were an Asian Mushroom, Chicken with Spinach, and a Persian Yogurt soup. Jacquelyn had the Mushroom. Erin had the Chicken. I was the super-star who had ALL THREE!No, I'm not a big piggy - I had a flight of soup! Instead of one 8oz cup/bowl of soup, I had three 4oz cups of soup, so I got to try each one. My favorite was the mushroom, but each was fantastic. The mushroom soup was today's vegan option, and it was incredibly flavorful without being over seasoned or salty. The mushrooms were the perfect consistency .... Yum!What I loved most about getting the flight was I tend to get bored of soup. I have a few slurps and then it just gets old. However, with the flights, right when I was feeling done with one taste, I had an entirely different taste waiting for me.  And, I honestly would have never selected the Persian Yogurt soup, but I was glad I got to try it. It was very refreshing (I saved it for last), especially on a hot day. The combination of dill and mint was fragrant and fresh, while the sweetness of the raisins complemented the bitterness of the radishes and walnuts sprinkled on top.  Janet, the owner, told me all about where the recipe for the Persian Yogurt soup came from, and she also shared with us that all of the ingredients wer purchased at the farmer's market that very morning. For dessert, we indulged in amazing chocolate chip cookies from Urban Cookies .... Yum ..... But perhaps that's another review!
Le Cartet=Le Cartet a été un de nos premiers arrêts lors d'une visite guidée pour des invités venant de l'Autsralie. Nous y sommes allé pour le brunch et en sommes resortis rassasiés et satisfaits.J'étais avec trois gars qui ont tous pris le Brunch des cantons, Un délice pour ceux qui aiment la viande, et une occasion parfaite découvrir les cretons et fèves aux lards à des étrangers.Pour ma part, le brouillé aux asperges et cheddar servi sur une toast géante était très bien. Les fruits en accompagnement étaient aussi très bon, et non de simples garnitures pour rendre l'assiette jolie.J'y retourne c'est granati.Pendant des années, je travaillais dans le coin et, pendant des années, j'y ai mangé leurs repas et sandwichs prêts-à-manger sur l'heure du lunch. C'était aussi, d'ailleurs, mon café de facto en rentrant au travail le matin. Sans flincher, c'est probablement un des restos les plus fiables. La qualité de leurs produits est toujours des plus élevées, l'accueil en restaurant et au comptoir est toujours à la hauteur et les prix sont quand même abordables pour le Vieux-Montréal. Bonnes salades, excellents sandwichs sur pain au levain maison, délicieux plats chauds pour emporter, excellente variété de boissons et superbe sélection de sucreries et chocolats locaux.I went here for lunch the other day. I had the salmon sandwhich and my boyfriend had the ham and cheese on a baguette. One word- amazing. Fish tasted fresh and portions just right. We had the pecan whiskey pie to top things off...and wow....heaven on earth. Our waitress was friendly and I got to practice my french with her. Its been two days and I can't stop thinking about the pie!
Hougan's Racing Sandwich Shop=After reading all of the great reviews of this place, I was really really hoping for a great sandwich experience.  I don't live anywhere near this place but happened to be in the neighborhood yesterday, so I decided to make a stop here.I ordered a Regular Sized (9") Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich with Provolone & Peppers.The woman working there was very nice and friendly.  The other customers in the joint appeared to be regulars because she knew them by name and already knew what a few of them wanted......very impressive.  You don't find service like that too often in Vegas.My sandwich was very fresh & hot and looked awesome.  However, in the taste department it fell flat for me.  I thought the Beef was a little bland.....it didn't have that distinctive taste that I expect from a Steak Sandwich.  I also thought it could have used more Cheese as I could barely taste the Provolone.  The Peppers were good.....although, I didn't know you had the option to order Sweet or Hot Peppers until I overheard other people asking for them.....wish I would have known, I would have ordered Hot......to be fair, it's printed on the menu on the wall.....but I overlooked it as I was trying to read everything and figure out what to order before someone else came in and cut in front of me.Overall, it was a pleasant experience and even though the Steak Sandwich didn't do it for me, I will give this place another try the next time I'm in the area so I can try the Pastrami & Swiss Burger and their Italian Sandwich.  Until then, it gets 3 Stars in my book.
Pio Pio=After living in Northern Virginia for 8 years and having Peruvian rotisserie chicken for lunch about once every 2 weeks, I can safely say that it is one of my favorite comfort foods.  The skin is perfectly crispy, the meat moist and delicate, and the spices just enough to kick up the natural flavor of the bird.  Add in a plate full of yuca and beans, maybe a beef empanada to start, and a cold beer.  Heaven.Pio Pio nails it.  The food here is delicious, the service quick and friendly, and the location perfectly close to my house.  I can't say how excited I am to find good roasted chicken in my neighborhood.  The best part?  A quarter chicken is $3.50.  Yes, you read that right.Now, if only North Carolina would ease up on their draconian liquor laws and allow Pio Pio to serve real Peruvian and Colombian beer.Chicky chicky bok bok, chicky chicky. Oh how I love me some roasted chicken. Pio Pio is a clean restaurant with great staff and excellent portions. While rotisserie chicken is good no matter how it's prepared, there wasn't a distinct "Peruvian" flavor. Maybe I'm ignorant (don't answer that please), but  it just tasted like any other roasted chicken with herbs and spices. Good nonetheless. Sweet plaintains; well they're plantians no matter how you slice em. Fried yucca was just that, yummy in my tummy fried yucca. Rice and beans were solid but what Pio Pio does best are the dipping sauces. I don't know how to describe them but I'm guessing one is a vinegar based garlic cream sauce and the second I can't even put my finger on. To be honest, I don't really care, it was good that's all I know. It's like going to a foreign country or eating foreign food. If it looks like grasshopper, crunches like grasshopper, well it just might be grasshopper! Don't ask, don't tell, just eat it if it's yummy!yayy for AUTHENTIC Colombian and Peruvian food! They specialize in rotisserie chicken, which is what I normally get, but the other dishes I've tried were also delectable. Normally, I'm afraid to try a different dish at any restaurant because I always end up liking what other people ordered or what I ordered previously more. Luckily, this place never fails me! EVERYTHING MUST BE GOOD! Every dish is unique and original because they make all of their spices and sauces in-house, The portions are huge and I think most of their dishes come with rice and plantain. This is by far the BEST rotisserie chicken I have ever had! The plantain is also amazing. There are 2 kinds, the ripe, sweet plantain and the fried, green plantain. It depends on your preference, but both are delicious! The restaurant's interior has a very cultural, homey vibe. The walls are decorated with beautiful paintings, in combination with warm lighting. It is a family-owned restaurant and you definitely get that cozy feel. Definitely try this place out if you're in the area!DISCRIMINATION AT PIO PIO.PIO PIO WAITER BANNED ME, MY PREGNANT WIFE AND 3 KIDS FROM THE  RESTAURANT FOR ASKING THEM TO BE MORE ATTENTIVE TO US.I really like the food here but the service is the absolute worst.  The waiters definitely tend to the non-minority patrons before the minority customers and treat them better.  Guess what I am? Yep, you guessed it,  a minority. On one trip to Pio Pio, the really skinny, delicate looking guy/girl (I'm not sure) waiter with the overly plucked eyebrows forgot 2 of my kids's kids meals.  Maybe it was because we ordered so many dishes that they got confused and it just got lost in the shuffle.  Good thing we ordered so much because my kids ate plenty and their dishes were not missed but we kept looking out for their meals to arrive during the entire meal.  We figured they never placed the order but when we received the check we were billed for it.  I had them remove the charge but they had this look on their faces like we ate the meal and were trying to get a freebie (2 kid meals for $4 bucks each or so). I let it slide and left a full 20 % tip because we still had a great meal and lots of fun.On subsequent visits the service was typically and terribly slow but on my last visit I was forced to let them know how unacceptable their service towards us was.  We sat outside, which was a big mistake because since we were not in their immediate line of sight and vicinity, they seemed to have lost track of us.  They were painfully slow to take our orders, serve our drinks, bring out our food, and fill our waters.  We ordered an additional rice and beans side dish during the course of the meal and waited 30 minutes for it to arrive when we were already done with the meal.  We asked for more water and the head waiter/head bus boy/manager agreed.  15 minutes later he passed by to tend to the table next to us and I asked him for water.  He said okay.  15 more minutes he passed by again empty handed and I asked for a water refill.  He angrily said he will get to it and that they were busy.  I asked a passing waitress for the bill which she got to us about 20 minutes later.  It took another 15 minutes for them to pick up the credit card that I was going to pay the bill with.  15 minutes later when she finally brought the credit card slip back for me to sign I still had not gotten a water refill and my pregnant wife was really thirsty and irritated.  No one came to check on us and I wrote a note at the bottom of the credit card slip letting them know that we are regulars that have spent thousands of dollars at the restaurant and have been continually given poor customer service.  I let them know that this was not right and needed to change.  I did not leave a tip which they did not deserve, which is not usually smart if you are a return customer because they will undoubtedly spit in your food the next time you come.I returned 3 months later with my even-more-pregnant wife, my 3 kids and a head teacher of the local school who became a big fan after we introduced her to the food.  She has since turned 8 of her friends onto it as well.  As I walked towards the restaurant, I told my teacher friend that I had serious issues with the service at Pio Pio but the food is too damn good to deny. Little did I know I was about to be denied.When I walked through the door we were greeted by the skinny overly-plucked eyebrow person.  He walked past me and spoke to my wife with a big smile in spanish and basically told her the owner said we were banned from the restaurant for what we did the last time we were there. What? You mean tell you guys to treat us better? I asked to speak with the owner and was told he was not there.  We went back and forth for a minute or so and decided not to beg to eat there and we left.  He felt pretty good about kicking us out because he/she had a big old smile on his face. I decided we would handle the issue with the owner directly.My wife called the restaurant asking to speak with the owner, who we've actually met and spoken with on several occasions.  He's a fellow New Yorker and was super cool when we met.  The head waiter/head busboy/manager guy who wouldn't refill our waters on our last visit answered the phone and said the owner will stand by what they said.  He then said if we have so many problems with the restaurant then why do we go back.  We did not call to speak with this idiot so we did not bother to explain.  Dear Pio Pio owner- your waiters are horrible.  Today they kicked out 3 kids, a 7-month pregnant woman, a head elementary school teacher and me- all because we let them know that they need to step up their customer service.  You have lost our business and hard earned money.  You have lost our teacher friend's business.  You have lost her 8 friends' business.  All because of your waiters that don't treat minorities as equals.Salad eaters--listen up. I just devoured this salad for lunch and I have a feeling it's going to be in my regular salad rotation. A large portion of lettuce with shredded rotisserie chicken, generous amount of avocado, and the world's best salad dressing. A simple yet incredibly delicious salad. It comes with fries on the menu, but I recommend ordering plantains instead and tossing a few in! Super yum.The Pollo Loco of Charlotte? Maybe. :) BEST CHICKEN SOUP!This is our go-to healthy meal when we order lunch for everyone at the office. We always get 2 latin combos and 2 chicken soups.The chicken is rotisserie, very juicy and the salad is really fresh. Yummy Plantains, Yummy Yucca, Good rice and beans too. The chimichurri sauce will kick your butt though - dont eat that. The green sauce is also pretty hot - the white sauce is super yummy - get extra of that and use it on the salad - thats my jam!I skip the rice and the beans usually - and never feel guilty about eating the yummy chicken, salad and plantains. :)In the ongoing intergalactic battle of Peruvian rotisserie chicken , Pio Pio edges out Viva Chicken!Pull in to the parking lot as if you were going to Outback Steak House and head towards the strip mall at the back.For around $26, the Latin Combo Meal is the way to go. A full roasted chicken, yucca fries, plantains, rice and beans and a large salad with fresh avocados and flavorful dressing. Spice lovers will appreciate the "green sauce"; it's cream based, yet hotter than fire. Drench some Arepas in this sauce = so good! The Tostones are a delicious appetizer, especially when you pair it with guacamole. The chicken here is super juicy, everything is well seasoned and you will leave full!
El Ranchero Mexican Grill=This is one of my very favorite places in the valley. Their food is fantastic! No one in my family has had a bad meal in the place and neither have the friends I've brought.Now, I could list all the different things I've tried but that would take a while and, well, what would be the point? Between us, we've tried just about everything. The shrimp dishes are yummy because they cook the shrimp just right, it's not overdone like so many places in the desert. The chicken is delicious and the beef and pork are really good, too. Oh, and my daughter loves the tamales. My favorite thing is the chicken chimichanga. While the place isn't five stars on the atmosphere, nobody goes there for that. They go for amazing food at bargain prices. It's just a pleasure to support a local guy starting a family, eat the great food and walk out with your wallet intact.
Lakeside Bar & Grill=There's not many places to go out to eat in the far northwest valley.  My wife and I have stopped in three times hoping for a mediocre meal and passable service just so we don't have to drive 25 miles to find a dinner when we don't feel like cooking.Lakeside is just plain bad.  They serve a variety of foods and are good at preparing none of them.  Sandwiches are on crunchy, burnt (stale?) bread with too little, poor quality meat.  Italian dishes have soggy pasta with flavorless sauces, I've tasted better from a jar - which is obviously where they get theirs.Each time we've been in to try out their not fresh, bland food the restaurant was about 1/3rd full and it took nearly two hours from being seated immediately to getting a check.  We ordered 1 drink each, 1 main and no appetizer or dessert ... I think they have the world's slowest microwaves because that's where the food tastes like it came from, why the wait?AVOID this place at all costs.  I've never been treated so disrespectful in my entire life. Came here last night with 3 friends after having dinner at Squid Ink since it's the only bar in the area.  Ordered a beer for myself and 2 of my friends and was promptly told that in order to get the drinks I would need to surrender my keys.  Ok... I told them and I gave them my keys even though I didn't even bring my car here.  My friends and I ordered shots, then went on the dance floor and goofed around having a good time.  When I went to order another drink I was told by the waitress that I was "too drunk."  "Excuse me?" I asked her, "I've had 2 drinks!"  When I asked for my keys back she just flatly told me, "No." I went to find a manager and a burly doorman asked me what was my "problem." I told him my problem was I was being refused service and I just wanted to get my keys and get out of this crappy bar.  He told me I would get my keys as soon as a cab got here. I told him a cab was on the way, and that never in my life had I been treated like a common criminal for doing nothing wrong!  I told him obviously you people don't want my business and I won't ever return.  That's when the doorman told me, "That's fine, fags like you aren't welcome here." That's when I completely lost my shit.  After the cab arrived I asked for my keys back. I was told, "you're just planning on taking the cab to your car." I told him my car was at home and I needed my keys to get into my house! He finally thew the keys at me and I got the heck out of there.I have no idea where the people come off treating someone like that.  I did nothing wrong and was called a hateful word and was treated like a common criminal. And my tab came to around $25 for 3 beers. Definitely avoid this place.You know, sometimes you just forget where you bought that pair of slacks that fits so good.  And sometimes you forget what an awful experience you had at a restaurant last time.That's us...so fourth time is a never, ever again.  NEVER!Friday night...fish and chips.  We love fish and chips!NEVER, ever again.Needing one last drink on a Friday night, we grabbed a table...and waited, and waited.  For fifteen minutes we were completely ignored.  We saw waitresses walk back and forth, but by that time (11:30 PM), they were more interested in hanging at tables talking with friends than picking up any new business, even though they were supposed to be open til 2 AM.  Not all was lost - I was still able to enjoy some semi decent tunes before we got the picture and left.  But not early enough to avoid the x rated entertainment.  Apparently some drunk chick mistook a table and chairs as a mattress and some pillows and thought the thing to do was dry hump and try to undress her date.  And she wasn't cute.  Ick.My family and I have been here a few times. I have never had a good experience, but for some reason we continue to spend our dinners at Lakeside. I guess you call it Applebee's syndrome; you know it is nasty but you keep coming back. After last night, however, I will never be back. We went for "Wacky Wednesday" which promoted $5 specials. The prices are $6. The portions are so pathetic that I am sure this little promo works out in the restaurant's favor. Less food for more money!We also ordered the chips and salsa which provided us with a mentally stimulating family discussion: do you taste mold or disinfectant? We never came to a conclusion because we had our waitress take it away as quickly as possible. They were unable to bring us more because the entire batch tasted like that. Homemade salsa my ass.So Lakeside, you can keep your false promotions, horrible portions, and disgusting salsa.Good thing the service isn't too horrible or you'd really be in trouble.
Chez Monieux=Accidentally found this place. We were totally on the way to the Thai place on the same plaza when Chez Monieux appeared. Cajun food? Hummmm... My friend said he had Thai but have not had Cajun and that sealed the deal. So, we go inside and place is totally empty. I mean no one is there. WOW What the?!? But no matter, we were quickly greeted and seated at the table of our picking. Chit-chat with the guy and turns out they are like super new. Just opened up and not many people even know about them, and today supposedly weirdly slow anyhow. Ok cool, better for us!!We order up 2 platters and it shows up real quick. They even split it for us as we asked, so we can easily try each other orders. And try we did! It was GOOD! I mean, really REALLY good stuff. And it was lots of it. Did i mention it was good? In fact, my buddy could not stop eating it even though her kept on saying -"I can not stuff anything else in!" But its simply too hard to pull yourself from it.I do not give rave reviews very often, but this is totally one of them. You should absolutely check it out, its worth it. Yes, it might be in the little plaza next to the freeway and ambiance might be all but non-existent. But who cares?!? Go for food. You will not be disappointed!PS: Went there a little while ago again with thy wife. She liked it as well. They now have full bar and about 6 beers on tap, including one from New Orleans (Raspberry one, real refreshing.)"I like""Very nice"I checked this place out based on reviews on Yelp. My husband is orginally from Louisiana so he is always looking to get some food from home. Upon entering we were greeted right away and told to sit where ever we liked. I was pleased they had Abita Purple Haze on tap. Abita is a beer brewed in Louisiana. Right away, off to a good start.We ordered the boudin balls as an app and they were very delicious. For our entrees I ordered the fried green tomato po boy and my husband ordered the crawfish etoufee. Everything was very good. I will definitely go back. The owner (at least I think he was the owner) talked with us and was a real friendly guy.I really hope this place does well. It is in kind of a bad spot. Unless you know it's there you would probably just pass it up.Thanks to Yelp, my BFF found this place by typing "vegan".  I'm so glad she did, it was VERY GOOD!While we were ordering our drinks, Turbo Dog for me and Purple Haze for my cohort, the obviously Louisiana-born chef came out and asked if we had ever been there before.  I'm glad he did, because my friend is a pretty hard-core vegan and she wanted to know all of the details.  Stinky's Vegan Gumbo is not automatically vegan.  The veggie chicken isn't but the veggie sausage is, and the side of potato salad isn't, but they can substitute black-eyed peas which are. So she ordered the Stinky Gumbo without chicken, and substituted black-eyed peas for the side, which normally costs $1 extra, but the chef said we could do it, so the waitress waived the extra fee.Whew!  It was a bit of work, but my friend was very happy to get exactly what she was expecting, and the chef was incredibly knowledgeable and courteous about her questions.  Apparently he was vegan for a bunch of years, vegetarian for a bunch more, and now just has the occasional meat to check out the quality in the restaurant. Perfect!  He even mentioned that he was trying to find a source for vegan chicken so that eventually there would be no substitutions necessary.In our group we additionally ordered the seafood gumbo, chicken and sausage gumbo, chicken fricasee and hush puppies.  I'm no expert on what is authentic Cajun cuisine, but I do know what I like, and I liked my food a lot.  Everyone else in the group was equally pleased with their dishes.My big bowl of chicken and sausage gumbo (which I've never had before) was full of chicken, andouille sausage and okra in a spicy soup base with rice.  The okra wasn't even slightly slimy, which was what I was expecting after years of hearing about this much maligned vegetable.  The black-eyed peas were equally spiced and delicious.  My husbands fricasee was a chicken and potato stew with rice and had a slower, but equally significant amount of heat.  There was a poker tournament going on, so we were really the only diners at the time.  I'm sure that accounts for the level of attention we received from the chef, but it was definitely appreciated.  He came out after we had a chance to sample our meals to make sure that we were happy, and we were.  He also let us know about other social events that he would bring to the location: a variety of bands from metal to country as well as poker tournaments and the like.The beer was awesome too.  The two brews that my cohort ordered, TurboDog and Purple Haze are both made in Louisiana.  TurboDog is frighteningly dark-looking, without the heavy dark beer taste, think Amberbock if it was actually a good beer.  The Purple Haze is a lighter beer with a slightly peculiar aftertaste, but I only had a sip so I'm not sure what a whole glass would taste like.The menu contained 3-4 other entrees that I would love to go back and try.  I can't wait to go back!
Verses Restaurant=Whatever you do, don't order a dirty martini.Definitely a Lost In Translation moment at this cute little cafe. When ordering a vodka martini with extra olives, I expect a cocktail served "up" with a toothpick of extra green garnishment. Not the case. This was quite possibly the most unique martini I've ever had. Read the menu more closely and it's really a vodka-laden white sangria. And they added a layer of chopped up olive bits at the bottom, per my request. No wonder our server gave me a strange look when ordering.The first two gulps were tolerable, but as the salty met the sweet, it wasn't good. The house sangria in a pitcher is way better!
Subway=Subway is a royal piece of shit!! They pretent to be healthy but they use trans fat in all of their food. Butter and natural vegetable oil is metabolizable. I cant believe they wont do the right thing and take it out of thier food. It is banned in many countries and in multiple states here. F you Subway!
Heart and Soul Cafe=I am always skeptical about any restaurant that opens in my neighborhood. Many have been disappointing, at best. Heart and Soul Cafe restored my faith. I've only eaten there once and it was for breakfast. I was delighted to see a full two pages of interesting, creative options for breakfast. This place is run by someone who is interested in food, not just selling stuff. I had the breakfast basil sandwich. It wasn't just an egg on a crappy bagel, but an egg with crispy bacon, creamy goat cheese, fresh basil and tomato on a soft/chewy bagel. The side of potatoes was a mixture of white, sweet and blue potatoes. I'm not certain, but I think they are baked rather than fried. In any case, they were not at all greasy and were entirely delicious. Service was fine and the place is comfortable and clean. It's the kind of place I'd be willing to drive 30 minutes to visit. All the better that I can WALK there. I can't wait to go back again and again!!! Hope dinner is as good as breakfast.We have now eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Heart and Soul Cafe and can say with 100% certainty that EVERY meal rocks!For breakfast, the granola raspberry pancakes OR the Italian sausage Fritatta , both at only 8.99, will make you want to try everything on the menu.For lunch, a fresh peach salad with grilled chicken OR a chicken salad sandwich, served with homemade chocolate chip cookies fresh from the oven, really hit the spot.For dinner, the  buttermilk fried chicken is worth the trip. Served with country pork gravy, it is like no other fried chicken you have ever tasted. and that's saying a mouthful!  We came back the NEXT night and ordered the salmon with fresh mango salsa served over grilled asparagus and baby roasted sweet, blue, red and white potatoes. WOW, a burst of fresh flavor combinations in every bite.Dessert, that is another area where Chef Sheila (the owner) shines! The red velvet cake with chocolate sauce is in a class by itself. The hot nut pie with vanilla ice cream, to die for. The apple cake served with hot cider sauce, mmmmmmmmmmmm...the temptations never stop.When you combine the relaxing and fun atmosphere, the superior menu offerings, with specials that change nightly, and the value,  you will not find a better home cooked meal in the Valley.Heart & Soul says it all.  They care about every detail.
Laïka=Service is always spacey but sexy, food and beer are fine and reasonably priced, free wifi, nice sunken spot with giant windows on St Laurent corner  Duluth (lovely) with constantly great music from local djs. Bonus, sit here for hours drinking coffee or beer, no one will bother you.
DJT=From:  Absentee, TroubleTo:  Me; Undisclosed Female RecipientsSent:  Monday, July 14, 2008 8:07 PMSubject:  Juicy details...What did I miss, girls?!  I want all the juicy details...xoxo-------------------------------From:  MeTo:  Absentee, Trouble; Undisclosed Female RecipientsSent:  Tuesday, July 15, 2008 10:36 PMSubject:  Juicy details...How should I put this.  The juiciest part of the last minute get-away, I think, had to have been the burger from DJT - the restaurant located in the new Trump International Hotel.  I'm saying, on the one hand, that the mar-a-lago turkey burger, crunchy pickle and curried ("Donald Trump special seasoning") and seasoned steak fries were no joke, standout.  I wanted to write home and cry.  On the other hand, it's also an implication of a rather tame weekend.  Hey, don't call me a liar!  It can happen.  Sure, it's Vegas, the City of Sodom and Gomorrah, where vagrants and degenerates battling clinical addictions with last weekend's poker chips still buried in their pockets fly solo to fade into the background.  ("Sir, I don't mind so much your musk of ashtray and sweat and vodka, but you are 5'1'' and I have no idea why your little elbows and knees require so much room that they must dominate my seat as well.")So sorry to disappoint, babe.  We are classy (old) ladies -- the few found that weekend without teeny weeny tank tops obscenely stretched thin just barely over our buns*.  You were there with us in spirit though, especially when we spotted a softer Clive Owen-type displaying his package in speedos.  You would have had him for lunch.  For sure.Next time!  You and your bewitching dimples are coming with us.  Let's make sure to retain a good attorney and have that phone call ready.xo.i*Not all modern day tunics function autonomously as dresses.  In fact, many of them don't or shouldn't, depending on your body type.  But hey, whatever.  You go sister.  Get down with your bad self and do what makes you feel good.  During the day window shopping, I think I overheard a little baby girl ask her mama why no women in Las Vegas wears pants.  At least I think that's what she said.  Because if I were that little one, that's what I'd wonder.
Chipotle Mexican Grill=I will never understand why places like Chipotle (even Taco Bell) who have all the food precooked, and all the server has to do is scoop it into a tortilla or dish and wrap it up, can still manage to work so slowly as to get their line backed up for 15 minutes with only a few people in it (as if I'm at a Subway)!   I am not at all prejudiced against hippydreadlock folk based on appearance, but the rasta chick happened to be the problem this night, since she was moving in slow motion like she was blazed off of her gourd.I don't understand why I can get as much salsa as I want, on the side in a cup, with my burrito and there's no charge, but as soon as I order a bag of tortilla chips then i HAVE TO pay for that same cup of salsa.Still good food when it's what you're in the mood for, but this particular Chipotle loses a star for gross incompetence.
Tri Express=Tri Express is the size of a walk-in closet yet packs a ton of personality in both decor and personnel: master sushi chef Tri is friendly (haven't cleaned my hand since shaking his!) and his place is just as bright and welcoming.And the sushi's delicious.While this BYOB is a charming date spot, sizable parties may wish to opt for take away. Get the omakase menu to go (no joke). Everything is expertly prepared and packaged, ready to handle the trek to your flat. The sushi is marvelously fresh, the sashimi heavenly, and the flavors creative (try the rice crackers topped with seafood). Plus, there's plenty of wasabi and ginger if needed.Bring cash.
Salty Senorita=My husband and I ate here last night for the first time, and we will never go back.  We didn't know that it is really only a place for drinking, not eating.The chips were greasy and all broken in small pieces.  The salsa was not anything I would want to eat again.  My husband ordered the tortilla soup and he said it was ok.  I ordered the fish tacos and took one bite.  It didn't taste right.  My husband tried one bite and had to spit it in to his napkin.  They were bad.  Spoiled or something.  My side of sour cream was warmish, not cold.  My husband tried his chili cornbread and it was burned, greasy, and not cooked through in the middle.  I had ordered a side of guacamole and it was overly salty and did not taste fresh or right either.  I noticed that there was a prep area near the edge of the restaurant where waitresses cut avocados and scooped them out.  Bottles of their "salsa" were left out and not returned to the tubs of ice, where I assume they were supposed to go.  It did not look clean or well maintained.  Vile!We told the waitress that the fish tacos were bad and they did take it off our bill, but to be honest they could have taken everything off the bill.  Nothing was worth paying for!  No wait, my husband had a margarita and he said it was pretty good.  So that's it.  I guess the Salty Senorita is a loud  annoying place to have a good margarita and a decent bowl of tortilla soup.The people who patronize this establishment are the kind of people that bring their babies and/or children to the bar on Friday night. Just stop and think about that for a moment.You have a baby.................. in a bar???To add insult to injury, the Chupacabra margarita tastes like dirty, soapy ass. How dare they insult my precious X Files by naming this horrific drink after the mystical character that Fox and Dana chased after in one of my favorite episodes ever? Blasphemy. Finally, I will close this review with the tweet I sent whilst using the ladies restroom (yes, I tweet and pee at the same time):"If you are ever looking for a dirty, sloppy, drunken lay then head to the womens restroom at salty senorita peoria"Oh, PS... Thanks to Andrew K I just realized I missed the most important text of the night:"I'm too drunk to be alive. Sincerely, in hell in Peoria""Hi my name is Ashley and I'll be taking care of you. It's happy hour (pointing at the menu), the drink specials are there and the food specials there. Because it's happy hour you may not modify anything in anyway."Hi Ashley.Awkward.Arrived with my bestie for happy hour and it was early so the place was empty. I mean empty. Like Paris Hilton's head empty. Totally cool. I was already LOVING the huge patio overlooking a beautiful park/baseball field. We enjoyed HH margaritas (tasty!), taquitos (oddly only two, but, hey, it's HH) and a BUTT LOAD tray of nachos (awesome, I must say).My company was so lovely, by the time we left, I hadn't noticed the small crowd of folks who had wandered in, so I can't speak of the crowd. OK service. Great view of the park. Fabulous prices on the margs and nachos.Most of all. Great company!Well...sitting here with my man and we are NOT impressed. The decor is nice on the inside...but the service is non existent!! The beer selection is awful and their drafts aren't even working! One of the guys behind the bar seemed annoyed at us when we asked about the beer and the selection and did not even really sound enthusiastic to be working. We are sitting outside and see at least THREE servers. None have come up to its and asked us for anything. Honestly the fastest server was my boyfriend who had to go up to the bar for some ice water!!! Really?!?! C'mon. Not to mention the parking lot isn't lit up and the front doesn't have a light on the outside. It looked closed and kinda scary. I wouldn't come through that door alone. I'm only here for a friend's birthday. If it weren't for him I would never step foot in this placeOh...just to add..went to the bathroom. There is someone trying to sell knic knacks! I couldn't find the soap cause there was women's products all over the counter. And this picture on the wallThis review has been a long time coming. I go here with my girlies when we are craving a margarita and fundido. That is THE only reason why we choose this place. Other than location as it is closer to us. Their margaritas are okay, I usually get the Pom Pom. But lately it's rare when we get a good glass of it. Lately it's very syrupy or too sour. Last night was a good example of why I give this place two stars. My girls and I get there at 9:30pm, we are ignored by the waitress for fifteen minutes. She saw us first arrive and continued to serve her other tables. After fifteen minutes, my friend gets up and walks to the table behind us where the server is chatting personally with and asks if we could get service. She comes to our table and asks if we wants menus. She brings us menus. Ten minutes later, it's been 25 minutes now that we have been here. We have no drinks, just menus. She finally comes back over after we flag her down again. We ask for a manager and put in an order. It's now past 10pm and we are hungry, and there's no other place open around to go to if we leave. Manager comes over and gives us ten reasons and excuses as to why we probably weren't served within reasonable time. Finally he apologizes and says he'll take care of some things for us on our tab. Our server comes over with our drinks and finally apologizes. Okay, no problem you're forgiven. The night goes well after that... We order a second round of drinks and they're disgusting. We send them back and ask for our tab. The waitress apologizes. The manager comes over and says he took a drink off for each of us to make up for waiting.... I tell him "You mean the one drink we sent back... and didn't drink?" (We only ordered two total drinks each.) He says "damnit", walks away, and never does anything to take care of us. Every time I come here it takes so long to get service. But the fundido is delicious that we can't resist coming once every six months.... after we have forgotten how bad the service usually is.
Lillie's Asian Cuisine=I came to the Golden Nugget to see a show and decided to have dinner at Lillie's.  I was seated promptly in a mostly empty restaurant.  I was brought my iced tea quickly and then I ordered.For starters, I had their marinated jelly fish with sesame oil, chilis, and some thinly sliced pickled vegetables.  The sauce made with the oil and chilis gave the jelly fish a very good taste.  This was the first time I had jelly fish and I found it good.  Chewy and not too flavorful in itself.  It needs a good dressing, like pasta, to give it some flavor.For the main course, I got the curry chicken clay pot.  The dish was listed as spicy and it was.  When brought to the table, my server cautioned me not to touch the bowl as it was very hot.  When he removed the lid of the pot, the dish was bubbling from the high temperature.  I let it cool for a minute or so.  The thing that caught my eye on the menu was the chicken was in a coconut curry sauce and it had pineapple as well as mushrooms and some normal vegetables in Chinese food.  The pieces of pineapple went well with the heat of the curry.  The portion was large enough it could be split by two.  I wasn't going home after dinner or I would have taken some home in a take out container.My server suggested three items from the menu and I ended up with the lemon yuzu cake.  It was quite good and a nice finish to the meal.Service was excellent.  Iced tea was refilled often and for each course the server and the manager came by to check and make sure everything was OK.
Pho Cali=If you're famished, this Chinatown spot will do the trick on the cheap.Get their com suon nuong (#19 on the menu), a grilled pork chop and salad on rice. Tender meat, decent sauce. Good-sized portion, too - you won't leave hungry. Their rolls appetizer is okay, but overall, you're in for a comforting Vietnamese meal.Mysteriously, the staff weren't willing to combine two tables for a large group, so that group left. The place wasn't even packed! Go figure, their loss.This place is packed during lunchtime. However, you won't wait very long, because service is extremely fast. Not the place for a long lunch. I had glazed pork with a spring roll and vermicelli. I thought it was very good. My friend liked the pho. They give you tea and they will give you more if you ask . Prices are very good. $10 or less for both of us. Nothing in the menu is above $15.
Wild West Buffet=We came here on a couple times on a Friday night and had their Prime rib AYCE for $12.96 (We used the Caisno Guide BOGO)- The buffet is very simple. American, Mexican, Salad bar, pizza, soup and grill. - The best part about this buffet and the only reason why we come here is just for Friday nights for their Prime Rib.- Great prime rib. They actually re-grill a somewhat rare slab and it is amazing! Very flavorful, and not dry. I love it. - They make fresh cheeseburgers. We order the cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushrooms with freshly fried french fries. - For the price of about 6.50 per person, this buffet beats any fast food American restaurant. - Free sodas with buffet. - Always empty so service is always nice. - I don't touch much of the other stuff. It's more like AYCE prime rib and burgers haha. - Chicken soup is very salty. - Compared to Feast buffet, Feast is better. - 11.99 Fri Sat is for Blue Ace members. - Closes at 9pm Friday. They start cleaning the buffet at 9:15 and it closes at 9:30pm
Las Palmas Mariachi Restaurant=The 2 previous reviews want you to believe this is the best mexican party place around.I must have missed the party because at 12 noon it was completely DEAD-no lunch crowd.And they failed to mention this is in the Commercial Center plaza. A very scary place to go let alone eat.Well the place is huge seating for 100+ people and a large stage plus private boothes.The chips are hard & flavorless and the salsa too tomatoey and no spice at all. NO BEANS either.The prices were very moderate and the portions were fair but nothing really special.I ordered the Carne Asada plate for $10-the carne asada was nice & tender but it was not charbroiled as the description on the menu claimed.The pico was weak and the jalapeno had no spice at all.MY wife had a carne asada taco which was pretty large and also a cheese enchilada which was the highlight of the entire meal.I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the place since there was NO crowd and it was also pretty lackluster food, NOT spicy at all.Thank goodness I had a restaurant.com coupon for $10 OFF.Obviously a lot of people reviewing are not open minded. The area isn't the best but you probably won't get shot here either. We went here in June for my boyfriends parents 25th anniversary. It was at night during Mariachi performances so it was EXTREMELY loud. This is OK if you enjoy that type of thing, and it is certainly a unique experience. The singer is super sweet and dedicated a song to his parents and even did a special announcement.For the food, I ordered a vegetarian burrito and nachos. Everyone else ordered various things. The food is REALLY delicious! I've been to a lot of Mexican restaurants around the country and this one is easily one of the best. The food IS authentic, I live with hispanic people and it's pretty much on par, so I don't know what some reviewers are talking about. I was impressed and I plan to go again VERY soon! Such as today. :)
Pars Persian Cuisine=First, I'll start by saying that the food, once I was served, was good. Nowhere near worth the price. Certainly not worth the wait.The only reason I came by here was that they have a sign proclaiming that they are mostly gluten-free. I walked in, the place is empty, and I waited quite a while before anyone bothered to come out and seat me, without a menu. Eventually the waitress brought me out pita bread with onions. I asked her if the pita bread was gluten-free and she told me of course it wasn't.Now, I figured this, however, if your restaurant is proud to be gluten free, and hangs a sign outside to encourage customers seeking gluten-free foods then a) you should ask first before you bring out (not counting desserts) the main item of food that ISN'T gluten-free out to your customer and b) don't be rude to your customer. Look, you just basically waved something delicious that I miss in front of me and in effect said "too bad you can't have this."Getting past that, I was finally given a menu, and PLENTY of time to decide what I wanted. I ordered the Chicken Filet Sultani, which is chicken kabob with a ground meat koobideh kabob.The koobideh was good, the chicken was kind of tough. Not dry, but maybe overdone. I then also had to wait for the waitress to come around for me to pay the bill. I just dropped cash and left.If you are craving Persian food and you are in North Scottsdale, do not go to Pars. Get back onto Frank Lloyd Wright and drive west until you get to Scottsdale Road, then go north a little way and enjoy The Persian Room.
China Mama Restaurant=The XLB isn't the best I've ever had...I still feel like Joe's Shanghai in NYC gets that nod.  But it's the closest I'll get so I'll take it.  We've ordered quite a few things off the menu and all the dishes have be delicious with my favorite being the sliced fish in hot chili sauce which was worth every penny ($14).  I've only gotten stuff for takeout but the seating area seems pretty decent and would consider eating there at some point.Christmas Day, the young man was craving some cong you bing (scallion pancakes) and I had read about China Mama on here. I was pretty certain they'd be open, but just to make sure I called beforehand. I tried starting at 10am but no answer.... closer to 11am they answered and indeed were open -- at 11am!We headed over there, got seated, looked at a menu and our server, a Shanghainese man, seemed quite pleased to speak my home dialect with me.They don't have salty soy milk and if you want sweet soy milk, you can add the sugar yourself. What they bring to you is a bowl of plain soy milk -- which was fine by us because we added some vinegar and soy to it and it sufficed. Not the best, but it worked.The XLB arrived right after the soymilk and immediately, I knew they wouldn't be very good. A few had pierced through so all the juicy liquid had oozed out. I picked up an XLB and put the thing in my mouth after dipping it into vinegar -- hmmmm --- the piece of meat was too dense -- definitely not good enough for me to come back just for these, but what followed turned out to be a really wonderful surprise.Potstickers arrived and after biting into one I was completely sold! These were some of the most perfect potstickers I've ever had -- crispy on the bottom and still succulent everywhere else. the wrapper wasn't too thick and the filling not too small -- it was pretty damn good!Sheng jian bao (don't know what they are called in English) are these little buns which contain pork. I've not had anything this perfect in the US. The bottom was crispy and the top had the perfect pillowy softness of the bao. Most places I've had these at would steam the bun first and then fry the buns when you order. This is the wrong way to cook these. The name 'sheng jian bao' literally means pan frying the bun from its raw format. What they do is, they fry the raw bun in a pan, add liquid, close the lid to 'steam' the bun as it cooks the filling and the top part of the bun, remove lid and wait until the bottom is dry, remove and serve. And how do I know that these were done the correct way? Well, there is a certain crust that forms on the bottom and around the bun and these ones had it. The other sign is that the bun part is like a pillow when you bite into them, not hard and dense like those you might find at dim sum where they steam the buns and then pan fry them.Definitely some of the best sheng jian baos ever!Cong you bing -- was okay, wasn't the best I've ever had, a little too greasy, but they used enough scallions so it was a plus.I saw another table had the beef roll and couldn't resist but order some. This was another dish which is done to perfection here! They are generous with the five spiced beef filling and the condiments like cilantro is ample but not too much or too little. The sweet sauce they drizzle into it is also not overtly sweet and so, enhances the flavors without making it sickly sweet.Definitely some really above average Chinese/Taiwanese breakfast foods I've tasted! This will stay on my list of places to return to whenever we're in town!4.5 stars!I'm half Chinese but I'm not a big fan of Chinese food.  I do, however, appreciate good xiao long bao (soup dumplings) but not a lot of places in Vegas can do it right.  China Mama's xiao long bao was perfect!  The soup inside the dumplings was hot but not enough to the point you burn your mouth.We also got pork chop rice which was really good.  It's like salt and pepper pork without the bones.  The salted pork stir fried with garlic leaves was ok - not quite the way I like my pork cooked...it was quite salty like Spam.  The pan fried pork buns tasted like the xiao long bao except it bun form.  Their jasmine tea was excellent and not watered down like in some other Chinese restaurants.The service was ok...it's a Chinese thing.  Don't expect superb service, it's not going to happen!  They did attempt to speak to us in Chinese but the only words I remember nowadays are curse words.Four-and-a-Half Shiny Stars for China Mama Restaurant!  I'm super picky about my Chinese food because many of the restaurants cater to the Western palate.  China Mama is as authentic as it gets!  The restaurant is located off the main Las Vegas strip in a small strip mall.  The restaurant offers Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese food.My table mates were very safe with their food offerings, but I threw in a couple of my favorites.  To start, we had the Mongolian Beef.  I didn't order this, but I'm glad that someone did.  The dish was created with very tender and flavorful beef sauteed with white onions, green onions, and a hint of garlic.  The flavor was outstanding, and I think this was the best Mongolian Beef that I've ever had!   Grade:  A!The second dish was the restaurant favorite, Xiao Long Bao (XLB).  The XLB came out 8 to a serving and was served piping hot.  Each dumpling has a bit of juice in it and it had very strong flavors of ginger.  Delicious and fun to eat.  Grade:  BThe third dish was basil chicken.  Served in a little pot with a gel flame to heat the dish, the chicken was cooked with a soy glaze and heavy hints of basil.  I again didn't order this, but glad that someone did.  The flavors were bold and strong.  Grade:  A-The fourth dish was stir fried green beans.  Typical string beans sauteed with green onions, garlic, and dried shrimp.  It was delicious!   They added additional flavors in this dish that made it taste more savory than the typical way it is presented in other restaurants.  Grade:  B+The fifth dish was the spicy fish hot pot.  This dish can be ordered as non-hot or as bit arsh hot that you can stand it.  We ordered the dish as spicy.  The fish was generous, delicious and hearty.  There was cabbage (napa cabbage) below the fish.  The soup was presented in a soup-oil broth complete with spicy red peppers!  One thing that I missed about this dish was that it didn't have the typical szchuan peppercorns that numb the tongue.   The dish was spicy, but it didn't have the depth that it normally has with the peppercorns.  Grade:  B+Service was great!  There was two main waitresses that worked the 20+ tables.  The younger of the two (daughter?) was very pleasant and allowed me to practice my Chop Suey Chinglish (I tried to speak Taiwanese / Mandarin / Cantonese all at once).  She understood me 100% and I had a good laugh!  The older waitress was a bit more serious!This is a great place ot take family and/or friends.  They have an extensive menu of items (7+ pages of dishes!).Food Grade:  B+/A-Service Grade:  B+/A-Worth the Money Grade:  B/B+Overall Impression:  B+/A-Items Selected:Beef RollGreen Onion PancakeSteamed Juicy Pork BunsMama's Special Pan Fried Pork BunsSteamed Red Bean BunTea Smoked DuckWalnut PrawnTechnically located on Jones, but just steps from Spring Mountain, China Mama had long been on my 'must visit' list thanks, in part, to strong reviews from several palates I trust.  Every bit an unassuming space, a veritable 'hut' in the lot adjacent Chada Thai, it was on entry that friends were located at a nearby table and with the extensive menu quickly perused under the watchful eye of a server who seemed intent on making sure there was never a moment of pause throughout our 70-minute stay an order was placed - the seven item onslaught soon to begin as the table filled quickly with far too much food for any three people to eat.Beginning with items from the oft-raved "pastry" section before progressing to selections delineated by the origin of their protein, the meal began with Mama's signature Beef Roll and with the pan-kissed noodles stuffed thick with supple beef and light scallions both flavors and textures popped, a similar compliment due to the unctuous  pancake - the poignant flavor profile bolstered by a side of thick hoisin-like sauce that paired beautifully both here and with plate of intensely smoky bone-in duck.Delving next into a steamer of XLB that was a bit light in soup despite excellent sapor from a ball of briny pork it was onward to walnut shrimp that our meal progressed and although occasionally overwhelmed by mayonnaise this version was perhaps the most impressive of the afternoon, a large portion of crisp and sweet crustaceans more than justifying the $18.95 menu price that proved on par with those at Blossom for best I've tasted in Las Vegas to date.More than sated at this point it was almost comical just how large Mama's Special Pan Fried Pork Buns turned out to be, and although some were regrettably packed up as leftovers due to a frank lack of capacity the crispy exterior yielding a pocket of seared pork amidst rich aromatics still enticed me enough to eat three, a steamer of red bean buns intended as 'dessert' picked at simultaneously with subtle sweetness proving an excellent juxtaposition to the brine of the pork while the creamy filling was forgivingly light at the end of a rather substantial meal.No different than many of the eateries surrounding Spring Mountain in terms of scene and service but excelling with regard to the food China Mama is every bit worthy the high praise it has received from persons both local and distant.  Admittedly a bit more expensive than Cathay House or Chang's but far superior to the former and without the dim-sum service issues of the later a large-group exploration of a more extensive swath of the menu seems pertinent.
Humble Pie=This is my first review!! Anyway... Humble Pie. My co-worker and I went for lunch today after reading the mixed reviews on here, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I love Pizza, and if it was socially acceptable for me to eat it for every meal, I really would; I think that Humble Pie definitely meets my standards. We sat outside on the patio, which normally I would love, accept for the mister/fan system combo, which made my straight- but naturally curly hair- frizz up in seconds. I was surprised to see the place relatively empty for 12:15 during the week, but I guess it's still "new." Our server, a young guy, greeted us right away with glasses of water, and had our other drinks to the table in seconds. Note to Humble Pie: if you leave the sweetener packets on the mystified tables- the sugar clumps together and doesn't come out of the packets! We ordered the Chopped Vegetable Salad to start and it was amazing! Not heavy, a little tangy, a great mixture of veggies (Asparagus, white beans, cherry tomatoes'), and the cheese was amazing! I'm a big fan of the chopped lettuce! Next, we shared two Pizza's: Chicken Pesto with Leaks and the other was a simple Margahrita. Both, were very good! The mozzarella was fresh, the tomato sauce on the Margarita was tangy and smooth, and the Chicken on the Pesto Pizza was moist and delicious! Everything was seasoned perfectly and the crust had the perfect amount of crunch. The pizza's are small, so I walked away feeling very satisfied and definitely wanting to go back! I bet at night this place is going to be packed! Hurray for Humble Pie!!I finally made it to Humble Pie last Saturday evening... I had plans with Christina P and after reading her review, I asked if she'd be interested in returning to Humble Pie with me since she had several positive experiences there already...I arrived first, and was seated right away.  The staff was attentive and friendly - Alan was our server and took great care of us.  We started with  a glass of prosecco each and decided to share the brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and the shrimp pie.  Sounds like a ton of food, but it was perfect for the two of us.  I eat a lot - especially of veggies, and I love that HP has a large selection when it comes to veggies and salads... I have to return soon to try the butternut squash and the veggie salad (both sounded great to me).I'll preface this by saying, I like the flavor of burnt food.  So, the fact that the brussel sprouts were a tad bit overdone, was fine with me... although for other patrons, it may not be so appealing.  The cauliflower was not burnt, but it didn't have so much flavor either.  Regardless, I wanted to get my vegetables in for the day, and they seemed fresh despite the way they were cooked.  Does that make sense?As some of the yelpers before me commented, we noticed the use of lemon zest in our shrimp pie.  It was light on the shrimp, sauce, and cheese, but it did have a zesty flavor to it.  I added some chili pepper flakes and parmesan as well... mmmm.As if I hadn't eaten enough food, Christina requested a small sample of the olive oil gelato so I could taste it... and I actually enjoyed it!  If you're open to trying something new, the olive oil gelato is the perfect sweet ending to your meal at Humble Pie.My 4 star rating is for my overall experience at Humble Pie - I was in fantastic company, a casual environment (which I love), and lots of veggie options to choose from... the pizza was fine - I'll try another selection next visit.I also noticed that there is plenty of bar seating for those that like to sit at the bar, hang with the bartender, etc... good to know in case I ever return solo!  Either way, I'm sure I'll be back soon.This place rocks my socks off.My co-workers at my new job brought me here as a welcome to the company gesture and I'm not lying when I say that I ate the best wood-fired pizza 'ive ever had in my entire life today. Not only did I try the Margherita, but then we decided it was necessary to order 2 more, pepperoni and some other mushroom thing. All of them were equally delicious, perfect crust and just the right amount of cheese and toppings. The Caesar salad, also awesome.. and how could we forget the full bar?! The outdoor patio is absolutely divine  this time of year and the servers there are not only very friendly, but will yell at the bartender when he pours you a weak drink. I dont remember your name dude, but thank you for being the most wonderful person of the day.I dont normally rave about pizza, and I usually only eat it when im hammered, but Humble Pie has won my heart, and I forsee many many more lunch breaks being taken here.. hammered or not.Humble Pie gets no respect.There are quite a few 'marquee' pizza places in the valley...some that come to mind would be Pizzeria Bianco, Cibo, The Parlor, Pomo, and Patsy Grimaldis. Ask a random person on Yelp what their favorite pizza place is, and chances are you're gonna hear one of those names mentioned. (This includes us by the way). I've never heard anyone say that Humble Pie is their favorite or even in their top three. I wonder why? I could be crazy...but if I was to take a Humble Pie pizza and put it in a taste test with the aforementioned places...I don't think the majority of people would notice a big difference in the level of 'goodness'. Each place has unique flavors, but they're all really damn tasty. Unless you're familiar which how each pie tastes from experience, I think you'd be stumped to identify which came from where. What I'm trying to say is Humble Pie can hang with the big boys. So...I'm sitting here wondering now...why don't more people rave about this place...why don't I myself rave about this place?! Could it be something so simple as atmosphere? Humble Pie's interior is very...should I say...humble. There's nothing snazzy or memorable about this place, other than the actual food which is quite good. Cibo is in a quaint old house, Pizzeria Bianco is overflowing with prestige and this aura of greatness from all the national attention...Humble Pie is basically just a storefront with an interior that could have very well been put together by someone who just read 'Interior Design for Dummies'...it doesn't take much chances, and it shows. So...what does that leave us with here? A pizza place with awesome food, but not much else. I definitely recommend it, but I expect it to continue to hover right below the other more well known places for the foreseeable future. 3.5/5  (Rounded up to 4 since we ate here on one of our first date nights, and I have fond memories of it.)Humble Pie really shouldn't be Humble any more...this place is awesome now!  House made Burrata...house made mozzerella...fabulous meatballs, tasty sauce on the pizzas, wild mushroom mix...the pizza, caprese are both amazing...great service and speedy for take out.We tried the wings and they are so so...but everything else was extraordinary.  Don't hesitate this place has been remarkable the 3 times I have visited recently!Yum.  I could end my review there, but my mystery "fans" might be disappointed.We had a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was almost empty.  I'm glad about that because I didn't care for the layout of the dining room.  Unless the room had been set up for a large group that had left, with the exception of counter seating and a few four-top pub tables, all the seating was 2 long rows of small tables placed about 6 inches from each other.  Although it does make it easy to set up tables for groups of any size, I'm not fond of sitting on a stranger's lap generally.  We started with a small caprese plate with house-made burrata, pesto, cherry tomatoes, balsamic, and ciabatta toasts.  We were starving, so we devoured it pretty quickly, leading the server to comment "you finished that already?"  Yes, we did, it was a small, and it was delicious.  But I appreciated her not outright saying, "wow, nice job fat-ass."Next up was the potato and roasted garlic pizza with fontina, gorgonzola, leeks, rosemary, and the addition of prosciutto.  My husband insisted I choose the pizza, and I loved every bite of it!  And the best part was I loved every bite of it because he didn't.  So I generously suggested he order another pizza knowing I would have it all to myself.  He went with the pepperoni.  Although they are very generous with the pepperoni, it's still just a pepperoni pizza.  The sauce was a little sweet for me, but I prefer a spicier sauce.  Can't wait to come back and try the pistachio pizza.  And for the record, no soggy crust!Suffice it to say...Yum.My son wanted to treat his boyfriend and me to dinner, wanted something near the theater we were headed too and something they haven't tried.  I saw Humble Pie was in the area and asked if they were game and yes they were. Now I have heard good sold things about Humble Pie from many friends so I was pretty excited to try them out.  It was Sunday night around 5:30, we walked in and where greeted right away and asked how many in the party, then the host turned his back , a server walked up and asked how many in the party, I had to answer because it appeared the host had better things to do, why even ask if you didn't even care.We were seated handed menus and drink orders were taken.  For appetizers I ordered the toasted ravioli,  they were stuffed with ricotta cheese and served with marinara sauce. To be honest this dish lacked flavor, Prego sauce has more flavor that the marinara sauce that came with it.  1/2 the raviolis were toasted perfectly, the other were just hard. Even though the dish looked great the dish didn't wow me. My son ordered the lasagna, which was the winning dish of the night, everything cooked perfectly!  His date ordered the Penne with Vodka Sauce with chicken (5 buck upcharge, when it came out it looked like adding the chicken to the dish was an afterthought, it was just a chicken breast diced up lying on top of the pasta. The sauce had great color but lacked flavor. Since I was at Humble Pie, pie is what I am getting right?  Wood oven cooked pizza sounded amazing!  I ordered the bbq chicken pizza with smoked mozzarella, bacon, fontina, green onions and bbq sauce, the bbq chicken is one of my favorite types of pizza, so I was pretty excited. When I got my pizza it looked pretty amazing, but when I started to eat it, I noticed it was covered with grease, even my crust was soaked in grease, I couldn't eat it all, my belly was becoming a grease pit, it was just too much for me.  Our server was never around (it wasn't that busy) the food was ok, the place looks like a lot of fun, the lasagna rocked, but my return rate very low.
La Piccola Cucina=I just wasn't impressed with this place. My lack of enthusiasm has little to do with being narrow-minded about food or being unable to appreciate small/local businesses. I point this out because it seems like a lot of other reviewers think that anyone who doesn't like this place (or the owner) is an unsophisticated country bumpkin or a chain restaurant freak. Well, I like to think I have a pretty open mind when it comes to food and the ability to differentiate between food that is well prepared and food that falls a little short. On top of that, I love supporting local businesses that bring something new to the table. Given all this, I really wanted to  like La Piccola Cucina, but was surprised (and a bit disappointed) when it didn't turn out to be everything I had hoped for. I tried this place a few weeks ago with the lovely Kristin S as my lunch date. The historic house was certainly adorable and the patio a wonderful spot to eat al fresco. Also,  the young man who took our orders was really polite and helpful, but the food was just not very good. I'm a big fan of the "tavola calda" (hot food served buffet style with a focus on protein and sides) model and ate at many such places in Italy, but the "hot table" at La Piccola Cucina was not so "hot." My rotisserie style chicken was incredibly dry. The skin was also overcooked and a bit flavorless.  I also tried a piece of Kristin's chicken breast and found it to be dry. The eggplant side was flavorful but so oily I felt a little queasy after eating it. The roasted zucchini side was cooked to the right texture but had a strange, almost sour, flavor to it. At a certain point in our meal, the owner came by the table and asked how we were doing. He noticed I hadn't eaten much of the chicken and asked if everything was ok. I said that I wanted to be honest and that I had found my chicken to be dry. He apologized in a way that wasn't all that apologetic and asked me if I wanted another piece of the same chicken. Confused by the offer, I declined and just said we'd come close out our tab. He didn't say anything else. I was definitely disappointed in the food, but I was even more disappointed that the owner didn't truly seem concerned that I had had a sub-par meal. If your food is incredible, then feel free to cop the "only an imbecile could dislike this" attitude. Otherwise, remain open to feedback and constantly strive to deliver a consistently good product. In my humble opinion, that's what makes for a good local restaurant that sticks around in the hard times. I'd be open to coming back here and trying a sandwich at some point, but jumping out my seat to go back here, I am not.It's located in an old house on 7th St. in the Coronado area.  Patio is awesome and has a slight European/Spanish feel to it.  The food in the deli looked appetizing and gourmet.  I ordered the prosciutto sandwich and my wife had the sirloin.   The bread was quite good and appeared to be made on location.  The prosciutto was decent.However the sirloin came out bloody at first which the owner admitted before even placing on our table.  It is supposed to be medium, per his admission, so we were confused why he even brought it out.  When my wife asked him about this he leered at her and said he knew what "medium meant", and then took it back to the kitchen.  Before this he talked to her rudely when she was looking for the restroom.  The restrooms are labeled in Italian which my wife speaks, along with French, Spanish, and English.  She paused in front of the door to adjust her purse and the aforementioned owner told her "that's right, it means ladies room in Italian", in a tone you would take with a child.  After the sirloin issue, my wife and I just stared at each other in disbelief at the audacity of this fat, bad mannered, self righteous man.When the sirloin came back out it was cooked properly but lacked flavor.  The bread was the only thing worth eating on the plate.The server who took our order was this prissy guy who lacked not only personality but any sense of being helpful.  I don't know if the owner is trying to create this New York/European "poor service because we can" atmosphere but, please, that doesn't fly here and anyone that thinks this is acceptable must have very low self esteem.  You can't talk to customers like that, I don't care how good your food may be, and in this case it was mediocre.And to clarify, I hate chain restaurants, always try to support local business, and know good food and service when I experience it.  So it's not that I "don't get it".  I will never return to this restaurant and implore you not to go here either.  Oh, and if you are the owner, rest assured I will be scathing your restaurant on other review websites along with telling every single person I know how rude you are and how mediocre your cooking is.  I promise you will make less money because of your behavior towards my wife.I had the prosciutto sandwich, and it was delicious. That's all I'm going to say about the food. Dude, the service...it sucked. I am low maintenance, and am equipped with low expecations to match, and it still sucked. All I need is a smile and maybe, I don't know, a polite greeting of some kind, and I am satisfied in the service department. Totally didn't happen here. The restaurant, per its website and posted hours, opens at 10:00 AM. I can't imagine anyone actually goes there that early, but, okay. It's when they open. Now, as anyone who has worked downtown for more than a week knows, if you want to go somewhere and get in and out and back to your desk in a manageable amount of time, you need to adjust your lunch time aim - shoot for 11:30, or shoot for 1:30. Anything in between will only bring you lines, misery, and a bitch of a time parking...especially on 7th Street. So, I mosied on over to La Piccola Cucina at exactly 11:20...an hour and twenty minutes after they opened, mind. I walked in, and was greeted by a scowling, irritated-looking girl at front counter in a hot pink sweatshirt and super tight black pants, (the owner's daughter, I was able to ascertain from newspaper clippings posted on the restaurant walls). She looked at me and said, in a very put-upon tone...are you ready for this..."Yeah? What do you need?""Yeah? What do you need?" You're working at a restaurant...it's 11:30 at this point...I've approached the counter to order...and you're copping an attitude like you can't possibly imagine what I would be doing there? Right. Keep on keepin' on, girl. DIVA FOR LIFE!I said, "Um...I'd like to order something to go..." No menus are to be seen...I later discovered that the sandwich menu is posted on the wall somewhere, but this wasn't pointed out to me. Good thing I read some Yelp reviews before I went, so I had some idea of what was available...oh, PS - the gelato cases and the food cases were empty. Totally empty. Avoiding eye contact with me, she fumbled with a bunch of papers by the register, still looking completely annoyed by my existence,."Uh, we're not even really OPEN yet." I look behind me at the clock on the wall, and the front door that is propped open all the way. I had no idea how to respond to that, so I didn't. Just awkwardly stood there till she took my order. I ordered the prosciutto sandwich, no wilted greens. Of course, it came with wilted greens, which would be forgivable if I hadn't been treated like a leper. While I was waiting, another couple came in and was helped by the owner's wife...food/gelato cases were still empty, and she wasn't super friendly, but she at least acknowledged them as human beings and pointed out where the menus were.The owner, so often immortalized in Yelp reviews as a loud, friendly, brusque gentleman, just kind of lumbered around the restaurant, frowning, without a smile or word for anyone.My sandwich was awesome, but there are too many other mom-n'-pops downtown to even bother giving business to a place where the staff cops an attitude. Really and truly. Sucks for them, because I'm the kind of person who goes back to a place over and over again, and tries everything. I tell my friends and family, I write nice reviews on Yelp. In this case, several co-workers wanted to know where I got my sandwich from, and I lied. Sorry, guys. Attitude matters.I absolutely never give a bad review. The only time I give a review is if I like it. But I had to for this one because of the owner Andy who was a pompous jerk. We tried to be friendly and he was arrogant about his cooking skills. He went on that he used to have a cooking show etc. When asked if he did the cooking he went on about he teaches the people that work for him to cook. It was like it was beneath him to cook. No wonder his little show never made it big.  I give this place 1 star because of the ambiance and because of the fabulous gelato and fabulous cappuccino and the owners wonderful daughter. We went there because of the groupon coupon we bought. They were overwhelmed to the point of being rude. Especially the owner, Andy. It seemed like they needed to staff accordingly. They were upset because people did not make reservations and just showed up. While we were there , quite a few people walked out. Its not that they were packed either. 1st of all, we tried calling several times and the phone was busy continuously. You'd think at this day and age they would have voice mail or something. 2nd you make reservations for places that are a full service restaurant not a cafeteria style service. This is a place that you look into the cooler and decide what you want that is already cooked. The food was terrible. Now if you do not cook, it may be good for you. Both my husband and I are very creative cooks. The lamb was the worst I have ever had. Dry and absolutely no flavor. Yes and I know my lamb. My husband had the dry turkey. Our son had the dry meat loaf. I think all of them were dry because they were re-heated in a microwave. We do not do that even at home. The side dishes were still bearable.    I would have gone back there for the gelato and cappuccino if we did not have other place I can get the 2.My sister and I found this restaurant through Groupon. Our first impression was good... Adorable ambiance, delicious looking case of gelato, large inviting patio.  We were greeted by a sloppy surly man, who we later found out is the owner Andy. We were seated on the patio along with the only other customer.  We started off by ordering a bottle of sparking water. "You guys don't want any wine?!" said Andy abruptly. Uh no thanks.  Next we ordered dinner.  My sister is vegetarian, so we were ordering meatless options this evening.  We ordered a selection of bland, boring, typical food. For some reason Andy seemed confused that we wanted to share a few items.  The food came... Andy dropped it and ran off.  We were sharing so we wanted plates. We waited for a long time. No Andy.  I went into the restaurant to ask for plates and some salt&pepper. Andy seemed confused. "why do you need plates? I don't get it. You eatin it like Chinese food or something?!?" He brought the plates and the salt & pepper and said "You know you really shouldn't put anything on it until you taste it." Thanks for the words of wisdom.  We ate our depressing display of  cuisine in hopes that dessert would help this disaster. We waited, and waited, and waited, and waited some more( Andy was busy sitting at the other customer's table talking all night).  By the time he finally got around to clear our plates we were so ready to get the heck outta there we decided to skip dessert. NEXT CAME THE ICING ON THE POORLY MADE CAKE:I decided to tell Andy how I felt about the poor service.  As a person in the customer service industry, I know I would appreciate the polite constructive criticism.  He was apparently OUTRAGED by the comments. He proceeded to argue with us about every comment we had.  He even went so far as to walk into the restaurant to yell to his co-workers about my apparently salacious comments.  He told me the balance of our Groupon tab was on him. I left cash on the table for it anyway.  He then chased us into the parking lot to try and give the money back.  When I refused he yelled "I don't want this I will donate it to charity!!!" WHAT!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?Yikes, reading other reviews I realize my bad experience wasn't unique. As a server I make a very laid back customer. I like pretty much everything I eat and don't require a lot of attention from the waiter. La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house. Our guy, though adorable and friendly, was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken. Like other reviewers mentioned, he was frantic and made that clear to every customer. At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person! I left super stressed out from the experience, which is very, very unusual for me. You can either have bad service or bad food, but not both.This is one of those reviews that I wish I could give a half star to and make it 3.5. I've been teetering on 3 and 4, but I'm going to round up and give it four because I liked everything about this place, I just didn't love everything about it. I like that this is a homey little shop situated in a converted house. I like how they offer counter ordering as well as sit-down dining. I also like how they have an extensive ice cream selection staring at me when I walk inside. The food is decent. The bread is soft, the salad was ok. I got half and half...half Greek salad and a half of the prosciutto mozzarella sandwich based on the raving Yelp reviews.  The Greek salad was pretty tasty but they went really heavy on the dressing. Next time I will ask for it on the side. I liked the bread, vinegar, mozzarella and peppers in the Prosciutto sandwich. I wasn't a huge fan of the Prosciutto though. I found chunks in my Prosciutto and I just wasn't prepared for chunky meat, more the thinly sliced Prosciutto. The sandwich was ok though and I finished it, but I'll probably order something different next time. I know that a lot of the reviews talk about the service, but I thought the service was pretty good! The gentleman working the restaurant is an older man, with a tough East Coast attitude, but he softened up and tried to make light and friendly conversation in his own way. I enjoyed the service and it made me feel like I was in my old Italian relative's home for dinner. This place definitely has character and I'm glad I paid it a visit. It's hard to remember to visit since it's on busy 7th Street and you can easily pass it before you realize you did. But if anything, I suggest you stop in for a homemade iced tea and gelato. The atmosphere is quaint and charming.***************SKIP THIS LOONY BIN****************+++++ Owner or Management yelling at staff member++++++More yelling ..... different staff member   We put our menus down     My Wife, and I walked out        Why would anyone, desire to dine in an asylum ??????My Ethics .... My Standards:Every business starts with one star ..... GETTING MORE .... HAS TO BE EARNED.I will not be visiting La Piccola again. I hate writing this review and I really felt like not writing one at all. I feel like I really need to let this business know where they are falling short. I do want to give a very positive review of our waitress. She was in training, but she was attentive and was our only enjoyment of the night. The two glaring problems with La Piccola:The food: did not taste fresh at all. It was something we all picked up on. My cous cous was overcooked and very bland. My chicken was seasoned well, but not cooked all the way and my asparagus was damn near raw. Let's just say I didn't finish my meal. I am only going to review my meal, but the others in our party were all disappointed. The owner Andy: is definitely not a good front of house. He really should manage in the back. We were treated poorly by the owner, who has a rude and had an arrogant way about him. I didn't touch my cous cous and Andy thought it was because my palate wasn't sophisticated enough. He didn't even think that maybe there was something wrong with it. I think Andy believes his restaurant is earth shattering here in the valley, but in reality it is just another unmemorable place under the sun.WARNING:  If you go into La Piccola Cucina alone--with a coupon worth, say, $30--do NOT expect to get your fair value, because the owner will tell you that you are alone and not getting more than one meal.  Yeah, it happened to me.  I was stunned into silence and not in the mood to argue.  You win the battle but you lose the war, Mr. Owner.Food was well done, but cold.  Yes, I said cold.  Who puts a cold plate of food before you?  Obviously it had been heated but someone didn't get it to the table fast enough, so by the time it arrived it was not hot at all.  I said...at all.  But it was well made so I ate it so fast as I could as I wanted out of there.  Interesting that it was cold because there are only like 6 tables or so there and it wasn't full at all then.And I won't be returning because the coupon thing, frankly, just totally turned me off.  I have used a coupon for much more than one meal at tons of places and this is the ONLY one that just said you aren't getting more than one meal.  Always I get two dinners for my $30 and just pay whatever the difference is (say, the two meals cost $40 so I give them the extra $10 plus tax).This owner surely didn't have a problem asking me to pay the tax on my meal also--guess just making sure he gets every penny out of you he can I guess?This guy is just plain unethical and a rip-off, so decent food or not I'm not going back, I won't be giving him any good p.r. and I am really disgusted in his "ethics."Good luck to all of you that give them business, but it won't be me or anyone I know.(I just wonder how many people came in there at his required hour of after 5 pm and he did this to?)If every business owner pumping coupons out worked like this guy does I'd give him a pass, but he is the only one I've ever encountered like this.  Conclusion:  I am guessing that this place is just barely scraping by.  I will be curious to see if it's here by next year.  Why?  Cause nobody runs coupons and screws the customers so bad like this place does.I'll give this place 2 stars for the quality of the food which is really pretty good--albiet cold in the middle of the meat-- (I didn't say fantastic...but good).  However, not cool treatment of customers rates a 2 star, sorry!I just had a terrible experience at La Piccola Cucina!I've been to this restaurant several times in the past and enjoyed the home-style cooking.  Needless to say, I was very excited when a voice daily deal came out that allowed me to purchase a $30 food voucher for $15!This place is on my way home from work, so I saved the coupon for a night that I was working late - excited to grab some delicious takeout on the way home.One of the servers was in the middle of taking my order when the owner of the restaurant saw that I had the coupon.  He snatched it angrily out of my hand shouting "this is only good for 2 people dining in - not take out!"  I informed him that this restriction was not stated anywhere on the coupon that I had purchased and he shouted back, "I don't care!  That's the way it's always been!"  In a restaurant full of other diners, the shouting continued until I was embarrassed enough to leave...I just can't believe how completely rude and belligerent he was to me - In my opinion, this is no way to ever treat your valued customers.I will be demanding a refund on my coupon and won't be returning to this restaurant again.I really wish I could give the LPC a better rating, but it would not be justified. This tiny and super cute restaurant is only about a mile away from me and because of such I have been here about 5 times. Although I could give the restaurant a 3 star, maybe even a 4 star rating on a good day, it is everything else that falls short. I have tried the sandwiches and vegetable variety plate and actually found them both to be flavorful and fresh tasting. However, the service is just...awful. And the most recent time, I would say the service fell short due to the owner and not the waitress. While the waitress seemed new, she was super friendly and attentive. Well, as attentive as she could be with the owner calling her to the back to....? Not sure....I am sure she was helping plate/cook/something, but that would leave the 6 tables or so of diners unattended. The time before we were waited on and served by the owner. He seemed nice enough but also had to keep tabs on the back of the restaurant and would be MIA for long periods of time. There is no way that anyone with an hour lunch break could eat here and realistically make it back to work on time. Finally, I have a hard time using the Groupon vouchers I have purchased here. The same day Groupon was not accepted because they already reached their limit for the day? Hmmm....Sadly, I will not be giving the LPC another try but I hope they listen to reviews on Yelp and get back on their game:)
Carnevino=I've always come to yelp to read helpful no-hold-barred reviews but this is the first time I've been moved to write one of my own because no one should waste their time and money at this "fine dining" restaurant. Before we sat at our table we had a nice glass of prosecco at the bar with a very affable bartender - it looked like we were in for a great night...until we got seated with a server who was part used car salesman part annoying high school substitute teacher.  This guy proceeded to go through and lecture us on the menu for literally 10 minutes...we can read guy and we get it you want us to order the most expensive steak you offer.  This server (I use this term very loosely because we didn't get his name) proceeded to tell us that we shouldn't consider the filet or the fish dishes (really, Batali puts items on his menu that aren't good?) and that the sides aren't like Ruth Chris "you can't just order them" - what does that even mean?  So after mentioning that they keep many of the items in Italian to encourage "a dialogue" we knew that this was one strange place.  The night before my vegetarian friend suggested I get the buccatini without the pork and she recommended I get the small size, which is literally enough for one person but I should have been tipped off when they said they'll try and push the big size.  OK I'm a vegetarian and even though I'm going to a place called Meat & Wine I'm allowed to be there and eat what I like.  So after asking for the buccatini sans pork he looked and me and said he wouldn't do it..."if we start taking things out of our dishes it'll just get strange and I don't want to put a plate of strange in front of you."  I'll be the judge of strange buddy and don't bs me because my friend ordered it last night.  HE WOULDN'T TAKE MY ORDER AND SAID "I'LL COME BACK TO YOU!"  What happened to the "dialogue" he promised earlier?  Needless to say he hassled everyone of my friends about our orders saying zingers like "that's just 5 bites and won't be enough" "you have to get all of your orders in now because it'll just get awkward if you want more food later."  After we ordered we all decided to leave because we were made to feel so uncomfortable - these servers must be working on commission. I spoke to the matre'd on the way out who to his credit was very apologetic and flabbergasted the waiter wouldn't adhere to my vegetarian request.  He offered to seat us in another section - we just wanted to get out of this boiler room so he paid for our drinks.  If this restaurant wants to survive they need to chill out on the hard sell and let people order sizes and portions they feel comfortable with - even though I wasn't getting a steak for 2 I would have drank for two!If I was a good girl (which I'm not most of the time), and I died (which will happen one day) I would end up at Carnevino for the rest of my life.Nestled between three (no four, no six) of my most favorite things (craps, blackjack, the schlots, and the strip bitches)is Carnevino, tucked under the back escalators of The Palazzo . With high ceilings, huge windows, and an intimate, darker settling, Mario Batali has cooked up some of the best food I've have ever had. EVER! I repeat EVER! Carnevino is a must have on my list every time I visit my home away from home, the city of sin. With delicious starters, like petite fried cheeseballs delicately wrapped in a napkin with amazingly fresh butter, your palate begins to sing while reading the menu. The fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomato salad was incredible. The cheese had flavor I haven't had since Italy. The olive oil by itself was flavorful, delicate, rich, but didn't overpower anything. The basil was perfect and aromatic beyond belief.And then came the pasta. Parpardelle with porcini mushrooms with a fresh reggiano grated on top that was to die for. Perfectly al dente, with amazing texture and flavor, I ate until I thought I would throw up, literally. His steak, the larger fillet mignon was done to perfection, black and blue. Beautiful and pink in the inside, charred on the outside, plated, alone on a large white plate. Nothing, just the steak of perfection, seated, alone. You can choose a variety of sauces to come with the meat, he, choosing after my favorites, opted for the black truffle sauce. We expected a flavored truffle oil, but no, a full gravy sized dish came, laden with amazing petite pieces of black truffle, all nestled at the bottom. When he looked left, I dug into the sauce with my spoon, and it was true. They were pieces of truffle, no essence, not shavings, but pieces. I was in heaven. I could die now, or maybe after I make 50K at craps first. We were too full, and couldn't eat anymore, but our server, who I have had many times, recommended the pumpkin doughnuts. Anyone who knows me can answer the question, "If Danielle had 24 hours to live, what would she eat?" and answer with confidence, "Doughnuts". Is that your final answer? Well, maybe doughnuts and truffles, but separately of course.The tiny doughtnut hole sized bites were fried pieces of perfection. Crispy, covered with sugar and cinnamon, with a thick, rich pumpkin interior. It was like the best pumpkin pie you've ever had, on crack, mixed with a doughnut. Amazing! It took twenty minutes to get up from the table after that.But craps was calling me, and you know what I'm like when I gamble. I only stop to pee, drink, smoke, and eat, at Carnevino of course.I've eaten at Carnevino a couple of times in the lounge area where I've ordered from the less expensive bar menu, and have been thoroughly impressed (they have a better fancy burger than Bradley Ogden, if you ask me) so my husband and I decided to eat in the dining room for our first anniversary on Sunday. The understated decor is reminiscent of a simple yet sophisticated Italian country villa, and the general aura is relaxed and welcoming. Every person on the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the managers were gracious and accommodating. Because it was our anniversary we each received a complimentary glass of Bastianich's own Brut upon arrival (normally $14 a pop), but more notably, because we are locals, we received 15 % off our entire bill. I believe Batali is the only chef thus far to offer such a discount on a regular basis, and he should be commended for it. For an appetizer we ordered the pappardelle with 'porcini trifolati,' or cooked porcini mushrooms($22). Porcini mushrooms are my favorite mushroom. They are generally large and have a sponge-like underside rather than gills, giving them a kind of chewy yet slippery texture. When I saw porcini I got incredibly excited because the only place I have seen fresh porcini mushrooms in the states is at the Ferry Building farmer's market in San Francisco. While living in Italy they could be found everywhere in the Fall, even at road stands, and I frequently ordered this exact dish whenever I could. Needless to say I was truly disappointed when the dish came out full of shitakes and other varieties of mushrooms, with nothing like the porcinis I know and love. If the menu had just said 'pappardelle with mushrooms' I would have been completely satisfied, as the pasta was beautifully home-made and tossed in a light yet buttery sauce. Sadly, this misrepresentation showed up more than once on the menu. Our spinach side was supposed to have cherry peppers to give a kick, yet didn't, and our 'spring peas with pancetta' turned out to be snow peas. The steak was the real showstopper of the meal. I try to be frugal when dining out, but as a self-proclaimed foodie I am also willing to pay big money for something novel and ridiculously good. That something today was the 240 day dry-aged steak that cost $100 an inch. Dry-aging of beef is basically the controlled rotting of the exterior of the meat in a cold environment that results in the formation of a skin, or pellicle, that is then removed prior to cooking. It is an expensive process and therefore results in better, but less frugal, cuts of meat. Most well-marbled high grade meat is dry-aged for some amount of time as it dramatically enhances and concentrates the flavor, but this time can range from a few weeks to about the 240 days given the riserva steak here (we were told the slaughter date for our beef was circa early August, 2009). A second manager prepared it for us tableside by skillfully slicing it on a wooden board and drizzling it with the chef's recommendation of a little olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. We ordered the horseradish black pepper zabaglione as an accompanying sauce, but despite its ethereal qualities, it was utterly unnecessary and almost felt like a sin to use on this particular piece of meat. The inherent flavors of the steak were not powerful enough to stand up to it, and only by eating the steak alone could you truly appreciate the process and time required to create such a masterpiece. The wait staff described the flavor as earthy, but for me it was as if the aroma you get when you first walk into a fabulous cheese store (such as Murray's in the West Village) found its way into the meat and then ultimately into your mouth in a subtle yet obvious way. Combine that with the intensely flavored juices of the best quality steak you can buy and the result is unlike anything you've had before. As I continued to analyze the complexity of flavors twinkling in my mouth I looked over at my husband and saw teardrops welling in his eyes. When he noticed I was looking at him he said, "I'll cry over meat, I don't give a f*#!." I was hoping he was tearing up over how happy he felt to be married to me, but no, it was the steak he was feeling such a fondness for. I really wasn't hurt at all because I felt the same, and in all fairness, you can't have a steak like that everyday for the rest of your life. As far as Strip restaurants go, I would be more inclined to come back here rather than try some of the other celebrity chef restaurants I haven't yet been to. Usually you don't get what you pay for, but I felt the prices charged here were deserved. To boot, the service and ambiance were top notch without being stuffy. If you are looking for a special occasion place, Carnevino is now on my list of top ten Strip restaurants. For my full review, go to my blog.Italian + Steak. What a heavenly combination. From start to finish my business dinner here was pretty fan-freaking-tastic. Impeccable service and some amazing food. Having dined at most of the big name steak places over at Palazzo-Venetian (Cut-Delmonico-Carnevino), I'm going to try to offer some tips to help you select your next insanely expensive steak dinner !Pork back fat. Yup, that was the waiter's description when he set down a creamy paste called "lardo" and I said "excuse me?!" As disgusting as a paste called lardo described as "pork back fat" sounds.. wow it's fabulous. I felt guilty eating more than like a teaspoon of it, but that's ok. Only issue here was the ciabatta served with the back fat was only barely warmed over. Wine list. What a treasure trove of Italian wines they have. For those not on a budget this wine list is killer. Their beer list is also ridiculously good might I add, but most beers were $15+! There were only 5 wines south of $100 and the markup is among the worst I've seen in Las Vegas. Our $110 wine we drank retails for $17 . Over 500% markup?! Sick for even Las Vegas if you ask me. For an appetizer we only tried the beef carpaccio. Amazing and among the best I've had in my life. We got 2 orders for 7 of us and we were fighting for the last scraps. Highly recommended ! Before I get into the steak, I want to pay hommage to the mashed potatoes with a poached egg mixed in. Some of the best mashed potatoes I've had in my life. That good ! Now onto the..STEAK: I personally tried half of the "ribeye for 2". At $130 it's insanely expensive. Add $15 if you want them to pour some aceto balsalmico on it (ridiculous surcharge). The presentation was beautiful and the steak was among the best in Vegas. One of my dining companions is a steak freak and declared the steak here the best of his life. The seasoning, char, and preparation were all perfect.  As a comparison to other places -*Delmonico's ribeye isn't as tasty, but a WAY better value. You get nearly the same amount of meat on a "1 person" steak at Delmonico as you do on a "2 person" steak at Carnevino. At Delmonico the steak retails for ~$60. It's freaking $130 here. Yes, Carnevino's is better, but is it $70 better? I would say no for those that have big appetities ! *Tasting platter at Cut retails for ~$130. Honestly I'd take this over the steak at Carnevino most days. It's more exciting (having Japanese wagyu, american wagyu, AND prime on it) and I really do think the wagyu beef is worth the premium. *So basically comes down to how price sensitive you are, whether you want one steak done really well with a beautiful char, or are you looking to try wagyu. As a wagyu freak I do slightly prefer Cut but I know some people aren't believers in the magic of wagyu! Overall a solid steakhouse and the addition of Italian fare to the typical steakhouse meal is fabulous. Service was impeccable . I hope to return many times in the future.Glad we came back for another "snack" that ended up being dinner!Again, we ended up in the bar and shared a tasty bottle of chianti.  I was surprised, honestly, at how few chiantis were on the menu.  There were tons of super tuscans and other varieties, but maybe only 5 chiantis.  Weird.  Anyhow, on to the food:-We were given warm rosemary focaccia bread with a salty butter mousse as well as a 'lardo' mousse.  The lardo is made from curing strips of pig fat with rosemary and is quite rich; it is a nice addition to the hearty bread, but definitely in moderation!-Started with the Affettati Misti (meat plate, basically) and the  House Cured Pastrami.  The meat plate was decent, but nothing to write home about.  I wouldn't order it again.  However, the pastrami blew me away!  It was thick, peppery, and so good!  It came with a small salad of frisee with a wonderful duck egg on the top.  The flavors came together so well.  Yum!-With the pastas, they are served as 'appetizer' style, so they're perfect for sharing.  However, you can order any one as a diner portion for 15 bucks more.  We shared the Bucatini Amatriciana, which is still the best one I've tasted outside of Rome, and the surprisingly amazing Ravioli di Stracotto (duck livers with aged balsamic vinegar). The ravioli was to die for! I wanted to order three more dishes of it!  Overall, I was very pleased with our food and wine, which was served in these beautifully tall glasses.  I will return during my next trip!  Do yourself a favor and try it out!The unofficial Internet poker baller's steakhouse of choice for good reason, its great.The restaurant has two distinct dining areas.  The Taverna is a good choice for a snack anytime.  Lets just say the best calamari anywhere.  Lightly dusted with rice flour, fried crisp and served with a spicy tomato sauce.  Wow!  The beef carpaccio is equally good.The restaurant proper offers more in-depth choices of antipasti, pasta, and meat.  There is something for everyone.  Veal sweetbreads are impressive. The veal chop is incredible but at $75 it better be.  The lamb is also wonderful.  Perfectly trimmed and not excessively fatty.  Steaks are very good.  Table side service for the shared steaks adds a nice touch.  Keep in mind, this is not a true steakhouse.  Its all about offering high quality, land based red meat, prepared well.The clientele is very eclectic.  Well dressed folks for an evening on the town and on a recent visit, my bud and I in jeans and t-shirt off from a hard day of grinding.  Bottom line, they make you feel welcome.The wine list is well chosen.  By the glass list is equally good.  Prices are average for Vegas.Worth its baller status!Carnevino is Mario Batali's high-end steakhouse in Las Vegas (located in The Palazzo).  With steakhouses, the first thing people want to know is if the steak is good.  The steak here was very good (some of the best I've had).  Of course, a lot of these high-end steakhouses put out good quality steaks that are cooked to the appropriate temperature.  They tend to struggle with the other menu items though--the starters, sides and desserts.  Unfortunately, Carnevino is too similar to other steakhouses in that respect.Carnevino is huge and boisterous.  They keep the restaurant pretty dark.  The decor is nice and the seating is comfortable, but the overall look and design of the restaurant is nothing new (or impactful).  They do feature a large bronze bull statue at the front.The complimentary bread included cheese puffs that were good.  I cannot remember what other bread was served, but it was at least okay.I started with the big eye tuna crudo, which featured tuna sashimi dressed in a vinaigrette with a side of radish and cucumber salad.  The tuna was fresh and good though it was a very small portion.  Some of it was a little over salted.  The radish and cucumber salad was fresh and crisp.For my pasta, I had the fruit di mare, which featured spaghetti with a tomato sauce, lobster, squid, shrimp, and clams.  The seafood was a generous portion.  I liked the lobster and the shrimp.  The squid was fine.  The clams were just okay; I've had better.  The clams here were not as meaty and tender as I would have liked.  There was a little bit of grit and sand in some of the shellfish though.The tomato sauce had a little bit of heat to it, but it was quite thin, watery and bland.  The waiter said that all of their pastas were housemade, but the spaghetti did not taste like housemade spaghetti.  Maybe it was, but I have had better housemade spaghetti at other restaurants.I tried my friend's pappardelle dish, which was served with mushrooms.  We both agreed that her pasta was a little bland.  The texture of the pasta was good though.  I was not a fan of the pastas at Batali's Osteria Mozza (though the pastas there were not bland but salty).The main course was good though.  I had a bone-in New York Strip and it had a great char to it.  The inside was nicely medium rare.  It was juicy, flavorful and tender (which is hard to do with a New York Strip because it is lean).They also offer a dry aged bone-in ribeye for two people.  This ribeye gives new meaning to the word bone-in (check the photos on Yelp to see what I mean).  The ribeye was huge and they carve it tableside.  The ribeye was very good--great marbling, juicy, flavorful, and tender (one of the best steaks I've had).I also sampled a little bit of the filet portion from the porterhouse.  This was my least favorite of the steaks.  Maybe the filet was too thick because the center of it was kind of bland.They offer sauces on the side and I tried their wine reduction (Barolo Ristretto), which was oily and had no flavor.I did not get to try many of the sides, but I did try their creamy mashed potatoes (mixed with mascarpone and a poached egg).  The mashed potatoes were very creamy and flavorful.  The other sides sounded good.It was my friend's birthday so Carnevino made a big chocolate cake for the occasion.  The chocolate cake was rich and fudgy, but it was just okay.  We also had some of their gelato on the side (chocolate, vanilla and coffee).  The gelato was a little icy and lacked the creamy, smooth texture that is common with gelato.  The flavors were not that prominent as well.Service was good.  Food came out at a good pace.  We were a large party, but they had a large and attentive staff supporting us.  Before ordering at most restaurants, I engage the server to understand what are the most popular dishes and how are they prepared.  More often than not, I let the server direct me in what to order especially if I sense the server is passionate about the food.  Here though, the waiter was a little pushy.  As soon as we sat down, he was directing us on what to order, how much we need to order and so forth.  Service was still good, but the waiter was just not for me.Carnevino's meat was very good and unlike several Las Vegas restaurants I've dined at, I walked away satisfied.  Prices here (like other Vegas restaurants) were pretty steep, but at least I felt that the main food here (steak) would match up well with some of the other very good steak places I've tried, which makes Carnevino a good Las Vegas option for steak lovers.By the way, my friends said they saw Mario Batali (he was eating with John Cusack near the bar).The Palazzo has complimentary valet parking.  I would imagine like other major casinos that they have complimentary self-parking as well.Chef Mario Batali should cringe that his name is associated with this restaurant. For Carnevino did not even deliver on the basics on our recent visit. First of all- this place has a high bar given all the talk about it and the prices that it charges. It was highly recommended to us so we decided to take our group there on our last night in Las Vegas. From the moment that we entered- the place was not up to a "fine dining" restaurant . . . .and trust me- I eat out alot. Our waiter had an attitude from the moment he walked over- wanting to know "who was in charge" and tossing menus and wine lists at us. We appointed a "person in charge" just because it seemed without it- nothing was going to move forward. Everything we asked for seemed to be an issue for this waiter. We wanted several appetizers to share for the table. He wanted to know exactly how many of each versus just figuring it out as a good waiter would. Two of us asked to split a steak and to have it sliced- he acted like it was huge imposition but we saw it being done at other tables in the place. Our wine sat unpoured on the back table until one from our group got up to pour the table some wine. Pouring our own wine? Really? At a fine dining restaurant? Unheard of. At this point- I called the manager over- but she was not very helpful other than getting our water glasses filled. I expected to her to minimally check back with us before we left to see if things had gotten any better.  But she didn't.  She didn't care either.Our salads came up and were so bitter and salty that they were inedible so we sent them back. The pasta dish we ordered was no better than "Chef Boyardee". So far- service and the food were untenable for a fine dining restaurant. The best thing of the night? The steaks- but it takes a lot to mess those up. They were done perfectly and were quite tasty. But at $54 a steak- I would expect nothing less. This service debacle went on for 2.5 hours and at the end when we received our $1100 bill you can bet that the obligatory 20% tip for our server -who was terrible- was put right on there. Hard to believe.There was no other compensation from the restaurant for the bad service other than they didn't charge us for the salads we didn't eat. Plenty of good restaurants in Las Vegas. Too bad this isn't one of them.We chose Carnevino for our fancy dinner out during a recent bachelorette party. We were happy to find that they were able to accommodate our large group (8 girls) for dinner, but were a little paranoid when they told us they'd charge us $50 for each person that didn't show up. They were also really persistent about checking up on us in the days leading up to the dinner - maybe they have a lot of experience with flakes in Vegas?Anyway, we were immediately really impressed by the space. It's dim and romantic and very upscale. They put us in a semi-private little nook which I liked because we were still able to see out into the main dining area but still got some privacy. I have to say the service here was excellent, though I wasn't so impressed with the food. Our waiter was really helpful in determining how much we should order and making recommendations, though I did get the impression that he was trying to upsell us. If we ordered as much as he suggested we would have been too stuffed to walk after our meal! However, he took it in stride when we ordered only some of what he recommended. The meal started with some tiny little complementary cheese croquettes, which were a small bite and very savory and tasty, as well as a bread basket with choice of butter or lardo to spread on top, which I thought was a nice touch. To start, we had the grilled octopus and two of their salads. I enjoyed the arugula salad with a triple cream cheese but the other starters were not so memorable. We also went with the ribeye, which was yummy but to be honest nothing special compared to other steakhouses I've been too, both expensive and more affordable. We also weren't super impressed with the pastas we had - a black fettucine with crab, a gnocchi and orrechiette with sausage and broccoli. They were all fine but definitely not memorable (I just had to look up the menu on the website to recall what we ordered!) To be honest, the highlight of the meal was the side of mashed potatoes we ordered, which comes with a poached egg and some sort of bacon type meat. It was so indulgent and rich! But I was a bit disappointed that the mashed potatoes were the highlight of this extravagant meal. Though I was totally impressed with the ambiance and service, the food unfortunately didn't measure up for me. With so many wonderful restaurants in Las Vegas, I don't think there's time to waste on mediocre expensive meals!***Carnevino is expensive, but the meat choices (like the New York Strip and veals chops) as well as the grill octopus and lobster ravioli are very good***While I am not a big fan of Las Vegas restaurants, Mario Batali's Carnevino definitely excels at putting out great meat dishes.  We had several of their meat offerings including the bone-in New York Strip and the veal chop and both were very good.The bone-in New York Strip was a thick cut and it had a great crispy outside sear, which was flavorful.  The meat was very tender.  It was undercooked at rare, but it still had a good flavor (and was of course moist).The veal chop was better.  It was also very thick, but it was cooked more appropriately.  Veal chops should be between medium rare and medium and this one was.  The meat was moist and tender while the outside crust was distinct and flavorful.  Veal can often be a tad bland, but this one had a good flavor.  This was probably the best veal chop I have ever had.The lamb chops were just okay.  Unlike the other meats, the lamb chops were not that thick.  They were a tad overcooked and while they did have a decent flavor and were tender, they were just not as juicy as they should have been.  Also, the outside crust was not as good as the veal or the New York Strip.We had two other dishes that were also very good.  One was their grilled octopus.  I've heard Batali's grilled octopus at Osteria Mozza is very good.  This one was exceptional.  The octopus was very soft (which can be difficult with octopus) and it had a great flavor.  There were some good pickled vegetables on the side and maybe something else like prosciutto to give it a nice savory flavor.I have not enjoyed many of Batali's pastas, but I did like his lobster anolini.  The lobster filled ravioli was very good--moist with a great lobster flavor.  The cream sauce was mixed with tarragon and it was flavorful and fragrant without being overly buttery or rich.Most of the other items were in the just okay range.  The arugula salad featured a triple cream, but the triple cream was surprisingly dry and a little hard.  The bruschetta was okay (as was the big eye tuna crudo).We had the pappardelle with porcini mushrooms and while the pasta sheets were good, the pasta went cold quickly.  It was also a little bland.  I was expecting the braised pork agnolotti to have a more impactful filling, but it was not as moist or savory as I was hoping for.  The garnish of chanterelles was good though.  There was a little bit of butternut squash on the plate, but it did not provide the sweet flavor I was expecting.Most of the sides were just okay (like the spinach and the roasted beets), but the mashed potatoes with mascarpone and a poached egg were rich, creamy and quite good.I had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and it was okay.  I am not the biggest fan of flourless chocolate cake because it can be too dry.  While it was a little bit dry, it had a good (but maybe not great) chocolate flavor.Service was good.  The staff was attentive and the food came out at a good pace.Prices were high (which is common in Las Vegas), but when you share several of their dishes (family style), you might be able to save a little bit of money.Carnevino has very high ceilings and a loud atmosphere.  The place has the look of other expensive steakhouses--kind of masculine looking with lots of dark browns.The meat at Carnevino is very good and it is up there with some of the best a la carte steakhouses I've tried.  I am not the biggest fan of these steakhouses, but Carnevino is one of the better ones and they even have a few other good things (like the lobster ravioli) to balance out the meal.Carnevino is located in The Palazzo, which has free parking (valet or self).HAPPY and FAT. The operative words that come to mind when I hear the name Mario Batali. Sadly, the overpriced, lackluster fare at Carnevino only made me the latter! But, as a disclaimer, it has been quite a while since my visit here, so hopefully they've made some improvements since then. Located in The Palazzo, Carnevino semi-failed from the get-go. While it maintains the top-notch customer service and decadent, chic decor expected of a high-end Vegas establishment, the ambience was marred by the raucous sound of Beastie Boys blarring from the stereo system. I'm not neccessarily opposed to them, but the likes of "Intergalatic" and "Sabatoge" didn't jive well with the up-scale environment.  The menu was sneaky too. So, watch out! Case in point, the prices listed for the pastas range from $17-$31; however, these are for appetizer portions only. An additional $15 needs to be tacked on for the entree size. Also, the steak for two is listed as $72, but it's $72 PER PERSON, making it a whopping $144.  A steak legitimately worth that much wouldn't be for eating, as it should be plated in precious metals and embedded with Swarvoski crystals.We ended up ordering the Bison Carpaccio & Fried Calamari appetizers, 16-oz bone-in New York strip, Grilled Sweetbreads, & Pork Milanese. Pretty much all the main courses failed, and for an establishment that boasts "the highest-quality, excellently prepared steaks" I was seriously expecting more than the the chewy, bland New York strip that was served. The appetizers were actually pretty good, and I'd recommend getting the Bison Capaccio. But other than that, the highlights of the meal were the complimentary cheese puffs & the bread w/butter & peppered lard. Needless to say, this was a sad way to start out our trip in Vegas. Luckily, our night of debauchery at XS later on that night made up for it. Two stars!Even my MOM was impressed with Carnevino...and that's a high standard to meet.We came here with a group of 7. The GM came out and personally greeted us at the hostess stand when he heard our party had arrived. They had a beautiful table set up all the way in the back of the restaurant (through the wine cellar room, which I thought would have been a cool place to sit as well). With very high ceilings and paintings on the wall, the back room felt like we were in someone's old world castle. It was quiet, romantic and I loved the ambiance. Needless to say, service was absolutely impeccable. Some of us started with bellinis. The chef also sent out some complimentary apertifs. Our food order was massive:Appetizers:-Caprese salad-Stracciatela (proscuitto and mozz)-Grilled octopus served over octopus sashimi (my FAVORITE, the grilled octopus really was perfectly prepared and so tender)-Steamed clams (the broth was soooo amazing)-Lobster with the tail served sashimi stylePasta:-Garganelle bolognese (Because I was craving some sort of spicy pasta I requested the bolognese sauce to be made spicy and the chef added a very nice amount of heat)-Orrechiette -Beef agnolottiEntrees:-Dry aged bone-in ribeye (for 2 people) this thing was massive, I will upload a pic. We took the gigantic bone home for my Mom's teacup malteses. So spoiled.-Filet mignon-Lamb chops-Bison (available on their special menu)*Note that the meat prepared at Carnevino is prepared a little less than requested. For example, if you request medium rare, it will come out closer to rare.Sides:-Spinach-Mashed potatoes-Butternut squash-Cauliflower gratin-Porcini mushroomsI tried little bites of everything. We were all so full that dessert could not even be considered. The service and food were absolutely outstanding and I can't wait to experience Carnevino again soon.What a joke. I must preface my review by saying that I'm not accustomed to eating at restaurants like this, where prices are so high you need to mortgage your house just to have dinner. But I was vacationing in Vegas with a large group of friends and this is where they wanted to eat. So I gave it a shot!One quick glance at the menu and I knew I was going to break the bank. I took a moment to map out my game plan and decided on ordering the ravioli plus a side item so my wallet wouldn't take too much of a beating. My wife, also alarmed by the prices decided to order the gnocchi and a side item (quick recap, with a little wine we're way over $100 at this point. ouch)My first red flag should have been when the waiter pointed out that the "ravioli" was actually a "raviol-o" - as in singular - as in just one piece of ravioli - as in what the hell? I scratched my head. $25 for 1 ravioli?? The price must be wrong or it must be a huge, delicious, giant, thick piece of ravioli. I asked the waiter to describe it and with his hands he made a rather large circle. So I assumed it would be a decent sized dish. OK I'll order it.HA! 45 minutes later (yes 45 minutes) I was served the tiniest, thinnest, smallest ravioli you have ever seen. It was roughly the the size and thickness of a ritz cracker. 1 cracker. for $25!! Then came my "side item", also rather small. I wish I had a stopwatch at the dinner table - it took me about 45 seconds to eat everything. Roughly 3 spoonfuls and I was done!My friends (all of whom have large bank accounts) ordered many dishes. I was shocked at how small everything was. A a spoonful here, a tiny dollop there, and somehow these "dishes" were worthy of $50 price tags. I just sat there in disbelief. I sat there watching other people eat because I had already blown my $100 on my single ravioli and my wifes pasta. In the end our bill came out to roughly $200 - for two people who basically ate nothing and drank a little wine. It was so bad it ended up ruining the rest of my night. I was not a happy camper and while everyone else went back to gambling I grabbed a slice of pizza at the hotel (delicious, i should have eaten there) and went to my room to watch tv. Look - I understand that there are lots of people out there with money to burn who like to live that way - they're willing to spend $50 on a tiny scoop of pasta because the restaurant is "exclusive" and has a big fancy chef's name attached to it - but give me a break! My "raviolo" didn't even taste good! It had almost no flavor and my side dish tasted microwaved. My wife said her gnocchi was fine but she had tasted better pasta at small chain restaurants back home. My wife summed it up best when she turned to me at the table and whispered: this is the most pretentious place I have ever been to in my life.0 stars if I could.Things have changed a bit at Carnevino since the first time I went.  It's still a top notch steakhouse but if and only if you come in prepared and knowing what to order and not order.  I've had the pleasure of dining here a few more times and this is what I can say for sure:- Only go if you're ordering the riserva (call ahead), the dry aged bone in ribeye for 2 or the Florentine porterhouse for 2.  I usually go with the ribeye.  Sure it's more than the usual steak but no one should be coming here to pinch pennies.  Which leads to my next suggestion...- Don't be a cheap ass.  Outback is at Casino Royale next door.  There's nothing wrong with being frugal but your experience won't be good if you're trying to do it here.  - The sauces are a waste of time.  You don't need it if the steak is awesome.  - The filet mignon quality has changed since they opened and I don't think it's worth ordering anymore.- Think of the pasta as an appetizer to share among friends or just a pricier side dish.  They are not dinner entree portions and don't bother ordering it if that's your plan.  B&B is just on the other side at Venetian and you'd have a better experience there.  That being said, I REALLY like the Ricotta and Egg Raviolo with brown butter and get it almost every time I go.  The Spago is excellent as well.  - What's even better than great meat for an entree?  Great meat for an appetizer!!  The PROSCIUTTO DI PARMA 'RISERVA' is heavenly.  One order is good for 4.  - This isn't a very romantic spot.  The music is mostly rockin and the tables are positioned a little weird with that middle section making you feel like you're dining in a hallway. God bless Mario Batali!!1) Wine took 30 minutes to get to the table2) Waiter was more interested in himself and did a poor job representing the menu.3) Plates left on the table too long.4) Steak was bland and had no flavor,  I asked for A1.  Do not believe the hype.  This restaurant did not live up to the reviews.  I rather eat a Slim Jim than pay for a tasteless $70 steak.One of the most unique steakhouses in Vegas offering a rare culinary delight:  MONTHS aged dry aged beef.Read on, I promise not to talk about what the process really is.Called "Riserva", the once USDA prime beef is aged six to 11 months before being trimmed and served.  The result is unlike "younger", 30-75 day dry aged beef.  The shorter aged steaks retain a beefy texture, very tender with a pronounced nutty, bleu cheese aroma and flavor with a massive umame finish.  The months aged beef, think prosciutto.  Broiled rare to mid rare at a low temperature.  There is no thick outer crust.  The flavor is mild and nutty with only the hint of bleu cheese aroma.  The beef is dense and oily.  It has a very different mouth feel.  It is extremely sweet.  Amazing but not for everyone.Tip:  Request the "Riserva" steaks when making reservation.  The amount of aging doesn't matter.  The piece is selected when it has reached the correct characteristics.Traditional dry aged steaks are excellent.  The rib eye and porterhouse both possess the classic umame packed dry aged goodness.  Excellent sear, tender and juicy.  Both steaks are meant to be shared.  If dining alone, both the bone in New York strip and Bone in filet mignon offer the same experience as the porterhouse in a more manageable 16oz portion.All steaks are rubbed with rosemary before cooking.  It imparts a strong, woodsy flavor that enhances the sweetness of the beef.Not into aged beef?  The 20oz bone in veal chop is excellent.  Natural, pasture raised veal, it has a light beef flavor with a soft texture.  It's dry rubbed with thyme and porcini powder that imparts a very flavorful earthy goodness.  A drizzle of fresh olive oil adds the perfect richness.For starters, the fried calamari, "Shrimp alla Diavola", and Bucatini Amatriciana are excellent but why fill up.  You can get these at Batali's Italian eatery, B&B Ristorante.The restaurant captures the spirit of Italy, an enjoyable, casual, jovial evening.  Don't go with an elegant stick up your, you know.  The bread will make your hands oily and gnawing the bone is encouraged.Bravo!I guess I'm simply getting tired of the hype steakhouse / Vegas Hotel over priced lets put a top shelf name on the door charge exuberant pricing then deliver about 25% of what it is worth.  One of the most disappointing meals in a very long time. 9 Of us for dinner this evening for my birthday and we are seated nicely in the external wine room with a large table.  Asethically pleasing our sommellier gives us some reccomendations from this 500 Plus wine list that is so completely and utterly over priced I can't even begin to believe they have the balls to charge some of these numbers.   OK high rent Palazzo hotel you go with the flow.  A nice Pinot Noir and Super Tuscan are selected as we await our waiter Shep.  Some friend bread with cheese is presented along with some very nice hot bread with a variety of butters.  Bread has a rosemary type garlic topping very good.  Unfortunately this is where the majority of the meal goes down hill.  Multiple appetizers ordered Shirmp Ala Diablo $19.00 1 giant shrimp with a piece of italian bread in a spicy marinara sauce.  Specia Beef Cheek ravioli with a cream sauce topped with a drizzle of balsalmic vinegar was different.  An Angoltti was then presented with cream & mushroom..  other end of table had very nice Big Eye sushi tuna cut very thin told fresh.  House salads were ample not lacking in flavor. Entrees. 3 Veal Chops 2 cooked perfection 1 so fatty it was sent back and taken off the bill $85.00 each for a veal chop good but certainly not $85.00 worth and thats ala carte.   How can you serve a fatty $85.00 chop though? ....  Rib Eye steak again massively overpriced ok but nothing special.  Two veal dishes with musrooms were ICE COLD and had to be sent back.. Came back hot next time but so quickly can't imagine they weren't just nuked.  Pasta with assorted shellfish was fresh if not bland and a bone in Fitlet migon was probably best thing on table.  A non bone in filet and $40.00 lobster tail again COLD you really have to be kidding here. Side dishes were in short aside from the garlic mashed potatoes a complete and utter disappointiment from the fried eggplant, to spinach with hot peppers BAD.Nice zeppoles and whipped cream for the birthday boy for desert.   Service was on but they simply coulnd't handle how busy they were.  Goes to show you, put branding on anything and you can sell Ice to Eskimos.  2K with tax and tip when all was said and done, it I have to be honest this was truly an untter and complete disappointment.  Probably worth 2 Stars but with these price points, a veal chop going back, two veal dishes ice cold, a lobster tail and filet cold for all the Zagat ratings, all the clippings and my fellow yelpsters I DO NOT UNDERSTAND all the high rankings.. This is a DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY place that will never see us again.I am really baffled by all the hate for Carnevino in the reviews. I first came here about 5 years ago when I cam to vacation in Las Vegas and have been back probably 10-15 times since I moved to Las Vegas. I always go when people are in from out of town and want a good steak place so I have been with about 20-30 different people. Never have any of us gotten a bad item, had bad service, or not loved it. I am a unapologetic fine dining snob and until Gordon Ramsay Steak opened this was my favorite steak restaurant in Vegas- and for the steak itself it is probably slightly better than GRK (GRK has better non steak dishes and desserts). I can't wait for someone else to visit so I can try the new beef tasting menu. The restaurant comes from Mario Batali (orange crocs) and Joe Bastianich (the mean judge on amster chef). If you have been to any of their other restaurants Carnevino is similar in many regards- formal fine dining atmosphere, similar slowly paced service, the waitstaff likes to talk etc. This isn't for everyone- some people just want to order their food and have it delivered in less than 10 minutes without a lecture on Italian after dinner drinks (Grappa by the way is an acquired taste- I almost gagged the first time I had it but now I love it). If you do go to Carnevino give yourself at least two hours and have a backup liver waiting for transplant. The SteaksUsually I would start with appetizers but let's be honest- you are here for a giant slab of meat.  Here are the steaks I have had ranked in order1. Bone in ribeye for two. This is carved tableside. If you like Ruths Chris serve your steak at 1500 degrees sizzling deal you might not like this as it is served more room temperature- and if it is warm at all the heat quickly goes away from the thinly sliced meat. It is very tasty though- the seasoning is very light so its all beef taste.2. NY Strip- not usually one of my favorite cuts but I have gotten it a few times for variety and it is better here than elsewhere I have had it.3. Bone in Filet- superior to the boneless IMO- has the very soft texture and less beefy taste you expect from a filet. Now, not always, but most of the time, they have a special steak that is aged longer- if this is available for the love of all that is holy get it. Pay whatever they ask- 100$ a pound, 200$ a pound, your first born- whatever it takes. These steaks taste like nothing you have ever had or likely will have again in the future. They have an almost blue cheese like flavor that is incredible. I have had plenty of expensive food that I would say was not worth it- this is not one of those. Non steak Items- I have ordered a few of these - pork chop, Osso Buco, and they are great- if you are a local and can come here frequently I highly encourage you to try them. If you are in from out of town though, you probably just want to get a steak or you will return him and find yourself lying awake in bed, filled with regrets.Appetizers- there are quite a few beef appetizers. You can go two ways with this- some people will find beef on beef on beef to be too much- we call them French. So if you are worried about your blood test results get something else, if you love America here are some suggested Apps (not all of these are beef but are meat)1. Carne Cruda- raw beef good. 2.Prosciutto di Parma and Affettati Misti- picking between these two is slightly harder than Sophie's Choice3. Beef Cappallacci -this has some really strong goat cheese which is amazing but may knock your socks off. 4. Anolini- lobster pasta- whats not to loveHow could one not be a fan of Carnevino?! It's amazing! The food was excellent, the service was excellent, and the drinks were flowing. If you find yourself in Vegas craving a really good piece of meat, and have an overflowing wallet, this is the place to go! While the prices were a little high for my tastes, our traveling buddies wanted to take us here. We definitely enjoyed our meal, by far it was amazing. I sampled things I hadn't before, and it was all around enjoyable. The service was excellent, many different servers stopped by our table for different things, and each was extremely professional and friendly. I absolutely loved the corn side dish, it was by far my favorite. I also LOVED the potatoes with the egg (who woulda thunk?), that was amazing. The steak was great, if you have the budget to spend.I finally had the chance to join four others and have dinner at Carnevino.  We have heard so much about this restaurant from Michael U.  He set up the dinner with the staff at Carnevino.We started with some cheese puffs and then we were each given a nice roll.  With the roll came to spreads, lardo and butter.  The lardo was superb!  Fatty, salty, and just the right accompaniment to a tasty roll.Seven appetizers were next up served family style.  The items were grilled octopus with pickled vegetables and limoncello; carne cruda--their made to order chopped steak tartare; pastrami slices with two fried eggs and some greens; stracciatella; two wood platters of cured meats--one with mortadella, salumi, coppa, lomo, and nduja and one with prosciutto; and a dish of peppers, some stuffed with cheese.  With the appetizers, we got some sliced, toasted bread and some more lardo.  There were also more rolls brought to each person.Next up we had two pastas--beef cheek ravioli topped with sliced white truffles and gnocchi with fresh cut figs.  Next was the reason we were there--meat, in particular, their Riserva, a dry aged meat done in a way no other restaurant is.  Our two inch slice of Riserva was aged 254 days.  We also got a veal chop and a ribeye that was 100 day aged.  After showing all three meats on the table, they were cut table side and then placed back on the table.  With these meats, we had five vegetable dishes--mashed potatoes with an egg that was mixed into the potatoes at the table to make them creamier and tastier; Brussels sprouts, eggplant parmigiana, sautéed spinach, and thick cut garlic fries.The meal ended with four desserts.  We had some cheesecake, panna cotta, a chocolate, peanut butter torte, and semifreddo.The star of the evening was the Riserva.  The flavor is hard to describe.  There's a small bleu cheese flavor but the flavor comes from the oils from the fat that are in the meat.  We were warned to eat some of the ribeye first and then move on to the Riserva.  The difference was remarkable.  The appetizers and sides were good.  The vegetables should have been hotter.  Perhaps they were waiting too long while the meat was cut.Service was outstanding.  Our waiter, Shepard, was on top of everything and he had a great personality that made dinner a little more special.All in all, a special evening with some friends enjoying some good meat.  A return visit sometime is a must.Vegas is a city of decadence, and if you're staying at the Venetian, Carnevino is a pretty good place to splash down your cash. It's fancy and expensive, with a lovely upscale ambiance and top notch service. The carne and vino are excellent.I went for dinner with my family during a weekend stay at the Venetian. There were six of us, and we sat at a comfortable tucked-away table that felt like a luxury poolside cabana looking into the rest of the opulent dining room. Service was on point. Our waiter Corey was friendly and attentive, and he took really good care of us. The sommelier was also helpful. We asked her to recommend a wine and ended up getting a magnum of Barolo. It was a wonderful wine, perfect for our meal, and it came in the largest decanter I've ever seen, which the thin sommelier hefted around like a champ.The food was delicious, actually much better than I expected given the Yelp reviews. I thought Carnevino was on par with other Batali restaurants, and I love me some Batali. Our meal kicked off with complimentary cheese bread, soft warm puffs packed with flavor, along with some crusty rosemary ciabatta rolls served with butter and lardo. We then shared a neat spread of appetizers. The best of these was the grilled octopus with pickled vegetables and limoncello. This was some of the best octopus I've ever had, tender and meaty, firm without any toughness. There was some nice heat to it too--I think there were some Fresno chiles in those pickled vegetables. The prosciutto di Parma "riserva" was great to share, a large platter of silky prosciutto ribbons, served with sliced apple. We added gnocchi fritto, these fried bready pillows, to eat with the prosciutto, and they were lovely. We also shared two pastas, which became appetizer-sized when split six ways. The beef cheek ravioli was tremendously good. Delicate triangles of pasta came stuffed with a rich, hearty filling of beef cheek, all served in a butter sauce drizzled with 20-year balsamic vinegar. This dish is a Carnevino and Batali signature (I'm pretty sure I've seen and coveted it...Iron Chef??), but it is technically off menu. Your server is sure to mention it, but if not, it's worth an inquiry. The orecchiette with sweet sausage and broccoli rabe was also fantastic, the thick, toothsome ears of pasta in a satisfying tomato sauce.For the meat of our meal, we ordered both of the large format steaks--the dry aged bone-in ribeye and La Fiorentina, or classic Florentine porterhouse. This was a real feast, with both steaks carved up and served on enormous plates. Both were cooked a beautiful rare medium rare, red velvet with a seared, seasoned crust. They tasted different from each other but not in a way I could describe well, even at the time--they were both juicy and perfectly cooked, and I couldn't state a preference for one over the other. Just bring everyone you know and get both. We also ordered a couple sides--the charred brussels sprouts and the mascarpone and guanciale mashed potatoes. These were tiny sides, definitely sized for individuals, but we each all got a few bites of each. They were great. The sprouts were nice and roasty, with a pleasant brightness from the lemon zest in the gremolata. The mashed potatoes were rich and creamy, laced with face bacon and a poached egg.We were pretty stuffed by the time dessert came around, but we rallied and split a couple between the six of us. The chocolate peanut butter torte was a dense, gorgeous slice of indulgence, served with peanut brittle and salted caramel sauce. The gelato and sorbet was a great way to end the meal--we got lemon curd gelato and tangerine and blood orange sorbets, all citrusy, light, and not too sweet. About what I want after a whole lot of steak.This was an expensive meal (most of it was comped, courtesy of the Venetian's love of Asian gamblers), but probably worth a splurge if you're looking to eat and drink well while on vacation. It's hard to beat good steak and wine, even harder to beat good steak, wine, octopus, pasta, etc. I'd love to come back to Carnevino, and will keep it in mind next time I'm looking to go big in Vegas.What a fancy, upscale restaurant! The atmosphere, the service, the food....they were all so great.Before I continue, I ordered one of their pasta dish. Yes, I know. Who comes to a steak restaurant and orders pasta?? But to each their own....I was simply craving for pasta that night. Either way, it did not disappoint. Order the Linguini Fini (crab, jalapeno and cipollini...aka onions with a jalapeno pesto sauce.) Sauce was light but flavorful. And let me tell you: portion control was great. The dish was small enough to still get you full without feeling like gross and bloated walking out the restaurant.Boyfriend and I also ordered a kale salad to share as our appetizer. If you're a fan of kale, you must get this!!!!! Very refreshing.For his entrée, he ordered something that was not on the menu. He knows the chef really well and they prepared it special for him. Zucchinis with tomato sauce and cheese. Sounds simple but man was that good!? If I'm ever in the mood for something healthy, that is what I will go for.Dessert: Peach & Blueberry Napoleon. House made ricotta, blueberries and sauce with a layer of canoli crisps. Not usually a fan of dessert but wow...it was delicious and light.Let's start with the name.  Carne = meat and Vino = wine.  Yes please.   Needed to find a special restaurant for a birthday we were celebrating in Las Vegas.  As a fan of Mario Batali's restuarants in LA, I didn't hesitate to book a reservation at Carnevino, especially since we were already staying in the hotel.  In Las Vegas, its always easier to book experiences within the bounds of your resort.  Easy to do at Venetian/Palazzo.  Our dinner was absolutely amazing, and I'm referring to the whole experience, not just the food.  The restaurant is elegant and the service was on point.  We had a team of servers doting on us all night.  The food though, was heavenly.  Their steaks are truly extraordinary; dry-aged on site, then rubbed with sea salt, black pepper and fresh rosemary to achieve tenderness and signature flavor.  The menu also offers all kinds of beautiful homemade pastas, salads, and side dishes all inspired from Italian street food.  But trust me, this is no street food joint.  The menu is rich and sophisticated, with prices to match.  The meal is served family style.  I was one of a party of four.  We ordered two salads, two steaks (as recommended by our waiter), two sides- mashed potatoes and spinach.   This was entirely too much food.  The steaks were HUGE. The "charred dry-aged rib-eye for two" easily feeds four!  The "dry aged bone-in NY strip for two" could have easily served four as well.  We would have been fine with just one steak between the four of us.  **Beware! They do a hell of an up-sell here.  The waiter had suggested we order two appetizers and two pastas, in addition to what we ordered!  Here we are, four LA girls, and this guy's pushing food for eight hungry men returning from sea.  Really?  (insert irritated face here).** Having recently eaten at Bestia in LA (another fabulous Italian carnivore den) and mistakenly followed the waiters suggestion, I knew that was too much food!  What's the deal with these types of restaurants and the food up-sell?  Its annoying.  Even cutting his suggestion considerably was too much food!  I considered knocking off a star for this, but overall, this place is definitely first class, so 5 stars it is!  Oh, I should mention that the cocktails and wine were fantastic too!  We had a fabulous time at Carnevino.  This was definitley a dinner I will always remember fondly.Bookmark this one friends, for the next time you visit Sin City. xoItems Selected:Corpse Reviver #2 - Broker's Gin, Lillet, Cointreau, Lemon Juice, Pernod RinseGougeres with GorgonzolaRosemary Rolls with Lardo and Salted ButterCrab Stuffed Squash Blossom with lemon, cherry tomatoes, mascarpone Carne Cruda Alla Piemontese - chopped to order steak tartareDry Aged New York Carpaccio with horseradish, caper, beet relishVeal Tongue in Brodo with pureed parsnip, radish and lemon Fig Salad with Bitter Greens, Marinated Onions, House BaconBeef Cheek Ravioli with aceto balsamicoTagliatelle BologneseGluten Free Pasta with crab, jalapeno and cipolliniFried Eggplant with tomato & ricottaMascarpone & Guanciale Mashed PotatoesGrilled Corn with Pickled Peppers and Lime240+ Day Dry Aged 2.5" Riserva Bone-In Rib Eye90+ Day Dry Aged Bone-In Rib Eye Lamb Chops 'Scottadita' - 3 Double Chops with Sea Salt, Lemon Zest, and MintPork "Osso Bucco" with Sauteed Spinach and GremolataDouble Espresso on IceRoyal Tokaji Co. 5 Puttonyos 2008Chocolate Bourbon Budino with nutella cream and cherry jamApricot Poppy Seed Cake with dindarello raspberries and candied walnuts Balsamic Cheesecakewith figs and pine nut brittle Bowl of Fresh FruitAmaro CartA tradition coinciding with the Olympia each September for the past few years, it was with seven friends both new and old that another exquisite meal at Carnevino took place on Saturday evening, all the old standards including a particularly funky Riserva Rib Eye proving every bit as excellent as ever while a few new additions including some crafted for tablemate battling diagnosed Celiac Disease showed the versatility of Nicole Brisson and a kitchen staff willing to go above and beyond the call of duty to please.This time forgoing a private booth in favor of the lower ceiling intimacy of a back-room linking the two major dining halls, it was again with superlative service that matched professionalism to a (much needed) sense of humor that a four-course degustation bookended by far-too-many adult beverages was passed, a total of four-plus hours ending with TooL's Lateralus blaring loud enough to be heard on The Palazzo floor as the Chef herself sat tableside sipping Barolo while discussing topics entailing restaurants, criminal justice, and more...No doubt a night that will be long be remembered, not least for the food, anyone lucky enough to have taken a seat at Carnevino will realize that the primary focus of the restaurant is its BBL Beef and featured in versions chopped, cured, cooked, and raw it was both the carpaccio and veal tongue in Brodo that offered new glimpses of the Beef Tasting menu, the former so thin that "melts in your mouth" was expressed by more than one at the table while the texture of tongue was smooth and delicate, the pureed parsnips virtually indistinguishable from potatoes a la Robuchon in texture with slightly sweeter taste.Impressed by the crab-stuffed blossoms in rice-flour as well as pastas that show Brisson's years in Italy, as well as those with Batali, to have been well spent it was by two more meats that steaks were accompanied and although a trio of fatty lamb chops were as rich and gamy as expected it was the gluten-free presentation of pork shank that nearly stole the show away from the Riserva, each tender bite shredding to gentle fork pressure with flavors reminiscent of the slow-cooked pork steaks made  years ago by my grandfather.Generally going lighter in pastries at Carnevino than elsewhere in part due to the group, but also as a result of the substantial amount of food ordered during prior rounds, it was with three desserts plus a bowl of fruit that the meal found its ending, the creamy budino with cherries and semi-savory cheesecake outperforming a poppyseed cake that seemed to have suffered a bit from drying past midnight, though a great glass of Tokaji and complimentary education in herbal digestifs made such a small thing quite forgivable.*****Certainly not an 'everyday' meal in terms of both cost and calories, Carnevino remains in a class of its own amongst Las Vegas Steakhouses, the product and execution from Brisson's team on par (or better) than any found to date in the nation.
Blue Wasabi Sushi & Martini Bar=Okay here's what happened...I walk into the restaurant around 3pm and the very friendly hostess, seeing that it's just two of us, asks if we wanted to just sit at the bar. My friend does all the talking and soon we are sitting at the bar. This is when my first experience went to the crapper. The bar tender was the worst server I've had in a while. When we first sat down she was so pushy about the drink menu kept pointedly asking what we would like to order - when we finally just asked for water she basically ignored us the rest of the time except to drop off our menus for our food. We didn't get our water until maybe 10 minutes after sitting there and we never got a refill. In fact after she took our orders - with the most disgusted look I'd ever seen - she didn't stop by after that to check up or to see if the food was good. When we were finally served our sushi (she didn't bring it to us) we were missing a whole order but she never stopped long enough for us to explain to her. What I don't understand is how she stayed so busy because let me tell you, there was NO ONE at the bar. We finally had to flag her down for our check and even asked to get more water after we got our check. I realize that we were sitting at the bar and so I'm sure she was bummed that our tab wasn't going to be as high since we only ordered water. But you get paid on service and I am still mad that she was tipped at all. She was a nasty doofis, with a muffin top and saggy boobs and if she ever wants to make enough off tips to buy support bras she's gonna need to attend a few more customer service oriented classes. Food wise I was not impressed with this place at all. Is the seaweed supposed to be slimy? I will definitely give sushi another try, but I wouldn't go here.
Dong Phuong Saigon Bowl=09/07/10Came here on a coworker's suggestion.  He made sure I understood him when he said it was a dive.  Yes, Bill, I get it.  Once that was out of the way, he then said that this is where his family went for good noodles at least three times a month.  He's right- SB doesn't have much of an atmosphere, and it soon became clear that the majority of their business was in takeout sales (many were college students or middle-aged males).  So busy in fact, that my simple order of crab puffs and combo (beef and pork) noodles took longer than I'd expected (20-25 minutes).  The crab puffs were actually decent-- I would've preferred a toastier look.  However, they were nicely crisped, and not too greasy.  That is, after I'd toss them over a few hundred paper towels.  The noodles were tasty, and I preferred the saltier pork over the sweet beef.  (If only the noodle dish I ordered at China Magic the next day was as tasty as this one was!)  Be sure to have someone with you to share, bec. this entree won't taste as good the next day-- the noodles dried up overnight in the fridge.
L'Auberge Du Dragon Rouge=L'auberge du Dragon Rouge est une institution ici à Montréal. Il s'agit indubitablement de l'expérience cullinaire et culturelle la plus originale de la ville. Des troubadours tournent autour des tables en nous délectant de leurs chansons grivoises et de leur bonhimie sans borne. Les prix sont très élevés mais le service, l'ambiance et la qualité de la bombance et de la ripaille, comme on dit là-bas, font de cette coûteuse dépense une expérience à recommencer.
Amuse Bouche=Lovely little restaurant, lovely little surprise.  What a nice way to have lunch after a day of exploring out west.  Although small and in a strip mall, once inside you are in a charming red "bistroish "  cafe. The style is warm and the food is delicious. I  highly recommend the Lamb Panini  super good, moist  and flavorful. The Fish And Chips special was tasty too. The fish and fries both appeared to be beer battered .  Generous portions and great taste. Can't wait to go back.What a difference good customer service makes!!For my second visit I took my with daughter with me. I called before heading over to make sure they had room for us. The person who answered the phone was friendly, improvement right off the bat!When we arrived we were immediately greeted kindly & given an option of 2 tables that were open. The place was packed, but while our server was available, her co-worker took our drink order & got us started. Our server was WONDERFUL. Seriously :) The food was absolutely delicious. My daughter is a teen, & anyone who has teens knows that they are hard to please. I was a little worried that the menu would be a little too adult for her, but luckily that wasn't the case. She ordered the The Cabernet Burger with, what she calls, the perfect french fries :) , & I got the best Meatloaf Sandwich. To drink our server recommended a French lemonade to my daughter because I ruled out wine & she doesn't like dark sodas. The lemonade was a big hit :)The entire experience, like the fries, was perfect & we both can't wait to go back!After reading the "Best of Phoenix Awards", I had to try Amuse Bouche.  When I read the article and saw something about it in one of the Yelp talk threads I thought ~ "What is this, a French restaurant located on the west side that is actually good?"  Well I gave it two chances for my first visit was a 1-2 star experience and my second visit was better but not enough to raise my rating...  First experience ~ I wanted to try the "Best Quiche Lorraine in Phoenix".  What I got was a so-so swiss and bacon quiche that was runny and not evenly cooked.  The pie crust was exceptional but when I pointed out the runniness of the quiche to my server she stated "that's how it's cooked".  My quiche came with a side salad for which I was asked if I wanted some blue cheese crumbles on top and of course I agreed.  I did not know it was going to cost me an additional $1 for what should have been on top of the salad to begin with...  The salad was fresh, the candied pecans were good but the salad needed more dressing.  (see pic)Aside from the runny quiche the service was deplorable.  Loud 80's big hair band rock was coming from the kitchen area and filtered through this little "French Restaurant". My server did not know her menu and stated that my quiche was egg-less when I pointed out it was too runny.  My ice tea ran dry a couple of times due to my server and the cook eating in the kitchen.  It was somewhat gross because they were cooking other peeps meals while eating theirs... No hand washing in between, yeeuuh!  Second visit ~ I made sure no one in the kitchen area was eating and cooking at the same time.  I was also glad to get a different server this on visit even though I could not believe the other lame-o server was still there.  This server knew the menu very well and was very attentive with his service.  After reading the Yelp reviews I tried their Cabernet Burger.  It was more cabernet than burger...  You could not taste the beef and the caramelized onions made this burger too mushy for which the bun could not hold up to it.  The French fries were pre-frozen and were not good even with the onion aioli...I had HIGH hopes for this west side French Bistro but their food and service fell flat like a French Beret...It's a small world indeed. This is a family run business and this review is for the catering service and the incredible food and for the amazing owners, Snir and Kierstin Mor. Why do I say it's a small world? Well, Kierstin happens to be from San Ramon. Yep, of all the Bay Area, a San Ramon person catering the first night of Shiva in honor of my Grandmother in Sun City, Arizona and the restaurant is in Surprise. Small world indeed.Jewish rituals around death are to some very hard to deal with and can be very complicated. Due to the fact my Gram had been living near me for the past year but still had her residence in Sun City and due to proximity of the mortuary and cemetery and other factors, my Mom and I decided to use a caterer to ensure we had enough food for everyone who may come for Shiva( traditionally everyone who attends the graveside would attend) My mom still being a local had been to their restaurant and had contacted them when we knew my Grandmother's death was imminent. We were and still are very grateful that Snir understood without question that we couldn't give him a set date or time just a heads up and a basic idea of timing and what our needs were and where the Shiva would be taking place.How can one review the food for what gentiles would consider a wake? Well, my feeling is how could I not. I'm Jewish- I like to eat. I like to talk about food. I like to cook food (someday will get my groove back with this)- The food was seriously THAT GOOD. Snir and Kierstin were THAT GREAT and luckily we ordered more than needed as we ended up needing to serve the leftovers the following evening and it fed me for another couple of days. I can honestly say Snir made the absolute BEST quiche I have ever eaten and I have eaten a lot of quiche in my life. First of all, I am still amazed at how he was able to cater quiche that was so light, so layered and so perfectly executed.  I have dreams about this quiche (and due to the eating my feelings since my Gram's passing the dream part is no exaggeration). We also had 2 different phenomenal vegetarian lasagnas one with eggplant one with olives, a couple of different salads- one with kale and quinoa and one with candied nuts The dressing was amazing. The rolls were great and lastly the lemon bars (no left overs) and the pot de creme(too rich for my taste buds but everyone raved about them) were a nice way to end a hard day on a sweet note.   I will say that if I lived in the area and needed catering, this would be my go to caterer. I wished I could have had the opportunity to to their actual restaurant but I know that day may come. Knowing that the restaurant is in Surprise, I am certain that all of the chain restaurants around may overshadow the gem but I sure hope not. Toda Raba!We stopped in this small bistro while visiting with family in Arizona.  Based upon the Yelp reviews, I was intrigued and want to check it out for lunch.  First of all, it is very tiny, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amuse-bouche-surprise?select=T26UYP8c20EJZacTFySeFQ I'd say they could seat maybe 40-50 people max inside the restaurant and on the outdoor patio.  The lunch menu offered appetizers, salads, house specialties and paninis.  I decided to order one of the house specialties which was the Cabernet Burger. Wow, is all I can say about this burger.  I don't think I have ever had a hamburger flavored with wine before.  It was a half pound of red wine-infused beef goodness.  There was white cheddar, bacon jam and garlic aioli on the burger that just added to the awesome flavor.  It was very good.  Our table also decided on the another house specialty which was the Paris Baguette sandwich.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amuse-bouche-surprise?select=qTkDfiKalJ5zmmc4SQnIxg  Of course, I sampled this, also for Yelp reviewing purposes ;)  It was delicious.  It had Black Forest Ham, brie, Dijon aioli, hard-boiled eggs and tomato.  It was accompanied by a field green salad.  Lastly, we got the Black Forest Ham Panini.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amuse-bouche-surprise?select=f2sVvmOb3YfEOljygqSgBg  This was a very flavorful panini.  Upon tasting this, we almost thought it resembled a Monte Cristo because of the richness.  It had Swiss cheese, tomatoes and Dijon aioli on it.  I think what made all three of these things we ordered really terrific was the fresh bread they were all prepared on.  Service was friendly and helpful.  They were very busy when we visited and our waitress was tending to a lot by herself, it seemed.  I would have never known about this place, if it weren't for Yelp.  Glad to have found this little great hidden gem tucked away in shopping center in Surprise.
Teriyaki Madness=Mmmm! My kind of fast food. This is an awesome place for takeout or a quick meal. It never fails I always get the same thing. The Teriyaki Chicken bowl with brown rice and I add grilled veggies for $1. Sometimes when I'm feeling a little naughty Ill get a veggie egg roll too. The Teriyaki sauce is amazing, and they put it on light unlike most places that will drown your rice in it. This is an awesome healthier alternative to a typical fast food restaurant. You can always call in an order to be picked up in roughly 15 minutes. The service is always pleasant and my order has always been correct. I def suggest this place!
Fire + Spice=This was the first and last time I will visit this sunny establishment. Please let me start by saying don't be fooled by the name thinking you may get some spice in your meal when visiting this establishment. I would like to enlighten any potential consumers on the epic failure of the evening I just experienced. Failure number one, they had our reservation incorrect and multiple times mentioning that we had made the reservation incorrectly. Failure number two, your menu on-line does not match your actual menu. When you say you have Hatch green chili on the menu make sure you can actually serve it. Multiple times I asked about the spice and was told it was very spicy, and was disappointed at the lack there of. I am a lover of New Mexico green chili, so if you compare your food to it you shouldn't be light years off on the descriptions.Third failure of the night was dumping a full ice cold drink down the side of my leg and back of my pants. Not only was I upset at the fact you soaked my jeans, but then offended at the idea the server was going to get a blow dryer and dry off my pants. If I wanted to wear my jeans straight out of the washing machine, I would have done so but thank you to the service staff, they took liberty of doing that for me. So, you want me to take off my pants to blow dry them you say, failure number four. Epic failure number five was the sub-par meals that followed along with the "flaming" drink that is not worth ordering The food was by far the worst thing of the night, which compared to everything else would seem like nothing. If you think you are going to get food, turn around and go back home and eat a bean burrito.  After all that we attempted to salvage the evening with some humor, but then comes failure number six. When the bill arrives we were told that although the server dumped a drink all over me, nothing could be done to adjust the bill. It was just a little liquid as I was reminded by the server AND the manager. I wasn't looking to make a scene but when I stood up from the table, someone asked me if I had an "accident" (I'm 29 and housebroken). Even to this point, I was just annoyed. This brings us to failure number 7, when paying for the bill we presented our overly intelligent server a $50 visa card and asked her to run the card for that amount, and came back letting us know it was declined. In surprise, I look up the account information on my phone to only see of the $50 loaded on the card the previous day a $48 charge was in the transaction history for Fire and Spice. When we asked the server, she responded by asking if we had ever stayed in a hotel before and how there is an "incidental" charge which is why the card didn't go through. I asked for the manager at this point, who felt it was okay to tell me again that the bill was now being discounted because of the small spill on me. So after showing him the charge on-line he then got his second level manager. Oh boy, if you are in the mood for being told you are an idiot, this is the guy to talk to! Failure number 8. When you walk into a customer service situation as the second level manager in an issue, normally one would look to diffuse the situation and not escalate it. Not this guy, he enjoys full confrontation with customers. Not to mention he also witnessed the events of the night unfold and rather than offering to make the situation better, he chose the much higher route of saying that clearly our card was declined because there wasn't enough money on it even after seeing the transaction history of the card, with their establishment as the only charge. Nothing he said made sense and walked away as if we bothered him by asking for an explanation of the charge. So here's to you manager's of Fire and Spice at the Sheraton Hotel in Tempe, AZ.. keeping it classy and bringing in customers to make them feel warm a fuzzy inside. Beware hospitality is at it's finest in this establishment!  WINNING!!!!The menu selection got my attention to try this place for my monthly ladies' lunch (co-workers).  This place is inside the Sheraton hotel and in the middle of the hotel (openly) so you see all the busy traffic of people.  I ordered the AZ Steak Melt (shaved steak sirloin cooked and topped with asadero cheese) and regular fries.  The sandwich was ok, not much flavors.  The fries were good.  The service however was great.  But the food was just OK.The food here was nothing to rave about, but the service was superb, and eating outside by the pool under the hanging lights on a warm Phoenix night was awesome. Like I said, the food was just OK. I had a veggie foccacia sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was bland, and the sweet potato fries were slightly burnt. The waitress was really sweet and went in the back searching for sauces and things to make my food tastier and came out with a nice jalapeño aioli and some maple syrup for the sweet potato fries (try it, its great). I ate with 6 others, and they ordered a variety of things off the menu. No one was particularly impressed with the food. This was our second time here, and both times they were sold out of the duck tacos - the things everyone wanted to try the most. The waitress said they were probably going away for good sometime in the near future. We had two yelp checkins here, and were offered 2 free desserts (1 free dessert with the purchase of 2 entrees x 2) - woot woot for yelp check-in deals. We had the bread pudding and the mocha toffee mouse. They were both OK - combining small bites of them created a nice hot/cold dessert experience.What saved this place however was our waitress and the ambiance. Our waitress was just the sweetest girl, and genuinely wanted to take care of us, and she gets lots of bonus points. While the ambiance inside was nothing special, outside it was semi magical. The warm t-shirt weather night, the hanging string lights floating above our table, the blue lit swimming pool, red lit jaccuzzi, and the large gas firepit/fireplace behind us all created a sort of mystical pseudo summer tropical vacation experience (yes, in Phoenix). We may be staying at this hotel quite a bit, and while I'm not particularly excited about the food, I'll probably come back for the ambiance and the service.
Jardin du Cari=This is the St Laurent location of the family owned and operated Jardin Du Cari. Same bare bones decor as the rest, with maps and posters pinned to the walls, same delicious roti with pumpkin. The veggie roti with pumpkin is one of my favourite inexpensive comfort foods in town, I pick it up for dinner about once per week, and I get the man the goat. Make sure you get the hot sauce that usually comes with, and make sure you're a bit careful with it. I love spicey and am always tempted to slather this stuff everywhere because it's deliciously mangoy and lemony but it's also badass burn your insides hot. The perfect antidote if you've had too much of the hot sauce is the peanut punch, creamy and not too sweet or peanut buttery. Like an inexplicable number of places in the area, Jardin du Cari is closed on Mondays.
Crema Cafe=It's quite a drive from downtown so I struggle to make it over this way often, but finally made it happen because Crema. After ordering up at the counter, we settled into our table and feasted on the cinnamon crumb coffee cake we snagged and mmm was that sugary goodness. We had planned on just tasting it then taking the rest home, but yeaa that did not happen. We finished off that piece of cake pretty quickly. With such a tasty start to the meal, we waited eagerly for the rest of the food. -scrambled eggs with sweet potato hash and whole wheat toast-an egg white fungus scramble with whole wheat toast and greens-a scramble of the day with whole wheat toast and greens-one blueberry almond pancakeThe toast was griddled up in butter, the greens were dressed, and the pancake was studded with blueberries. This was quality breakfast food. Throughout our meal, I was eyeing a little girl slurping on a very vibrantly purple and delicious looking smoothie, so I will be checking those out in my next trip. I've also seen pictures of the crema oatmeal and know I need that in my life soon. To be continued.
Wildberri=I'll start off with the old saying "You Never Get A Second Chance To Make A First Impression" Please read on.I dove and hour to get here! I was so excited to find another tart yogurt shop!Decor is minimal but tends to follow the same theme as far as these types of places go.I order a small tart with strawberry and kiwi (see pics) It had a nice creamy texture but not quite tart enough , I though the first couple of bites were tarty but then it just died off. Low and behold tell tale sign of cheapskateyness and robbing the customer was the hollow center of my yogurt (see pics) I really hate that and this is the biggest hole so far.My daughter got a small tart no toppings or so she thought, mid way through eating she uncovered ..............a pickle hair, pube, short and curly, whatever you want to call it. What a monumental Vomit Factor came into play here, did this have anything to do with the creaminess? UGH! He apologized and refunded our money and assured us it was too short to be his hair. But when you think about How does a pube accidentally make it way into a frozen yogurt batch? A bug maybe , but a Pube No Way!!I don't think I'll be driving outta my way to go here again.
TJ's Steakhouse=Solid steakhouse, slightly dull ambiance.I had the classic steakhouse meal: some mildly-genteel Cabernet, Caesar salad, petite Filet and baked potato. The baked potato is GINORMOUS, so I shared with my date -- and it was plentyfor each of us (and I have what's politely called a "healthy" appetite).Everything was great. The Caesar wasn't fishy, the steak was fabulous, and the potato was...a potato (pretty hard to f*ck THAT up!). Prices were as expected: my date ordered the exact same thing as I did, but with a second glass of wine, and the total bill was around $170.  Since steak is steak, let's talk atmo: is there anything that sets this apart from every other steakhouse in Vegas? Well, it's SOLIDLY unpretentious, which earns it big points in my book....but the ambiance is kinda dull. Dim lighting, boring furniture, and not much in the way of decor aside from giant black-and-white photos of past stars who have performed at the hotel. The one over our table was of Miss Ann-Margret...but was mislabeled as "Charo" (!!!!!!). Overall: if you're staying at the LVH, this place is fine. But I wouldn't call it a destination steakhouse.
Feast Buffet=2.5 STARS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT $15.99 DINNER    Following hours of hiking up in the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, I decided to make the Santa Fe Station Feast Buffet my post - hike supper. This review is testimony that I should of picked one of a hundred other restaurants for dinner. I have a frustrating relationship with Feast Buffets. Sometimes they are rewarding dinners in Boulder Station and Red Rock Resort Feast Buffets or poor experiences in this Feast Buffet for example. This is my second time here in person and the first time as a Yelper. My first experience was around 2009 before the remodel. I attempted to try it in 2012, but in the 24/7 City of Las Vegas they shut down at 9:00 on Saturday night.   There was a moderate line to pay for the buffet. Nothing like the lines I have stood on at Red Rock, Sunset, Boulder Station, or Green Valley Ranch Feast Buffets. The $15.99 plus taxes brought my Saturday night special dinner to $18 before the tip. The deal was there was nothing special about this Saturday night special that was advertised steak and seafood night. There was zero value to the meal. Unless I was missing something I failed to find a seafood station. The only seafood I saw was the live shrimp scampi at the Italian foods station. Where was the peeled shrimp? I really dislike the steak and seafood gimmick that many casino operators use to jack up the price.    In general, there was a poor selection of food. Right off the bat I could tell a good buffet from their Asian foods station. I can assert that their sister property Boulder Station has a far better Asian foods station with at least double the selection. In reality, $18 brought me a couple of bowls of wonton soup, cabbage based vegetables  (where is the description of the food?), chow mein noodles, rice, wonton soup, shrimp scampi, cola, coffee, and desert. The food lacked flavor just like the coffee. I only took a few sips of the coffee and said, "forget this." Finally, the sushi that Red Rock Feast Buffet (similar price) features is nonexistent here.     A hardworking yet unfriendly woman served my two colas, cleaned the table, and served my coffee.    There are two compliments that I will bestow this Feast Buffet. First, the Halloween presentation of the pastries was neat. And second, I appreciated that the wontons are in a separate bowl from the broth. A major complaint I have in regards to their sister Feast Buffet at Sunset Station is that they frequently run out of the wontons.    Based on my experience of paying close to $20 for a gimmick steak and seafood night, I have to rate it 2.5 stars. If I return on a night when it is $9.99 and get value, I might pen a review update. In conclusion, Station Casinos is their own biggest problem. A few miles south on the 215, their Red Rock Feast Buffet offers far more at a similar price. Most likely I will return to the Red Rock Feast Buffet before I return to the Santa Fe location. In conclusion, Santa Fe Station Feast Buffet can feast on 2.5 stars.
BRAVO! Cucina Italiana=Just an update...I received a message from Bravo regarding my recent experience. They asked that I send them my email address. To my surprise, they sent me a $20 e-gift certificate! I thought that was a nice gesture...I'll be sure to use it : )
Hot Wok Mr Cook=Dude picked this up one night on the way home from work. They've been sticking menus in our door for over a year now, so it was time. We got . . . 1) Mongolian Beef with Fried Rice2) Quart of Hot and Sour Soup All of this came out to around $14.  Seriously some of the best fried rice around. Not too greasy. Heavy handed with the stir fried vegetables in the beef, which was great. No sauce overdose like that one corporate Chinese place loves to do. I wasn't expecting a whole lot from the Hot and Sour soup, but it was fresh and filling. Mix in some of that rice and Sriracha and you're golden.Can't wait to try out some of the other offerings.
Twin Creeks=I first heard about Twin Creeks from on of my coworkers.  He's a bourbon aficionado, having toured the Bourbon Trail in Kentucky, being a Maker's Mark Ambassador, and so forth.  Bourbon's become my drink of choice, and he recommended Twin Creeks for their bourbon selection.It was a Saturday night sometime near the end of January that I made my first visit to Twin Creeks, based on my coworkers recommendation.  I went strictly for the bourbon, so I didn't dine here during that visit.  What started as grabbing a quick drink turned into me staying at the Silverton till 4:00am; yes, the alcohol helped fuel that, but beyond that it was the people that made me stay.  The staff is very friendly and they care about their customers.  Jay is one funny guy, if you happen to meet him.  The bartender that night was Joey, who was also great for both cocktails and for anecdotes.  And finally the regulars at Twin Creeks helped complete the social experience; you could tell the restaurant is located in a locals casino, with almost everyone sitting at the bar being regulars.  I knew that this place was something special based on the drinks and the people; I just needed to come back here for the food.On a side note, there is a very good selection of bourbon here at Twin Creeks.  You ask for a list of bourbon's at most restaurants and they'll probably respond with Knob Creek and Maker's Mark.  Behind the bar you'll find bottles of Pappy van Winkle, Elijah Craig, Woodford Reserve, Russell's Reserve, AH Hirsch...they had a good selection to choose from.  You can get a snifter ranging from $7-$50 depending on the bottling, or you can go for one of their tasting flights.  I believe they ranged from $15 to $35, but don't quote me on that.  They had a basic flight, a rye flight, and a more expensive flight that included the Pappy van Winkle 23 year (bottles of that go for $275!).  Of course there are the cocktails!  Go for the Orange Creek: muddled orange, Peychaud's Bitters, Cointreu, and Woodford Reserve.  Your palate will thank you.I've since revisited this restaurant multiple times, once for a friend's birthday dinner in February, and the most recent being last night.  The food menu has an area for "Twin Creeks Classics" that includes four different cuts of Prime Rib, four seafood dishes and four meat dishes.  These 12 dishes come with a bread basket, a house salad and your choice of two sides (baked potato, mashed potato, mac n cheese, brocolini or asparagus).  The "Twin Creeks Classics" ranged from about $20 to $40 I think.  If you just HAD to have a side I would recommend choosing from this menu.  The other part of the menu is a la carte, with your entree being served on its own; salad and sides are extra.  The first meal I had here was the Prime 16oz New York Steak.  I ordered it with a side of mashed potatoes.  The steak came with garlic on the side.  This was an excellent steak that I would expect to pay twice as much for at another steak house.  The meat was juicy, cooked medium the way I asked, and every bite just begged you to take one more, no matter how full your stomach tells you it is.  Bits of garlic with each bite added greatly to the flavor of the meat.  The mashed potatoes were good; nothing extraordinary, but also not something that came out of a packet and was microwaved.  My friend ordered a cut of their prime rib (I forget what size), which was great as well.  This is good prime rib that you are paying much less for than say, at Lawry's.  For sides she ordered the asparagus and baked potato; if you love potatoes like I do, I would recommend the baked potato over the mashed.  I'm not a big fan of asparagus, but my friend enjoyed it very much.The second meal I had here was just last night, and it was just as good as the first.  This time I went for the Bourbon BBQ Bone-In Rib Eye, while my friend got the Scallops.  The rib eye was again cooked medium the way I had asked, and it was just bursting with flavor.  In addition to the excellent meat, the Bourbon BBQ sauce was light and had a delicious sweetness that complemented the rib eye without overpowering it.  Me being me, I got my potatoes mixed up and ordered the mashed potatoes again instead of the baked; again they were good but nothing special.  As for my friends scallops, those were TASTY!  I believe there were 5 scallops, each seemingly the size of a golf ball, served in a white sauce.  I couldn't place the sauce, but my friend mentioned light butter, maybe white wine etc.  This was another excellent meal that makes me excited for my next visit.I like me some bourbon, and I like me some meat.  This place delivers on both ends, with a fun staff and friendly regular customers that help make the experience even better.  Whenever I've sat at the bar, I've been there well past their closing time chatting with the bartender and other customers.  Everything about this place makes me want to come back, which I've been doing at least once a month.Curse you Anthony M for not sharing this place sooner!!Never did i know that the Silverton contained such a gem. Their happy hour deal is a dream come true. Going to go into my style of describing everything i rememberDrinksManhattan- Completely agree with Ken M that this drink is potent. Boozy yet has a very nice flavorful sweetness from the marmalade and honey mix.Dragon's Eye- Wasnt too impressed with this one. They pureed lychees as a main ingredient but it lacked a lychee taste which was what i was expecting. To me this kind of tasted a bit like orange sherbert.Tiramisu Martini - Wow! Tastes like a boozy version of the classic cake! Epic Winz!TapasMeatballs- The sauce is rather pleasant but the meatballs themselves were nothing to write home about. I'd skip out on this one next timeCalamari- Some good stuff! the sauce is balanced perfectly and the squid bits were big and meaty with light flavorful breadingStuffed Peppers- Quite nice, the same cheese is used in the stuffed mushrooms. The balance from the sweetness of the roasted peppers and the savoriness of the cheese pair very well. Stuffed Mushrooms- White button mushrooms stuffed with cheese then topped with another cheese. Epic Win.Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Dates- Holy...Dude....These things...Wooo...Order two of them cause they're divine. Bacony, chewy, with a sweet finish. The blue cheese is good tooSpicy Red Potatos- Reminds me of cajun tuna or albacore cept with potatoes instead of lightly seared fish Bacon Wrapped Shrimp- Shrimp? No this place dont use shrimp...The use Prawns. Big ol prawns wrapped in bacon. Cant go wrong with that.Appetizers off main menuCrab Cakes- Divine absolutely divine. The butter sauce is quite nice and the cakes themselves are flaky with crab meat.Shrimp Cocktail- WHOA!! The prawns are back!! Again giant meaty prawns with house made cocktail sauce. The prawns lay on a bed of jellied cocktail sauce and thin slices of candied lemon. SuperbThink i found a new hangout spot.It was Restaurant Week in Las Vegas, and Diane and I agreed that one of the best menu selections was offered by Twin Creeks.  Neither of us had ever been here before, so I made a dinner reservation, and a few days later off we went with another couple.  After my experience I was favorably impressed with all facets of this restaurant.I liked the way the dining room featured a rock wall as a backdrop, which alternated with changing lit colors that were projected between the interspersed rocks.  The other lighting in the dining area was muted, and the restaurant reflected a modern but comfortable ambiance, with banquettes and dining sections that resembled living areas rather than traditional booths and tables.Excellent Pretzel Bread and great Chocolate Rolls were fine openers.  A chocolate start seemed odd, but no one complained as we polished off these tasty bread products.  Onion Soup was excellent just choking with Swiss Cheese, and when cut open spilling broth over the sides of the white crock and onto folded fabric below.  And so was a buttery tasting Caesar Salad.Refilling of water glasses was a rare event, and I had to ask for that and cracked pepper for my Caesar Salad.  But otherwise the service was efficient, cordial, and professional.  Extra Pretzel Rolls and Chocolate Rolls were cheerfully baked for my party on request.  A tender 8 oz. Filet Mignon was a fine entree joined with a very tasty Demi-Glace, good Broccolini, and an ultra-rich and creamy Yukon Gold Potato Puree.  And, a Chocolate Molten Lava Cake with a Chocolate Ganache center, and Vanilla Ice Cream thrown in by the house for good measure, was so rich and decadent that I was barely able to finish it, and was later awakened during the night by sharp "chocolate pains" in my gut.  No wonder, with chocolate permeating the meal from beginning to end!4-1/2 stars overall!It was another visit to Twin Creeks, and the food was very good.  But this time there were a few glitches.  At 7:45 p.m., the restaurant was already out of French Onion Soup, which I had greatly looked forward to eating.  And, on the first try only 1 of 3 ordered Lobster Bisques was brought to the table for my party of 4.  Warm Chocolate Rolls were as great as before, and a request for more was generously answered by a bread basket wholly filled with a second batch of just Chocolate Rolls.  I scarfed down 5 of the marvelous beauties myself.  Egad!An included Dinner Salad of mixed greens, cucumber, red onions, Grape Tomatoes, and Parmesan Cheese with Bleu Cheese Dressing was very tasty.  My entree of Filet Oscar was good.  But the steak was noticeably cross grained and between medium and medium rare in doneness after being ordered medium rare.  And, while a generous amount of tasty crab and Hollandaise Sauce was supplied, the 4 asparagus tips on the plate were all extremely thin.  Chocolate Molten Lava Cake ala mode was lip-smacking delicious, as before.  For the fairly high quality of food and presentation provided in a comfortable but upscale ambiance, prices are quite reasonable here.TC deserves an update and star bump.We went back on Tuesday night during their 8-10pm HH. I was set on ordering the Tomahawk, but with Jieun craving steak and me not wanting to waste the HH opportunity, I let her order the steak while I picked several HH items. Here's what we enjoyed.* Calamari $8 ($4 during HH)* Prime Rib Sliders $10 ($5 during HH)* Lamb Chops $20 ($10 during HH)* Caprese $6 ($3 during HH)* 20oz Tomahawk Ribeye $36* Two TC Manhattans $10 each ($5 during HH)I had almost forgotten how incredible TC can be. Everything was excellent, particularly the caprese and the lamb chops. The horseradish sauce that came with the sliders was a perfect accompaniment. The manhattans were strong and tasty as usual. And damn. The house salad that preceded the delicious Tomahawk steak is one of the best house salads I've ever had.TC = Top-notch CuisineSuperior quality. Appropriate price. Superior service. Superior consistency. Great happy hour specials (8pm-10pm). I bring the most-important people in my life here.A) SteaksServing certified Angus beef that almost melts in your mouth: 8 ounce filet mignon is what I normally get, medium rare. Also on the menu is:   10  ounce filet mignon,      8 ounce filet mignon with Alaskan king crab legs,    14 ounce New York,   16 ounce dry-aged rib eye,    16 ounce Kansas City,    28 ounce Porterhouse,    and Prime Rib (16 ounce King cut, 12.ounce Queen cut)   ... plus the 14 ounce Tomahawk rib eye...  Accompaniments include lobster, crab, shrimp, .... Sauces of three varieties, toppings to dazzle Guy Fieri, potatoes, sides, vegetables....on and on... Plus other entrees including chicken, seafood chioppino, lamb, pasta, salmon, scallops... And on and on... The quality of the entrees is superior, be it the beautiful beef or anything else. Top-shelf quality.B) TapasThe tapas menu is very strong regularly priced at between $4 and $10, and discounted during happy hour. I've enjoyed: wedge salad, meatballs, bacon wrapped stuffed dates, calamari, and prime rib silders. Daily specials mix things up. The portion size is rather generous, and the price rather modest. Truly worthy of consideration of "best happy hour" for the tapas.C) Personnel and AmbienceStable personnel keep this restaurant at the top of my list for superiority. Not only does the staff recognize and bring joy to each and every guest (regular or not, reservations or not), there is obviously strong and effective leadership from the management, strong and effective training programs, strong and effective coworker collaboration and teamwork and most of all: employee investment and dedication. Whatever is being done in this fine dining establishment should be the role model for all training programs of fine dining establishments. This fine dining establishment deserves to be recognized as possessing a level of quality I have defined as "unimpeachable quality".  An "unimpeachable quality" is and should rightfully be hard to come by and Twin Creeks achieves the status of "unimpeachable quality" because of the people that work here, the quality of the food served, and the management of the business.Twin Creeks in Silverton Casino is among the best dining experiences for steaks and tapas in Las Vegas, in my opinion, and compared with other similar restaurants wins the contest on value and the superior management of the restaurant.This restaurant is about "nuance" and masters the art. Beautifully.Desserts I have (thoroughly) enjoyed are: Crème Brûlée, Black Forest Cake, Molten Chocolate Lava Cake and when you order coffee, what you get is French Press to share between you and 3 other people.Great wine list, too! And superior selection of bourbon!Reservations are helpful.I used to love dining here. In fact we would come here up to 3x a month and spend an average of $100+ but, not ever again. Don't use the restroom while dining here or you will be accused of running out on the tab, even BEFORE you get your food.  That's right folks, they had contacted surveillance to see where I went, then had security waiting outside of the restroom. Like I said I didn't even get my food until AFTER being harassed.  Very poor management for being so accusational. My husband and I dine out quite frequently as you can all see by my Yelp check-ins (in fact we don't even check-on to all places we dine at) but, never have we been accused of running out on a check. I'm so upset with Twin Creeks and will spend my money elsewhere. I recommend my fellow Yelpers to follow suit so they do not have to experience something like this.I fought the bone and the bone won!I haven't been to Twin Creeks for many years, so long it was before the renovation to its current setup.  I came here because some friends had a dining credit from a pull tab winner they had while here.  They mailed it to me from their home so it didn't go to waste.  The credit would have been better used at the Sundance Grill or the Mi Casa Cantina.I was seated promptly at a high top table that would hold four people and I had a good seat for people watching.  I was asked about bottled/tap water and then delivered the iced tea I wanted.  I had looked at the menu online and I had a question about the TC cilantro marinated rib eye.  Susan, my server, explained that it was marinated 3 hours and wasn't strong with cilantro.  That would have been OK with me if it had been longer and I opted to go with that.  For an appetizer, I ordered the seared foie gras.After a fair wait, a runner brought the foie gras.  There wasn't much to it, but you get what you pay for.  The foie was OK.  There is a blood orange gastrique on the foie.  It sounded funny but it works.  It's light and doesn't overwhelm the foie.  The sautéed mushrooms with it were good.Then came the steak.  I knew as soon as I saw it they had overcooked it.  I asked for it cooked blue.  It was black and blue which means they left it on the grill on each side to give it a sear which had the result of cooking the steak too much given its thinness.  I was not going to go through the whole take it back and do another one but cook it less so I just ate what I got.  The steak was poor quality.  I literally had to fight the bone to get some meat from it and I ended up tearing the meat from the bone with a combination right knife with a left hook fork.  I would have gotten the same or better quality if I bought a rib eye at Albertson's and brought for them to cook.  The steak was tougher than the Cubs, too!Along with the steak, I got the large yam for a side.  That was almost the best part of the meal.  The cinnamon flavored butter and the sweetness of the potato was quite flavorful.For dessert, I got the crème brûlée which was well done with a good vanilla bean flavor.Now that I've been back, I won't make a return visit.  I have an open Restaurant Week slot to fill now because this is off my list--permanently!
Pearl Sushi Lounge & Bomber Bar=Pearl for Happy Hour last night!The Beautiful Carin and I met our friend Cathy for drinks, small plates and sushi at Pearl last night, and we had a great time!We have been to Pearl a couple of times before, but not in the past 2-3 months, so time to review on Yelp!We sat out on the patio and had dinner the way dinner is supposed to be, we had several small plates, several different kinds of sushi and several martinis and sake bombs, and spent the better part of 3 1/2 hours doing it!The patio is the way to go at Pearl. The weather was great, the sound levels allowed for conversation, we got to people watch as the night went on (always fun to see everybody tuning up for a night on the town!).It was really a nice experience. The service was excellent! Pearl has brought on some new serving staff that clearly know what they are doing and how to work their stations, as well as bond with customers. And, one of the owners was part of our service team last night and that shows me they are clearly working to make sure that service is good, and improving.We had several different martini's...my standard vodka marti with a twist...well prepared, ice cold...yum! Carin tried the Deja Blue, and really liked that as well as the Cherry Bombs, and Cathy did the regular Sapporo Sake bombs (don't worry, kids, we were walking not driving last night;) ).The small plates were really good...we had coconut shrimp(2), bottle rockets, fish schticks(2), gyoza, karaage (2), as well as spicy tuna rolls, fake and bake, pearl necklace and captain crunch. All of the dishes were good...some of the sushi selections were more successful than others, but that is pretty much always the case, and everything got eaten! So, the $74 question is how much did all this gustatory excess cost? Well...that's right! $74! Pearl now has happy hour prices on a bunch of stuff all night long, and that makes happy hour into a happy night!Finally, the decor is pleasant, modern and comfortable, and we really like the girl in the pearls artwork...and not just because the girl in the artwork is the friend that we had dinner with, Cathy (yes, seriously...yes, for realz...no, I won't give you her number).Pearl is a comfortable and affordable place with friendly staff and good food. Give them a try!Saturday night and Pearl was turning customers away. They actually refused service to any more customers. Not because there was a wait, not because they ran out of sushi, but because they were short a bar-back and the bartender was slammed.The place was probably 75% full and the bartender was standing around, she didn't look even close to being slammed. I have never in my life been turned away from a restaurant because they were too busy, especially when they were not at capacity. I've been a waitress, a hostess, and my father owned a bar and restaurant that got so packed on Saturday nights that the cocktail waitresses could barely move through the crowd. I thought it was a horrible decision to turn people away. I've been overwhelmed by customers before, so I think I have the right to call bullshit on this. I worked at a bakery and coffee shop when I was 17 and constantly found myself alone during the morning rush. I took the order, made the order and brought it to the customers. I didn't turn people away!  I worked my ass off hustling and apologized sweetly if there was a delay. In fact, I even got complimented on how hard I was working by the customers themselves. The point, I didn't see one damn person hustling in there. If you are going to turn people away because the staff is overwhelmed, then I would expect to see some people hustling. I am so confused as to how being short a bar-back equals turning away customers.I will never go back to this poorly managed restaurant in my life. Just to be clear, I wasn't rude to the sweet little girl who turned me away because I knew it wasn't her decision, but the manager should have been out there explaining the problem with a little more diplomacy. If you are going to turn people away, then figure out the right way to say it so that they will actually come back. If I was the owner or manager, I would have done every job in the place trying to lend an extra hand so that I didn't have to turn customers away. I would buss tables and wash dishes if I had to. Maybe I'm a bitch, but I'm a bitch that knows how to get shit done. Whoever manages/owns Pearl- you do not. This message is for you:  Don't send your little baby workers to turn away customers. They don't know how to do it without pissing people off. Also, telling people that you are not going to give them service because you want them to get the service they deserve is a crap thing to say. You are not a fine dining establishment and according to some of your reviews your service isn't all that great. I guess I'm never getting the service I deserve because I'm never going back. What a disaster.I used to be a fan of Pearl until my birthday this year. I called a week early to set up a time that would work for the restaurant since we had a large party and never got a call back. Not once in an entire week. In fact, when I called for the 5th time to double-check that everything was set up, no one even knew what I was talking about even after I had called both the restaurant twice and Tammy (who I can only presume to by the owner) twice. In fact, rather than admitting they were the ones that dropped the ball, when I called the restaurtant the day of my bday (and also the bday dinner), I asked to speak directly to Tammy after attempting to get ahold of her for a week and she started off by screaming like an absolute lunatic into the phone. She called me a liar and said I had never called and completely cut me off when I attempted to say anything to her. Talk about knowing how to run a business...wow.Even still, I understand she probably had a lot  going on and we had a very large party, but that doesn't excuse her lack of professionalism or the complete disregard for any of my attempts to get ahold of her. The least she could have done was call me back to tell me one way or the other if they could accommodate us or not. She was beyond disrespectful to not just me, but also my mother who attempted to calm her down after she laid into me. She told her that because I didn't text her, she had no idea about my dinner plans. Really Tammy? After talking to your employees and giving them specific details in the beginning of the week and then personally leaving voicemails with you twice before calling your restaurant again? And not only that, but TEXTING you?! That's the most pathetic, asinine excuse for first off, telling me I never called and secondly, for running a business professionally. Bottom line: don't count on Pearl for any big events and don't expect Tammy to go the extra mile or even be enough of a decent human being to admit fault and try to fix the situation. Way to lose nearly 30 patrons in one night.I have not left a dining establishment as upset as I was when I left Pearl. The experience I had as absolutely horrible. I am not one to make a big deal about nothing and I, more often than not, give people the benefit of the doubt, but I can honestly say I was shocked and EXTREMELY furious after my visit. I bought a localdines certificate to go to Pearl and have been dying to try the place out. They have a great menu and it is in a fun location. The terms on the localdine clearly state that it is ONLY VALID MON-THURS. We went on Tuesday at 7pm, sat down,  I pulled out the coupon and was promptly told by the bartender "we dont accept those on tuesdays" then he walked off. Let me also clarify that while it was 7pm it was not crowded or busy. There was NO ONE else sitting at the bar with us. I waited for him to come back so I could show him that it clearly says on there that it is Valid ONLY MON-THURS. He then notified me that it was in fact NOT valid on Tues or Thurs because they have specials. I explained to him that we drove more than 30 minutes to get there and we could order off the main menu and not get any of the specials if that would be ok....He said it was out of his hands and he couldnt do anything and walked off. A female server chimed in that "there's nothing we can do to help you, its just how it is" then she also just walked away. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Not a SINGLE person was willing to talk to us and explain things or give us 2 minutes of their time. The customer service was absolutely ridiculous. I have NEVER been treated so rudely in a situation that I clearly had a right for clarification. Today 10/5/2011 I see that Localdines is featuring Pearl with the SAME coupon that clearly states VALID ONLY MON-THURS. Needless to say, I am making it a point to write a very appropriately rude review about this place. The menu looks amazing, many people have written reviews about the great food....I however, never had a chance to try the food because I couldnt get past the servers who made us feel like we weren't worth their time. Save yourself the snotty Scottsdale attitude and go to Ra, Stingray, Sapporo or Sushi Brokers....they will not only serve you good sushi, they will also be polite.
Ono Hawaiian BBQ=NOTE: [Every time you read the word "Groupon", you have to take a shot.]I've been here several times, but haven't felt the need to write a review until tonight's experience.  Let me preface, that most everyone's dinner was 4 to 5 star.  Everyone raved about the panko fried fish.  The food was exceptional, except for the fried shrimp, which was overcooked.Let take this step by step.  First, when my wife called, the woman who answered the phone was very rushed, and hung up on my wife as soon as she completed her order, but before she could ask a few questions.  OK, they're probably pretty busy, but they should know that they're going to turn off customers with poor service.I rolled up with a $20 Groupon in hand, and the woman working the counter (who presumably was the same woman answering the phone) let me know, in no uncertain terms, that the Groupon deal was costing her money (now I'll assume that she is the owner).She complained that patrons would tell her that the menu prices are too expensive, but that once the company offers a Groupon deal, the same people show up with a Groupon, and they usually have a line out the door.  Then she mentioned that the economy must be pretty bad for so many people to get in on the Groupon, and asked me where I acquired my Groupon deal.  I replied, "The internet".Trying to make her feel a tad better about this losing proposition, I reminded her that the benefit of the Groupon was to bring in new clientele.  She said that the deal does bring in a lot of business, but that she lost money on all that businessI replied that the payoff would be return-business, and she said something to the effect of, "Yeah, most Groupon people don't come back.  What about you?  Am I going to get your return business?"My plea to the proprietors of this location would be:1. Don't complain to the customer about the promotional deal they show up with.  If you must complain, then complain to the people at corporate who entered into the Groupon deal.  NEVER complain to the customer.2. Don't be rude to your customer.  I know if may be hard to hold your tongue, and you're probably really busy, and you're a little overwhelmed at the prospect of not getting compensated for your hard work, but you can pretty much ensure a customer wont return if you're rude to them.I think this location serves great food, they just need to get their customer service in order.  I want to see this business thrive, because I like their product.  C'mon guys, don't ruin it with poor, preventable choices.
Shucks Tavern & Oyster Bar=I used to love Shucks, and it was my go-to neighborhood bar. Back in the day, they had fantastic 2lb crab buckets for under $30. When people would ask me my favorite thing about Las Vegas, those affordable crab buckets would be part of my reply- mostly because you can order them 24 hrs a day. Crab at 3am? Why not?Those  days are long gone now. The menu has changed, the late night specials have changed, the bar staff has changed. They used to offer a great late night menu after midnight (pics posted) but no more, now it's just breakfast. There's two bartenders who work there late night, one is a darling, the other who is newer is so rude.The crab is now $9 for 1/2 a pound, which is  just kind of silly. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's only so-so. The tuna is previously frozen, which is what you would expect from a place like this and sometimes it's okay, sometimes it's inedible. The oysters seem to be popular but they're gulf oysters which really isn't my thing.I used to love this place and would come at least a couple of times a week, but no longer. I'll still drop in once in a while if the bartender I like is working. And it's still a great place to get seafood late at night, but for your bar needs? You can do better.Just had the worst experience at Shucks after being a long term customer. Arrived and took a seat at the bar, thought I would order dinner. Was promptly greeted and given a menu then asked If I would like something to drink. Ordered a drink and took a look at the menu. The female wait person went back to talking with her friend and play on her cell phone about THREE FEET away. Since I have eaten at Shucks many times, I knew what I wanted to order. The wait person continued to talk and play for another ten minutes. A short time later another customer arrived and took a seat next to the other customer. Now there are three customers sitting next to each other at the bar and the wait person continues to talk and play on her cell phone all the time ignoring me. I thought I would give it a little time and see if this waiter is interested in taking my order. After sitting again, three feet away from the wait person and never being given the opportunity to order dinner. I got up and walked out. That was fifteen minutes of wasted time. This female waiter has got to be the worst example of how to treat customers. She was more interested in her cell phone and talking with her friends rather than do her job.  My pervious experiences with Shucks over the years has been very good. Honestly, I don't know if I will ever return again.If it were possible to give zero stars after this experience I would give it negative stars.Fridays is the best day to come here- they offer daily specials, but Friday's choices are by far the best value. You can pick orders of crawfish, mussels, crab cocktail, or crab & spinach dip for a flat $5 each. And did I mention martinis are half off ($10 each down to $5)? And they don't halve the portions for the specials, we're talking gigantic, full orders, for minimal money.CRAB COCKTAIL: It's crab, the portion isn't huge but it's fresh and tasty, and you can't beat $5 (regularly ~$10?). Order one per person, or whoever gets their hands on it first is going to eat the whole thing.MUSSELS: Large portion, white wine sauce. Not the best sauce, but again, you can't beat the value for the price/portion. Easily a meal for one, and sided with a piece of their addictively-good garlic cheese bread.CRAWFISH: Available depending on the season, also sided with the bread. Not nearly as good as other places in town, though it isn't the easiest dish to find in the first place. Wouldn't get again, but it's not necessarily bad.MARTINITS: The "dirty shucker" is a classic dirty martini, done well but the Chocolate Salted Pretzel is the stuff of legends. See Lisa H's review for more coverage, but it's something you have to try at least once. Fridays, for $5, is the best night to do so.Service was friendly, and the bar is lined with TVs, making it a good spot to watch the game. Draft domestics were ~$4 while bottled specialty beers were about $5. In addition to all this money-saving awesomeness, Shucks is open 24/7!
Xtreme Sushi=I just love Xtreme Sushi! This time the chefs were different, since the normal chef/owner was his day off (he is our favorite).  However the chef we had was pretty good, a little slower than our normal chef but I am rating for quality of the nigiri sushi and the idea of AYCE of everything on menu (except sashimi of course and hamachi Kama) is fantastic! They only had 2 servers last night, but they did pretty well considering they were really and hectically busy. The restaurant was full and I noticed that they were forgetting someone's order, but obviously the customers patiently waited with out complaints.  They must be there for the same reason that we were, for the fresh quality of fish and AYCE of everything on menu! Appetizers:Fried Soft shell Crab - very good, crunchy and tastyFried Calamari - The BF's favorite, he is Italian and says that it's better than most Italian calamarisFried shumai and steamed shumai - I prefer the fried shumai than the steamedShrimp Tempura - love their tempura, this is when we noticed that the 2 servers were a little frazzled because it took a while for them to get our tempura sauce. I ate mine without the sauce and no complaints. Teriyaki Steak - The BF said that they put too much sauce, but the steak was really good.Baked Muscles - Oh goodness, can't have this without our sushi! I love the sauce especially when I slurp the muscle and sauce all in one breathe! It's so steamy hot and delicious!Nigiri Sushi -Yellowtail - Oh my gosh! We have never seen any chef take a whole fresh fish from the back and cut it how they are suppose to for Nigiri's. What a treat and pleasure to see! We ordered a total of 5 orders of fresh Hamachi and it was soooooo fresh and delicious! White Tuna - This is one of our favorites! It's so darn good that it just melts in your mouth! We had 4 orders.Red Snapper with slice of Jalapeno on top - We first discovered red snapper nigiri with the Jalapeno on top while we were in Cebu Philippines at our friend's restaurant. Ever since we fell in love and snapper with the spicy crunch of Jalapeno is just so damn good! We had 2 orders.Uni - I love love and it tasted so fresh and yummy, although my bf doesn't like it because of the texture.Surf Clam - This was okay, but I ate it anyway.Salmon  with avocado and smelt eggs on top - This was my BF's creation and I was so surprised how good this was! I even squeezed a little fresh lemon over it and it was awesome!! Smelt Eggs and Ikura - These were both good and fresh, when it is too fishy it's not so fresh but it was just right (we learned this from Japan)Unagi - It is as good as it gets, especially how they always listen when request for extra crispy.Salmon Skin Handroll - This is the only thing that was off. I guess it depends on the chef. It's usually crispy salmon skin, but he made it with the salmon meat and a little bit of skin which was not too crispy. Don't get me wrong, but it was still really good!Baked Scallops and salmon with Eel sauce and Siracha - This was my creation and it was really good! Amaebi with fried shrimp heads - Very fresh and sweet and a great combo with the crispy shrimp heads! I really wanted to try the rolls, especially because you can order half orders also with appetizers and nigiri! This is why I love Xtreme, because although there are rules, they don't disappoint me when I want to order little by little. Next time I have to try the special and Xtreme rolls in half orders, which comes in 4 rolls instead of 8!Still I haven't met your match, therefore I still love you Xtreme!This in my opinion is a top quality AYCE sushi restaurant in Las Vegas.  Even if it is really far from where I currently live in Las Vegas.  Driving out here is almost like driving back to California, you are near South Point Casino and M Resort.But if you are in the area, and looking to eat some of the very best sushi in Las Vegas, this is one of the spots I recommend you hit up.Pricewise, it is fairly reasonable.  $19.95 for AYCE lunch (until 3pm) and $25.95 for dinner.  Kids AYCE is priced at $11.95.  And you can order just about everything from their extensive menu (except sashimi and single orders on the regular items like uni, amaebi, etc.).The restaurant is on the small side, but the decor was nice. My friend thought it was better than Sushi Mon.Food was delicious, fish was fresh and fried items like calamari were baked just right (still moist and not overcooked and rubbery).  Service was pretty good for our group of 8. And we were not rushed or anything even though we were there for a good 2+ hours, eating, drinking, and eating some more.These are what I particularly enjoyed:* Teriyaki Beef (possibly one of the best in Las Vegas, perhaps a little sauced but the beef itself was great).* Calamari (prepared just right!)* Sushi Poki Salad (fish were fresh)* Fried Soft Shell Crab - so good we ordered seconds.* Baked Muscles - one of the better ones available in LV.* Uni, Hamachi and Super White Tuna - must have in my book.If you are in a large group, you will likely be automatically charged the 18% gratuity. Which is cool, since there appears to be no time limit to our AYCE dinner.If you have never tried Japanese food, this is the place for you to experiment with the sushi and other menu items. The option to order everything but the sashimi in the entire menu, is great for adventurous beginners to get a taste of everything and find out what they like or don't like.
Giorgio (Les Restaurants Amerique Ltee)=Surprisingly well-priced meals for a little restaurant in old montreal. Wouldn't rank it in the top for dining in old montreal since there are so many impressive restaurants around, but the food is quite good. Me and my friends love this restaurant because the meals are fairly cheap and its bring your own wine which saves a lot of money. Service is always great despite us being a bunch of uni kids. Also the menu satisfies everyone.
Cheeburger Cheeburger=With a name like Cheeburger times 2, you don't have to guess what their specialty is.  What most diners in the area don't know is that Cheeburger Cheeburger is actually a chain with over 50 locations!  Walking in, newbies will be surprised by the 50s-inspired diner atmosphere.  Their menu definitely takes some time to navigate, but you'll get the hang of it.Burgers - their main focus and what everyone really comes for.  You can have your meat cooked to your liking (medium, medium well, well) and in various sizes (5.5 oz, 7 oz, 10 oz, 14 oz).  Apparently, they have their own farm where the beef comes from.  What makes them over the top is the number of toppings available.  Things like sun-dried tomatoes, avocado, and artichoke hearts are only a sample of their 25 plus topping selection.  The Husband went for The Semi-Serious (7 oz) for $6.99.  With nine types of cheeses to choose from, he went for the Pepper Jack Cheese and a fair amount of toppings.  Melissa G. went for The Classic (5.5 oz) Wrap for $6.79.  She also added a few toppings too.If it's not meat you crave, portabello mushroom and veggie burgers and wraps are also available.  Salads are also hearty on the toppings with over 25 choices to choose from.  I went for the Portabello Wrap for $7.99.  They offer white or whole wheat wraps and you get a signature sauce to dip your wrap in.  My wrap was okay, perhaps there's so much stuff going on that it's hard to enjoy the actual taste of the wrap itself.We couldn't resist their "Famous Fries & Rings" and wanted to go for the "Best of Both" Basket, Regular order ($5.89), but the waitress dissuaded us by saying it was huge and we should really get a Half ($4.69).  Apparently, she underestimated our craving for fried foods, and we ended up ordering up another basket of fries (Small $2.59 / Medium $3.59 / Large $4.59).  We weren't too fond of the onion rings, but we did like the fries.  They also offer five signature sauces, so we did the Adventurous Flight of Three ($2.49).  Since two of us ordered wraps, we ended up trying all five - Creamy Cheese, Zesty Horseradish, Creamy Jalapeno, Sweet Pepper, and Garden Vegetable.  We overdid it with the sauces and maybe should have just chosen one for our fries.  They weren't anything special unfortunately.  But the real winner is their milkshake selection.  With over 378,00 possible combinations, you can build any kind of milkshake you want.  The waitress did point out that once you get past the three topping combination, there's an excess of syrup as most of the toppings are syrup-based. (So, be sure to ask the staff what toppings are concrete versus syrup.)  I went for the Oreo Green Mint, Cookie Dough, and Heath Bar combination and it was REALLY good.  The Husband went for the Pina Colada and Berry Berry combo and his was pretty good too!  Melissa G. has Chocolate Banana Peanut Butter with Reese's Pieces.  They serve them up in two sizes - Half $3.59 or Regular $4.99.  Service was okay, the waitresses were super friendly in the beginning but slacked off a bit as more business arrived and our section was left empty.  (We were seated in the back section, although they ended up closing it off and seating everyone else in the front.)When it comes down to it, we paid over $50 for dinner and that was not including tip.  Pretty expensive meal for a party of three at a diner.  For those who know what toppings to pick, you can get a better bang for your buck.  But if you prefer the no frills on your burgers, this place is not for you.  We'd go back for the shakes and fries, but not for the rings, burgers or wraps.Since I won't be able to make the UYE Cheeburger Cheeburger Challenge in July, I went there today for lunch to make a run at the "Pounder" Burger (20 oz).I ordered a Pounder with Jalapenos, Pepper Jack Cheese, & Mayo.  I passed on Fries or Onion Rings because I wanted to make sure I had enough room to finish this monster burger.The waitress was very friendly and the service was good.  It didn't take long for my burger to come out.I immediately attacked it and pulled an Adam Richman.....I ate as fast as I could to avoid my stomach getting full.  I was surprised in that I never had to stop....I annihilated the burger in less than 10 min.  Besides the occasional pause to add mustard, I didn't have to catch my breath.  It was easier than I expected.With the challenge completed, the waitress took a picture of me for the wall....there was another customer who completed the challenge in the restaurant, so he got his picture taken as well.The burger itself tasted ok....it wasn't anything great.  Maybe I ate it too fast and didn't get a chance to savor the flavor....I don't know.Will I return?  Yes, to give a regular burger, fries, onion rings, and shake a try.I was able to make the UYE burger challenge after all, but didn't participate in the 1 lb competition.  I was at a BBQ earlier in the day and since I completed the challenge last month, I didn't feel compelled to do it again.So, I decided I would give the Milkshake & Onion Rings a try.  I ordered an Oreo Cheesecake & Peanut Butter Milkshake and a Small order of Onion Rings.  The Milkshake was good, but it was too runny.  I like thick Shakes.  The Onion Rings were very thin and very, very greasy....didn't have much flavor either.....very bland.  Despite ordering the Creamy Jalapeno Sauce to go along with the Onion Rings, it didn't help it much.Overall, I had a good time with fellow Yelpers at the UYE, but the food was eh.Will I return?  Probably not....there are too many burger joints in town and this one is kind of far from my house.As soon as I checked in here I was tempted to go to the edit settings on my Yelp app to correct the spelling. Turns out that's how they wanted it. First off, do not plan on eating here if you have any kind of time restraint. We came on a saturday afternoon at about 12:15. We were expecting it to be packed since it was lunch time but the place was about 40 percent full. So we were thinking we should have enough time to get to our 2 pm appointment. Well, it took about 10 minutes before our server came over to take our order. Since it was our first time, we had some questions to ensure our order was correct.Since they are called Cheeburger Cheeburger, of course we were going to try their namesake. How it works is this. You select what size 100 percent angus beef patty. How you want it cooked (medium, medium well, or well). Pick your bun (honey wheat or kaiser roll). Pick your cheese (9 to choose from). Finally, pick your toppings (26 to choose from including peanut butter). Keep in mind that you can only have 1 of each topping and cheese for free. Any doubling there is an extra charge.So I chose a 1/2 Pound Serious Burger ($7.99) cooked medium with pepper jack cheese on a kaiser roll. For the toppings I chose lettuce. tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, pineapple, roasted red peppers, and chipotle sauce. I also added bacon for 99 cents because it is not one of their free toppings. The taste? It was just decent. The beef patty itself didnt have too much flavor. Im glad the toppings I selected all went together really good flavorwise. I ordered the half pounder because I realized that the price was only for the burger. No sides at all. I should of ordered the next size down because we ended up ordering a fries/onion rings combo to go with it.We got the medium sized Best of Both Basket (4.99) which feeds 2 to 3 people. This combination of fries and onion rings were just ok. The fries themselves were a little bit thicker than McDonalds fries but smaller than steak fries. The onion rings were really good. You can tell it was just freshly battered and deep fried because of the consistency of the crunch it produced. Dont forget you can add free toppings to these sides as well.My wife and older son orderd the 1/3 Pound Semi Serious Burger ($6.99) and chose their options as well.Service is pretty much the main reason why im giving them 3 stars. Everything seemed to take forever from the moment we received the menus. By the time we got the check to pay, it was already 1:30 so we had to leave right away.Some random info:They also have wraps, sandwiches, and salads that the free toppings apply to as well not to mention milkshakes that you can create over 1,258,000 flavor combinations from. Hours are everyday 11 am to 9 pm. They just opened a new location in Anthem (Basically Henderson) off of Eastern and St. Rose Parkway. Their biggest patty is 1 pound (20 oz before cooking). If you finish all of that you get to have your picture taken and put on the wall.Overall, the food here is decent but the really slow service needs some improvement. I can understand you cook everything from scratch since the place was only about 40 percent occupied, imagine having a full house. Then you definitely dont want to have any plans scheduled too close to a dining episode here. Im willing to try them again at a future date.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #195
St Viateur Bagel Shop=Je ne comprends pas la rivalité Montréal / NY avec les Bagel. En toute honnêteté j'm'en fou, je trouve que c'est s'obstiné sur des stupidités.  Récemment on avait un débat mon ami et moi sur : Qui fait les meilleurs Bagels entre St-Viateur et Fairmount Bagel. Je dois admettre en toute sincérité ne pas y voir de différences. La majorité des fanatique mange leur bagel avec du fromage à la crème et je dois admettre à mon tour que c'est pas quelque chose que j'aime. J'aime mieux le fromage de chèvre genre le Sabot de Blanchette bien croulant avec une overdose de jambon polonais. Sinon juste du beurre, trop de beurre c'est mieux que pas assez.  Je comprends le monde qui dit que c'est plus dur a manger que ceux de NY parce que c'est moins épais mais c'est surtout là que j'trouve que ça fait son charme, j'aime mes bagels vraiment bien rôti, parce que le côté dur et très cuit c'est mon truc. Le bon côté? C'est frais, pas cher, la majorité des restants de change nous permettre d'aller plus loin et d'avoir des bagels frais. Le vendeur m'a même dit, voyant que j'étais en arrière de la ligne et n'avait plus personne après moi...je vais te donner des bagel chaud si t'attends 1 minutes. Hell yeah! Je veux dire, directement sorti du four. Bon service, courtois et rapide. Cash seulement. C'est pas mal un petit commerce avec 1 fridge qui a du fromage a la crème, du saumon fumé et voia.
Le Cheval Blanc=The sparkling clean, tile-encrusted brewery of Le Cheval Blanc shown to me by the brewmaster after we had a couple of pints, doesn't produce much (its a six barrel system), but it certainly churns out fine beer to the taps of their dimly lit brewpub, embroidered in deep leather red, accented by steel and wood. Six CAD for a pint of a fine IPA (spiked with citron), well balanced, not too bitter, the citrus backed up by a judicious application of Citra Hops. Six CAD for an Imperial of cream ale; rich, filling, warming. Me and the brewmaster talk in broken French and broken English about our favorite wines and beers, foraging for morels, cooking large dinners for friends. Music plays softly; a back patio waits for the snow to melt. We go outside and smoke a Gauloise cigarette apiece, swearing against the cold (he in French, I in Arabic).  Its a nice moment; we speak of our beer and food, the failures of both of our nations  (Canada apparently sucks as much as the U.S. these days), of the loves and losses and pains of everyday life in a big city.  He wants to move to San Francisco, I want to move to Montreal. We both laugh at the improbability of either happening. I fall in love with the bartender, her boyfriend walks in, they share a lingering kiss. I fall out of love with the bartender.A quick shot of whiskey (on the house), and I have to move out, my ruddy complexion sophomorically optimistic in the face of a cold too profound for a man from San Francisco to comprehend. The bartender gives me a half-wave and a smile, I fall back in love.My mustache freezes in the winter air.
Vices et Versa=Pulled. Pork. Poutine.Someone back in the kitchen could be curing cancer, but I'm glad their brilliance is focused on food, because this shit is actually one of the best ideas ever. With a touch more of the tangy BBQ sauce, it might even be the best food of all time, but I think at this point it's going to have to settle for being just ONE of the tastiest treats I've ever tasted.The crazy thing about Vices et Versa is that even if they didn't have pulled pork poutine on the menu it would still be an incredible bar, first and foremost because they have beers for DAYS. There are 33 on the tap list (that apparently rotates pretty frequently), and they are all locally brewed and judging by the four or five I was able to taste, all delicious. I guess I'm not well-versed enough in Quebec microbreweries to recall all of them, but I did have one brew called the Peche Mortal (mortal sin) that was dangerously tasty. And there was some kind of fiddle party going on in the back room.I'm moving to Montreal.Ah, Vices et Versa! Tu parles d'un beau gastropub. La liste des bières locales et importées est la meilleure et plus complète en ville et leur menu de pub est vraiment bien pour un endroit qui ne spécialise pas au niveau restauration. Comme tout bon gastropub, ils ont des sandwichs, burgers, frites, poutines, etc. Le service peut parfois être lent, mais c'est seulement le cas lorsque le bar est rempli, ce qui est assez normal... amirght? Mais sérieux, le staff s'y connaît bien au niveau de la classification et des caractéristiques de leur sélection de bières et sont super sympathiques lorsqu'on pose des questions. Et, petit conseil d'ami : prenez conscience de la liste des bières en fût disponibles avant de poser la question de "qu'est-ce que vous avez en fût?" à votre serveur... La liste est vraiment longue et ce n'est pas la question la plus constructive. À la place, demandez dont de savoir qu'est-ce qu'ils ont dans une catégorie spécifique - genre IPA, lambique, ESB, cidres, etc. Ça va vous éviter de partir sur le mauvais pied ;)Finalement, en été, on y va aussi pour la terrasse arrière. Elle est toute belle, avec des belles plantes et des petites vignes. Ça fit bien dans le quartier et c'est un endroit parfait en une soirée chaude d'été avec une bonne 'tite frette à la main! Santé!
Cafe Rio=I wasn't feeling this at all.  We met up with a couple of friends and one said this was his spot.  My wife likes Cafe Rio a lot too.They're famous for their sweet bbq pork which would've been great..in a barbecue sandwich! The sweetness was too much and really weird in a burrito, even weirder in the salad my wife got.  I would just go with the fire grilled steak or chicken if I could do it all over.I also disliked how they wouldn't put guacamole in the actual burrito itself.  I was given a teeny, weeny scoop of The Incredible Hulk TV series colored avocado on the side.  That was gross.  Mexicant, Mexidont, Mexiwont.A couple of things save Cafe Rio from 1 star and that's the quality of the tortillas and the drink station.  Their fresh tortillas could possibly be the best by a Mexican fast food chain and the biggest reason I may give it another shot.  The drink station is bigger than the usual and includes horchata, limeade and various teas.
Simon Restaurant and Lounge=So I've been here a half dozen times now (not by choice mind you!) and the 2 star rating still holds. An example of how rude their servers are: I ordered a sushi platter described on the menu as "california roll, and tuna hand roll". I despise spicy tuna (I hate spicy things and hate mayo) so imagine my surprise when a *spicy* tuna handroll shows up. I explain to the waiter the menu says just tuna so I'd like a tuna handroll. He refuses, says I'm wrong, the menu says "spicy" and walks away. I have to freaking go grab a menu , show him the words "tuna hand roll" , and ask again for a new handroll before he goes and grabs me another one. UGHBesides the service, the food is just BLAH. Bland, expensive. I'm into the whole foo-foo lunch thing, but honestly Society Cafe at Encore does the whole concept far better. The surf and turf tacos for $17 are TINY. I got a filet mignon cobb salad today for $18. I order my steak medium rare. The salad is so sad looking and imagine my disappointment to find my "filet mignon" is 2 ounces or so of grizzly, tough, dark brown "steak". Hardly a filet mignon, definitely not medium rare, and for sure 2 ounces of steak over greens for $18 is a ripoff. The sushi is a step above grocery store sushi - yup, that's the best I can say for it. Rant over . Space is still beautiful but service & food continue to go downhill.This is a superb place to have lunch or brunch.  It's not cheap, so don't come in here with that kind of attitude.  It's a place to be seen in Vegas.  I've been here several times over the past few years and I always see a celebrity while dining.  Gawking is not cool, so if you're easily impressed with that kind of stuff, save the jaw dropping and drooling for the casino floor and nightclub.....this is not for rookies.Now, about the food.....it's very, very good.  Some of the dishes I've had over the last few visits:Farm Fresh Omelet (Mushrooms, Bell Peppers, Onions, Cheese, Ham, Spinach, $13)Black Angus Burger ($15)Grilled Cheese Sandwich w/Bacon ($14)Margherita Pizza ($14)The Grilled Cheese is excellent!  My favorite Grilled Cheese Sandwich in Vegas.  The Burger is solid.  When I feel like having breakfast at lunch, I'll go for the Omelet.....it never disappoints.The atmosphere is trendy and the large glass windows facing the pool allow a ton of natural lighting to come in and set a unique mood that you can't find in Vegas very often.Overall, it's one of my favorite places in Vegas.Return Factor - 100%SUNDAY BRUNCH:What a terrific way to spend a beautiful Sunday morning.  This brunch has it all from the character, atmosphere, unique brunch items and service.  I like how they encourage even the customers to come wearing pajamas.  We opted not to but we definitely will next time. To say I went over the top with the food is an understatement.  The fullest I have ever felt in my life and believe me when I say I can be a ridiculously gluttonous pig.  Even my wife who eats with me everyday was taken a back.  I was out of control. I did actually have as small as a dinner the night before in order to be as hungry as I could do get my $40 worth of all you can eat.  We started with the dishes at the self serve area.  There were 6 choices at the panini/sandwich/crepe station and we had 3 of them.  The super friendly and helpful gentleman manning the station suggested his favorite which was a slice of baguette grilled in some kind of honey and butter which was outstanding.  My only thought was that it would taste even better while being inebriated.  The crepes were just ok and could've been a little more toasty than spongy but that's just our preference. The sushi station was way above the average buffet sushi.  All the nigiri and rolls were made to order with the exception of Simon's signature crispy tuna which were amazing.  I had 8 pieces of crispy tuna and 8 pieces of salmon.  They also had a whole slab of smoked salmon layed out and I probably had 5 slices of that.The juice station!  I loved this.  Does any other restaurant offer this as part of the menu?  Please let me know if there is because I would be all over this.  Freshly squeezed fruit, protein shakes, vegetable juices, yogurt smoothies and I could have as many as I wanted to.  Damn, dude!  I must've had 7 glasses of various liquids.  I didn't partake in the extra alcohol deals since I didn't feel like being bombed and then hungover by 4pm.  But the deals were reasonable: $12 for unlimited Black Star beer or $17 for unlimited champagne/mimosa/bellinis or $14(?) for unlimited trips to the make your own bloody mary bar.  I would rather have them make my bloody mary since I would screw it up but it looked quite popular.And on top of all this great stuff there's the a la carte menu.  We had the french toast which I think was encrusted with Frosted Flakes.  It was crunchy, sweet with a soft center.  Genius!  4 different types of hash.  I generally dislike Hollandaise sauce but it was ok with the steak hash.  We also got an additional fill of protein from the egg white frittata which was packed with 5 different veggies including corn, onion and several peppers.  I was unable to finish the frittata due to the fact they must've used about 12 eggs in it.  Breakfast pizza is a must.  So wrong yet so right.  Topped with sausage, bacon, country gravy and other ingredients that make diets run and hide.  I inhaled it like a champion.  You've probably heard of the meat sweats but have you ever heard of breakfast sweats?  That's what I went through about an hour after the meal.  So much good food.  I am definitely going to pace myself better next time and will definitely do less carbs as well but everything looked (and tasted) so damn good!I don't have many regrets in life, but eating brunch at Simon is one of them. It was quite possibly one of the biggest wastes of money I've ever spent at a restaurant. Mediocre food along with mediocre service made for a poor dining experience at a place know for brunch. It's a combination of buffet style, where you get your own food at a buffet line, and butler style, where you place an order with your server and they bring the order to you.The Easter brunch I went to consisted of average paninis, sushi that was the equivalent of that found at the local grocery store, bruschetta, crepes, pastries and cereal.Of the higher-end items served butler style, the french toast with its crispy exterior was the best. Less than stellar items included the lobster havarti benedict that was sorely lacking any lobster. I saw a couple specs of crustacean between the bread base of the benedict. Continuing the disappointment were the dry ribs and even dryer jalapeno cornbread. The kid's pancake was dense and had an almost rubbery texture. Ham and roast beef was also available and as good as any you'd find at a $8.99 buffet downtown. Desserts were lackluster and even someone like me who craves sweets, couldn't stomach more than a couple bites. For the price we paid for a family of three, I couldn't help but think about all the other places -- buffet or a la carte -- that would have been much more satisfying.Simon says SUNDAY BRUNCH! Made a reservation for 6 on Sunday for brunch with some fun people. When I walked in I was walked to the table my friends we already sitting at. The waiter already had water waiting and some limes and lemons on the table, i wish more place would do that. He offer me other drink options but I just stayed with water. After everyone showed up he went through the menu with us. One side was what the buffet offered which included sushi rolls, paninis, bagels, fruit, shrimp, crepes, and smoothies. The other side was from the kitchen which included pizzas, benedicts, and my favorite the white trash. With brunch you pay 39.50 and get to order from either side. We were a little confused at first but figured out we were not being punked. All of food for 39.50, eat it now!!! So, first we orders some items from the kitchen and then go up and cruised the buffet area. I grab some pineapple, muffins, sushi, and bagels. I also ordered a panini. Headed back to the table with almost a full plate. What have I gotten myself into?!?! The sushi was delicious. My favorite was the crispy rice and avocado roll. They also had other option like spicy tuna, California, and shrimp. I also like the blueberry loaf they had out, it was moist and delicious. The panini i ordered was the honeycomb baguette, it was interesting. i think i should have gone with a crepe. After I demolished the buffet stuff our orders from the kitchen started coming out. My first and favorite dish of the day was the chicken fried chicken. Just like chicken fried steak but it was chicken with gravy and an egg on top. The chicken was deliciously seasoned and just enough. My friend ordered a pizza, it was okay. Not something i would come back for. We also ordered waffles, pancakes, french toast and even some egg Benedict with pulled pork. Everything came out pretty quickly. Near the end we ordered some ribs and they were layered with bbq sauce which was awesome. Then we were finishing up and he brought us COTTON CANDY!!! We demolished the first cup and then had him bring more. He brought 3 more and we were then playing with it and make cotton candy mustaches and even dipping it in our drinks. We had too much fun for brunch. So my recommendation are the crispy rice, chicken fried chicken, and cotton candy. Also, my apologies for no good pictures. The food was inhaled.Since Simon is closing soon, I needed to get here and try the famous Sunday brunch when the servers all wear pajamas and the food is abundant.  The brunch is divided into two parts--a regular bar area where you can take an assortment of rolls and other sweets, treats like fruit flavored crispy treats and large peel and eat shrimp from a large tub.  In addition, you can have a panini or crepe made and there are other goodies there, too.  The other choice is to order items off the menu that is part of Sunday brunch.I first got some treats off the regular buffet like spread, basically junk food--well let's say, food with lots of sweetness.  The winner here was the cake pop.  That was quite good.I had several items from the order menu.  The lobster havarti Benedict was great and the Simon French toast made from dipping the brioche into frosted flakes was quite good, too.The winner today though was a small baguette sandwich made with fig jam and bleu cheese.  With the baguette put on the panini maker, the cheese melted and the fig and cheese together was the best thing I had.Service was OK.  I had two different servers.  Coffee was not refilled until I asked and at one point I had three dirty dishes on the side of my two top high table.I'm glad I took the opportunity to go here before  Simon closes.
L'Avenue du Plateau=You know how people go on these awesome quests to discover all the best of certain things, mostly food dishes? For example, finding the best burger, the best pizza or the best taco joint, etc... Well, if you're making that list for Eggs Benedict, I think you may need a pit stop at Restaurant L'avenue in #Montreal.We snuck in before a 30 minute wait and grabbed the last table by the door in this ever so hip, yet a bit small restaurant. With only French menus, I did decipher a few things, but our lovely waitress in a hurry let us know that they are known for their Eggs Benedict. We ordered up 2 sets of Bennies, his with Montreal smoked meat, swiss, mustard and of course hollandaise and mine with mushrooms, garlic aioli, bacon and hollandaise. They arrived about 15 minutes or so later. Cold. Boo, but silver lining is that they were still some of the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had.That hollandaise sauce was superb. So light and airy, with hints of lemon, but oh so rich and creamy with the perfect consistency. The flavor combo of the mushrooms, bacon and garlic confit was heavenly and oh so different in the best way possible from the rich and salty bites of smoked meat covered in dripping yolk. If it was a tad bit warmer, the dish would have been unquestionably one of the best things I've eaten in a while. If this wasn't enough, the dishes were accompanied with perfectly seasoned breakfast potatoes and a skewer of delicious fresh fruit. I was stuffed to the gills by the end of this proper brunch and although Eggs Benedict are quite gluttonous, I didn't feel too heavy or guilty.So this leads me to why this review was not five stars. Our service lacked a bit, hence cold food. Not sure if this is a regular thing here, but they were severely understaffed. Granted it was a Monday at 11am and they were slammed, but with only 2 servers for the 50 people seated, I'd imagine that was why our food was cold. Another negative was that the coffee sucked, comparable to dirty diner coffee with the creamer packets on the side.The other dishes being served look magnificent and in a foodie city like Montreal, when there's a savage line on a Monday late morning, you know whatever they're serving must be good. Bonus: One of the coolest, if not THE coolest bathrooms ever. Worth the trip even if you don't have to pee.Oh good gracious THIS is the breakfast emporium! The breakfast menu is simply dizzying. There are so many variations of egg based dishes (regular or Omega 3 ), Eggs Benedict, Omelettes, Montreal Bagels, American Style Fluffy Pancakes, and Exotic Juices to choose from that my eyes were bulging out while attempting to make my mind on what to order. Thank goodness, on Saturdays, breakfast is served from 8am till 4pm.If you come during the week, you can also enjoy salads, sandwiches, poutines, hamburgers, milkshakes, martinis, steak, stews, curry, other pub fare!For over 20 years, l'Avenue is best known for their Eggs Benedict of which favorites are the Chorizo, Steak and Eggs or the 'Tout l'Monde à Poële' variations. I went for the third option. Wow, the two gigantic portions were just sitting in front of me waiting to be devoured. The eggs were perfectly poached, oozing with golden yolk as you dug your way in, beautifully dressed with sautéed Champignons de Paris, Pleurotes, Portobello mushrooms and lusciously coated with creamy hollandaise sauce. The eclectic atmosphere and excellent service from a dynamic team of smiling waiters, especially Jezabel, who was so patient with me most definitely adds stars to the experience. Kudos to owner Johnny Di Tomasso, a meticulous planner and team builder! Will I return to try the Chorizo at L'Avenue? I sure will and so should you. Just one note... this is not a 'cheapy eats' destination so it'll be a bit heavy on your wallet but you do get what you pay for.Now here's a happy accident! A popular place in the area was closed for brunch only for us to find out at the restaurant doorstep. Major bummer, right? We scrambled around for a decent place and were led to L'Avenue. A line was forming out the door so we too, had to fall in. Half an hour later of standing out in the cold, a table opens up for two. Booyah! We walked in to a warm and vibrant atmosphere of brunchers and their libations in hand. It was the weekend after all! My friend and I were more than happy to join in the fun. The place was packed, loud, and colorful! It felt like one big party was going on inside and I loved every bit of the vibe in the room. Our server was very French and so was the menu. No English menu available. Sure I could read some of the ingredients but who was I kidding?! I was starving and had no intention on doing a refresher of culinary French terms. Our very kind and quick server explained the menu to us so graciously and led us to order two kinds of eggs benedict that we will remember for quite some time...STEAK and EGGS. Wow! It was a beautiful plate full of promise. One bite and I was in heaven. Meat was tender and amazingly flavorful. The hollandaise sauce was fantastic. The egg, ohhh the egg! I cut into it and it was oozing with yellow silky yolk all over my plate. What a sight that was to behold. EGGS BENEDICT on FRENCH TOAST. Ahhhmazing! The perfect combination of sweet and savory in every spoonful. The toast was fluffy with a nice touch of "coconutty" sweetness while the ham, egg, and sauce had enough brine to let each ingredient shine. Yeah, that rhymed! Can't decide which one I like better but these two Bennies are without a doubt the best I've had, just yet.Servings are quite large but they're so good you'll end up finishing it anyway. My friend and I had one of each since an order comes with two pieces. Perfect sharing item, indeed. Both came with delicious rosemary seasoned potatoes and fresh fruits on the side. How complete can that brunch be? On that note, let's not forget how fantastic their mimosas were. Freshly squeezed OJ with some pulp and the right ratio of champagne to juice. Cheers! To wait out in the cold was a pain but I would have done it all over again on this same trip if only time was our friend in this city. I highly recommend!Oh. My. God. Yum. I went here on a Thursday for brunch with a friend and the reviews were right, this place is amazing. The waiter explained how they really put an emphasis on ensuring the best quality food, and this showed when we got our food. I arrived before my friend and was worried I would have to wait for her before I could get seated (there was only one couple in front of me when I arrived) but I asked the waiter and he said I didn't have to wait and seated me right by the window. He was very friendly and helpful. I had the French toast with bananas caramelized in captain Morgan rum, with Nutella and a sauce (which a believe had rum also) with real pieces of coconut on top. The flavors went so well together and weren't overly sweet tasting. The portion size was big, I wasn't able to finish my plate. I was surprised this place was even able to accommodate my friend who has so many restrictions (doesn't eat gluten, vegetarian, and lactose intolerant). She ordered the eggs Benedict with all vegetables, substituted the English muffins for portobello mushrooms ($2 charge) and swapped out her potatoes for a salad ($1 charge). I had read someone's review saying the bathrooms will give you nightmares, so of course I had to check them out, and they're awesome. There was a lot of water on the floor though :/ I will definitely be back here. I'd suggest going on a weekday before 11am to avoid a huge lineup.Best breakfast food ever.Omelets , panacakes, there were 4 of us and we couldnt even get up to leave.
Andrew Blair's=I felt like I need to provide a current Andrew Blair's review because a lot of these are outdated. Gone are the days of the packed house, dress code and club scene. They've attempted to rebrand with a new countrified logo and feel.  I am personally not a fan of the new AB logo with the wheat behind it but I appreciate their effort to have a more "comfortable" neighborhood feel. I saw several people in tshirts, shorts, jeans and sunglasses. Maybe it was the NRA in town but I even spotted some decidedly "red" folks.  So maybe it is like a country club, but in Gastonia. :)Their decor hasn't changed, so it still feels like a nice place, but definitely softer and more comfortable than say a Liberty gastropub. Opt for outdoor seating if the weather cooperates. Even on a hot night the fans keep the air moving and it was nice. They had a sangria special- it tastes fine enough but lacks the fun fruit you can munch on like at Sole, so I'd skip it for their nice wines.We had the meatloaf with mac and cheese and green beans. I really enjoyed the green beans- they were cooked perfectly and still retained a little snap to them. The meatloaf was also very nice.  We also had the filet mignon.  They had one misfire on temperature, but their make good efforts were overwhelming- best I've seen of any restaurant.  The remake of the steak was cooked perfectly, they replated it with new sides. The manager was very concerned about our happiness and took a lot of time talking with us.  She also invited us to their new brunch on Sundays. They apparently have a creme brulee french toast that looks divine. I wonder if it can compare with 131 Main's granola french toast?  But I digress. The portions were not large enough for my hungry man so we ordered a side of mushrooms which were nicely seasoned with shallots and scallions. We were offered two chocolate bourbon truffles at the end of the night which were lovely- not too sweet, and solid texture. We opted out of dessert (a shock to both of us, I know). I would like to go back for their Pinot Thursdays where they do Pinot Noir tastings on the 3rd Thursday of every month. Final tip: Citipass coupon book has a buy one get one free. So all in our meal cost $40 including a generous tip. So given that, the value was great.
Cafe La Bellitalia=We are really fortunate to have this little gem on Madison's lovely Northside. They remodeled the former Ole'N Rick's Northside Inn (or Rick'N Ole's, depending on which side of the sign you read) after the smoking ban was implemented in Madison in July 2005 (5 years before the statewide ban). Many critics thought bars and restaurants would not survive without their smoking patrons. Ole'N Rick's owners retired and sold their quaint space early during the smoking ban implementation. It turns out, a little Italian joint is exactly what the Northside needed, and Cafe La Bellitalia has been building their business here for the last 9 years.We ordered takeout, and here is the lowdown:They have great pizza, with LOADS of toppings. There's no skimpy pizza found here! We ordered an XL of The Works pizza. It was huge and tasted great! One thing we have noticed during our 13 years in Madison is that there isn't a lot of really good pizza in this town. Bellitalia is a list-topper for us. Pro tip: they sell slices over lunch on weekdays.I was in the mood for pasta and ordered the homemade fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. It comes with a "side" of garlic bread, which is essentially a small loaf of Italian bread. I immediately devoured this garlic butter goodness (I rode my bike 65 miles today, so I can eat whatever I want, right?). The pasta was delicious with it's perfectly creamy sauce and they didn't hold back at all on the chicken. The portion was HUGE in the take-out container, definitely enough for two people.We've had great experiences, both dining in and with take-out. There's always a good crowd and they seem to be doing a great business. They've certainly been a great addition to the Northside community.
Au Cinquième Péché=The food here is delicious, carefully crafted, beautifully presented, paired well with wines...it was a great dining experience overall.  The restaurant was recommended by our Canadian host.  The staff was extremely nice and helpful, and our waiter suggested a salmon appetizer and veal sweetbread entree.  The sweetbread was one of the best dishes I've ever eaten.  I can't say enough positives about the dining experience here.  Highly recommended.
Luke's Of Chicago=A co-worker of mine is often nostalgic for his Chicago days, and says that Luke's is the closest thing he has found to a Chicago-style hot dog in AZ.  So, on this gorgeous sunny day (how can you miss Chicago on a day like today!?) off we went to satisfy a craving for some Chi-Town goodness.If you can survive the parking lot rodeo that is the shopping area where Luke's is located, you are in for a treat.  Italian sandwiches, subs, burgers and of course, hot dogs.  This place is popular!  The space is small and the line to order can stretch out the door, so get there early if you want a table at lunchtime.I went with "The Original" - a pure beef hot dog with mustard, relish, pickle, and tomato in a poppy seed bun.  It is usually served with onions and peppers as well, but I like to make fresh breath a priority and decided against those.  I don't think there was any room left in the bun, anyway.  My friend had the Maxwell Street - a Polish sausage with onions, peppers and mustard.  It looked pretty tempting, too.  Both came with a side of crinkle-cut fries, which I upgraded to cheese fries in order to get a heart-stopping vat of cheese sauce for dipping.  I am not ashamed to admit that I ended up dipping the hot dog in there too.  So bad, but so good!I am now going to curl up under my desk and take a nap.I was brought here by two friends who live in Illinois, though not exactly in Chicago proper, who have been gushing about how good Luke's of Chicago's iIalian beef sandwiches for YEARS!  Now ever city has something it's known for: Boston has its baked beans, New York has its pizza, Hawaii has anything with pineapple or coconut on it, and Philadelphia has its cheesesteak sandwich.  Chicago has been lucky enough to have two specialty food items it's well known for - pizza and italian beef sandwiches - which must be why they were generous enough to share one of them with the Scottsdale/Phoenix area. According to my friends,  Luke's of Chicago was a family owned chain back in Chicago and one of the family members moved out to the Phoenix and that's why this one exists.  Now, I'm writing this review from (Davis) Illinois, but that certainly doesn't make me an authority on what makes for the best Italian beef sandwiches having very little basis for comparison.  What I DO know is that the sandwich I was served last Monday at this particular location of Luke's of Chicago - an Italian beef sandwich, baptized (dunked or doused in warm meet juices) and layered with sweet peppers and cheese was PRETTY FREAKIN' AMAZING.  I'm serious, this was a freakishly good sandwich, worth doing a little extra driving for.  My friends assure me that this is the best Italian sandwich I'll ever taste, and I may do a little comparison shopping while I'm in Illinois to figure out if that is indeed true or not.We also ordered some regular french fries and garlic parmesan fries to share and I admit I am also a fan. It was 114 F in Phoenix the day we came here, not a day you'd normally be looking to eat something hot, but that didn't dissuade us since we were on a mission.  I come out to Phoenix once a year from California but this was my first experience at Luke's, my friends went without me last year - still not sure I've forgiven them for that.
Zaba's Mexican Grill=Zaba's Mexican Grill is a small chain of  convenient Americanized Mexican fast food eateries, all located in the Las Vegas area. There are about 5 -6 of them now.Zaba's is like Chipotle, but browner. No, not browner as in darker Mexicans, ones with more indian blood than Spanish blood. Not at all. Browner because instead of white floured tortillas or white rice, they offer healthier brown. Zaba's concept is very similar to Chipotle, even the line and service process at the counter is similar. But Zaba's offers more variety. Such as brown rice, wheat tortillas, or fish and shrimp tacos or burritos. They also have a more colorful decor than the tin can aluminum decor of Chipotle. This one is also larger than most Chipotles, with booths and tables and about 2 to3 times the seating capacity.I came here to order lunch for a group I was visiting in a nearby office, a lunch and learn session. They had faxed the order in, but the manager was so anal, he couldn't fill the order unless they used their official fax order form! WTF? He faxed back the official form and said he called. Meanwhile, I had talked to him several times about the order, and he didn't tell me this. So I had to call the office, confirm the order, and told him to fill in the blanks that weren't on the order. He had difficulty with this, being a bit OCD or something.We finally got the order put together and delivered the food. It is pretty tasty, even when it is browner.
Samba Brazilian Grill=I know this may be surprising to some, but I think Samba is the best Brazilian Steakhouse I have ever been to. To this date I have now been to some in Chicago, in Kansas, and in Madison and Madison wins hands down! I love that when they built this place they put a more casual restaurant downstairs and you have to go upstairs to enter the Brazilian Steakhouse. The outside is always decorated in lights and really creates the right mood before you even enter the building. I have been there 4 different times since it has opened and every time it is amazing. It is cheaper than the ones found in Chicago as well as in Kansas and personally has much better food. As soon as you walk in you are greeted by very friendly hostess who always offer to hang up your coats. Each time I have had a reservation I have always been promptly seated. The waiters are pretty quick to come up and offer drinks and explain how the concept of a Brazilian Steakhouse works. Their drink menu is rather large and each time I try a new one it is fantastic! I love going up to their salad bar area where they have an array of items including obviously salad items, vegetables, mashed potatoes (yum!), bread and so much more. Once you have eaten your "appetizers" you flip over your coaster to the green side so the men in gauchos know to come around and offer you different cuts of meat. So many of them are good, I always start by trying almost all of them and then once I have decided my favorites of the night I normally have seconds of those specific kinds. I also love that most of the nights I have gone (I think 3 out of the 4) they had live bands playing. It fit right into the atmosphere and creates such a nice night every time. The music is never to loud or obnoxious, it is rather enjoyable to get a table near the stage and listen to some great music as you enjoy a fantastic meal. You really can not go wrong at such a great place. The main things to remember about this great place: 1. They have a large selection of original drinks and a large wine menu 2. The meat is delicious 3. Relatively inexpensive for a Brazilian Steakhouse Enjoy!I have never been to a Brazilian steak house before. This was quite an experience. For those of you who don't know what goes down at these places, let me enlighten you. Basically, people with two foot meat-on-a-stick come to your table and cut the meat right off the slab for you. To me, it seemed a little barbaric and kinda gross. I couldn't get myself to eat much of the different meats they had. However, they had this awesome roasted (?) pineapple on a stick that was so flavorful, it knocked my socks off. I mean, it was REALLY good. They also had a impressive salad bar. The salad bar has every salad ingredient you've never heard of. So, for me anyway, since I didn't know what 80% of the ingredients were, I ended up with a pretty pathetic salad. They also had warm sides which included some pretty bitchin mashed potatoes.  Meh, I don't think I'll ever come here again. I'm glad I tried it though.
Geisha House Steak & Sushi=Every so often I yearn for Japanese steakhouse fare.  On one such recent night Diane and I traveled to Geisha House to take care of that craving.  And, we were not disappointed.  The Miso Soup with sliced White Mushrooms and green onion circles floating in a consomme-like broth was hot and heartening.  A circular presentation of a Rainbow Roll was fairly good as a starter, and was refreshingly cold sushi to act as a counterpoint to the hot soup that preceded it.  This was followed by a nice salad with Iceberg Lettuce, a slice of tomato, carrot slivers, and cucumbers with a tasty Ginger Dressing.A trademark of Geisha House is its pink-colored, spiced up Fried Rice, with carrots, onion, and egg.  Valentine's Day was just around the corner, but I still considered the pink-buttered rice to be gimmicky and would have been glad to do without it.  However, I appreciate that, besides including both soup and salad, this restaurant serves Fried Rice as part of its meals to all guests, without tacking on an extra charge.  I have found this to be uncommon for Teppenyaki establishments.Next served were generous spatula heapings of grilled zucchini, sprouts, mushrooms and white onions, along with a few grilled shrimps.  To supplement these edibles, along with our orders of Filet Mignon Diane and I split a side of shrimp, which gleaned about 8 more big shrimps apiece for $16.50.  Prices are somewhat steep here, but you get high quality ingredients, and an abundance of food.  At $26.95 a steak, our cut up morsels of Filet were cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered off a nice slab of meat that looked to be about 7 ounces in size.  Accompanying sauces included a very strong, mustard-based Meat Sauce, and a nice mild Shrimp Sauce.  The atmosphere here is boisterous, with rockin' music blaring overhead, and a party atmosphere.  Fellow diners were congenial and in a good mood, and a young crowd congregated at the large bar.  The place always seems to be busy, with many celebrating special occasions.  Birthday balloons commonly abound.  So, rather than being potentially disappointed, I recommend making a reservation in advance like I generally do.  Busy as the restaurant was while we were there on this last occasion, service was excellent and efficient.  Refills of hot tea, Sprite, and water were supplied without having to make requests.  Our grillmaster was proficient at his craft, and displayed some nice tricks accompanied by good humor.  I don't know whether he deserves credit for this or not, but when he set fire to a volcanic onion, the flame jumped up and formed the shape of a dragon's head, which by pure luck I was able to  capture on my digital camera's memory card (see pic).  It is the Chinese Year of the Dragon, after all!  Wait, this is a Japanese restaurant!  Nevertheless, it was a cool moment in the midst of a very pleasurable meal.When I received my check, the Rainbow Roll had been inadvertently left off.  I told my server, and it was added to the bill, with thanks for pointing out the omission.A solid 4 stars!Let me just say that if it weren't for an impromptu invitation to come here and join a b-day party, I would've never set foot here again. I ate here at the sushi bar about 3 or 4 years ago and was not impressed at all. I decided at that time that I would just go elsewhere for sushi when I needed my fix.Tonight, I decided to open up to this place again and try habachi since I was invited to join a party of 9 other folks celebrating a birthday. I was pretty happy to see that the Geisha Special offered everything I needed in one order: shrimp tempura, soup, salad, fried rice, veggies, chicken, filet mignon, lobster and a choice of drink--all for $35. The chef was entertaining and had a great rapport with us rowdy patrons. The atmosphere of the whole place is just so fun and relaxed. It made a huge impact on the dining experience. The table next to us was not as rowdy since half of them were kids. I can see that the chefs here definitely play off of the crowd they're working with. (We were all adults and there was some maturely suggested things going on during the live cooking demonstration, tehe.)Not only was it very entertaining to watch being cooked, the food tasted excellent as well. They have this pink "secret sauce" that they put on everything and tastes phenomenal. I don't think I've had shrimp or lobster more tasty than what they serve here. I tried to con the chef into telling him I needed to know what was in the secret sauce because I may be allergic to an ingredient, but he didn't fall for it since my poker face was much harder to keep after having a few saki bombs.Overall, great service and an awesome dining experience that I won't soon forget. And to think I had been missing out this whole time before giving this place a second try. I can't wait to gather a group of folks to have dinner here again soon.
Cajun Seafood Corner=I should have walked out right after I walked in.  My gut was telling me to leave, but I didn't.... I stuck it out.  Big mistake.We were the only ones in there at 1pm on a Saturday.. bad sign #1.  I ordered the 1lb of boiled shrimp, "Original" style with rice.  I didn't realize "Original" meant "no flavor and way overcooked".  They were so overcooked they were hard to peel and were served with a chipotle mayonnaise!!  Gross!  The rice was literally Asian rice, with a sprinkle of  "cajun seasoning" on top that tasted exactly like a bowl  of white Asian rice.My partner had a Jambalaya thing, thickened with corn-starch and had overcooked shrimps as well.  I would highly recommend avoiding this place.When you pull up outside of the Cajun Seafood Corner, you feel like you are about to enter the Cajun Playtime Corner - the storefront certainly does nothing to reveal the beguiling bayou dishes inside.The decor is reminiscent of any number of Cajun eateries found in New Orleans: Mardi Gras beads and masks hung lovingly on anything stationary, remnants of an old pier, plastic seagulls, fishing nets, and many colorful beer and liquor ads.But you didn't come here for the ambiance, you came her for Cajun!Begin your sensory journey into the swamps with any one of the Bayou Teasers such as the Cajun alligator or Cajun frog legs.  (one tastes like fish, one tastes like chicken)  The appetizers start at $4.95 for Fried Okra and go up to $11.95 for a dozen oysters.Chomp into some Poboys such as the sauteed alligator served wth tomatoe, lettuce, pickle, onion, and their house Cajun sauce.  These come with a delicous basket of Cajun Fries wwhich are hot, fluffy, crispy, and dusted with Cajun spices - amazing with their house aioli.House specialties include Cajun shrimp, Crawfish boil when in season, étouffée, Cajun pasta, seafood jambalaya, gumbo, and blackened catfish. Prices start at $8.95 and go up to $45.95 for the five pounds of crawfish boiled, cooked with andouille, corn, and potatoes.The Seafood gumbo is worth the visit, and was truly transcendent. Hearty, cajuned, and packed with plump shrimp, mussels, scallops, chicken, andouille, okra, and rice - it brought me back to the bayou.The crawfish etouffee was also notable, with a rich creamy cajun sauce packed with plump and juicy crawfish - not to mention the portion was very generous for the $8.85 price.Live crawfish are used here when in season, and the time is now!Daily happy hour is from 2-7p, Happy hour appetizers start at $3.95, Domestic beers at $1.75, and drinks at $3.00.I've been craving a shrimp PoBoy since I left Louisiana, the land of tasty PoBoy's. I drove by this place and flipped a bitch so that I could check it out for lunch. It looks a little uninviting from the outside. I was very surprised to find a quaint little bar and seating area. I thought it was going to be more of a take out place and I almost turned around and walked out because I had my puppy in the car and didn't plan on leaving him. But the woman behind the bar was very inviting and told me she could have my poboy out in five minutes. I told her I'd be in the car with my dog but I'd come back in a couple minutes to get my order. Sure enough, five minute later she comes walking out with my order. I thought it was really great customer service to bring it out to my car for me. The poboy was satisfactory. The breading on the shrimp was too thick and the shrimp was lost in there, everything else about the sandwich was great, especially the roll. The fries were fat, long and perfectly seasoned, all fries should be made like this. I will be back for some Étouffée and this time leave the dog at home so I can enjoy a cold one at the bar.
Alto Ristorante e Bar=Located inside the Hyatt Gainey Ranch hotel, The Better Half and I stumbled across this place one night.  It was a pleasant surprise.  There were so many things on the menu that caught our eye.  We decided to go with:Three different types of Bruschetta:- Arrabiata (Spicy Tomatoes, Olives & Garlic), $4- Peperonata (Roasted Peppers, Capers & Basil), $4http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=TmZ6hTHPUtcTFDIs3QR3oQ#TmZ6hTHPUtcTFDIs3QR3oQ- Fagioli (Cannellini Beans, Crispy Prosciutto), $4http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=bYJOjgNiWW6yeWXsy_IXaQ#bYJOjgNiWW6yeWXsy_IXaQEntrees:Fettuccine alla Bolognese (Fettuccine w/Veal and Pork Shank Ragout), $22http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=wvuSD4YdYIc5r_eENfRE8Q#wvuSD4YdYIc5r_eENfRE8QAnatra in Agro-Dolce (Duck Breast, Roasted Baby Vegetableswith Sweet & Sour Roasted Duck Leg, Pine Nuts Sultanas and a Honey Herb Sauce), $27http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=vYEXJIcrxfCh4-cgl5AJlg#vYEXJIcrxfCh4-cgl5AJlgSide DishRisotto w/Parmesan Cheese & Parsley, $7http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=LHXaImmzdoKPh0qcB9Td5Q#LHXaImmzdoKPh0qcB9Td5QDessertCreme Bruleehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale?select=pDHJTf0_B-ToAMq8VCuXFA#pDHJTf0_B-ToAMq8VCuXFAIt sounds like a lot of food, but it wasn't too bad.  The portions are not over the top huge.  Out of the 3 Bruschettas we tried, my favorite was the Fagioli.  It was totally different than anything I've tried before.  The Beans went very well with the Prosciutto and Bread.The Fettuccine all Bolognese was awesome....very rich though.  The Veal & Pork Shank Ragout was what made it rich and full of flavor.  I had a bite of The Better Half's Anatra and it was good too.  The side of Risotto went perfectly with our meal.I was only able to get a small bite out of TBH's Creme Brulee....she doesn't like to share her Dessert, ha!  It was delish....next time, we'll order less Bruschetta so I can get one for myself.Service was outstanding during the entire meal.Return Factor - 85%
Arrowhead Grill=Had dinner here my first night in town with my mom, step father and my grandmother. Upon walking in,I knew we were venturing into an upscale type of steak house-not quite the dark boothed feel of old school and not quite a Ruth Chris atmosphere. We were seated in a booth, our waitress was very nice and very young. She advised us of two specials-one a veal chop and one a fish of sorts. My grandmother has been known to love veal chops and we all strongly encouraged her to order one. The rest of the menu was inviting and this is also the type of restaurant where all the sides are a la carte. I ordered the rib eye medium rare and grandma and I decided to share a caesar salad and a baked potato. Mom ordered a salad, step dad ordered prime rib and a potato as well. Our salad arrived as well as bread. The first thing I was shocked with is that instead of spitting the salad for us in the kitchen, the brought the salad and an another plate. First of all, in this type of establishment, for these types of prices, and considering the economy,  I was a bit put off but was able to let it go. Our meals arrived on very hot plates. The veal chop was gorgeous-and grandma dove right in. My rib eye was also gorgeous and huge (should have been for $27+), but it was finished off with butter (something I don't like especially without a gallbladder) and had a spicy rub on it. I took two small bites and was overwhelmed by the spicy flavor (something again I hate with a supposed good cut of meat um, hello Outback). The prime rib was good (or so I was told) and when the waitress came back(this took a long time as well), I told her that the menu did not state the meat was seasoned nor finished off with butter. She acknowledged I was correct and asked if I would like another steak. At this point, I was done (I get like this when I get mad at food) and said no. She was apologetic and grandma kept on loving the veal chop. I was eating the potato grandma and I were splitting and the owner/chef came to our table and apologized for the steak. I said it was fine, he said he would take it off the bill (DUH) and then I said to him it was probably a good idea to train the waitstaff to advise how the steaks are prepared with spice rub and finished off with butter. He then told me they ARE trained to do this and that our waitress did advise him that she forgot to mention this to us/me. Oh well.I like the fact this place is not a chain restaurant. I like that my grandmother enjoyed her meal so much. I didn't like the lack of service for the price nor my meal, so I will have to say this place will not be on my "must visit" list the next time or any time I am in town.Good Steak, Bad Business!My husband, our son (aged 7) and I went to Arrowhead Grill to celebrate my hubby's 42nd birthday. Upon arrival, we were immediately seated, waitstaff was nice, everything went well till the steaks came out.We had already had some decent raw oysters, and some ok-not-great- bread. My $43 DelMonico ("our specialty of the house"!) was so tough I had to send it back. The waiter was appropriately apologetic and brought it back; made me a hew one, but it wasn't done till my family was almost done with the rest of dinner, and I was about full of the a la carte side dishes anyway by that time.(of them, the creamed spinach was VERY good, and the cheesy scallopped potatoes too cheesy and not creamy at all. More like smothered potatoes.)The manager came over and partially apologized, made sure the new one was good, and told me "The second steak is on us." Like I even got to EAT the first one, OR the second one, since it came out 15 mins after I sent the other back!! For a family of three who had spent $236, they charged me for BOTH Delmonico steaks and then took ONE off. BAD BUSINESS! The ENTIRE steak should have been removed from the bill, consistent with policy at other eateries of this caliber. It was not very flavorful but was more tender, but I only ate about 4 bites before I was too full to eat anymore. Plus, now I was annoyed. In this economy, people are more choosy about where to spend their hard-earned money. Why drive people away with an asinine practice like that??When I complained about the policy, the manager kind of shrugged and said, more or less, it is what it is. He actually smirked. It was very car-salesman-like. (Sorry, car salesmen.)We will be taking our next $200 meal-eating selves to Ruth's Chris from now on. VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.On an up note, my husband said HIS filet mignon was one of the best he ever had, AND I have to admit the $7 tableside s'mores are well worth the time and the mere $7 if you have a kid who likes to roast marshmallows and get sticky. The marshmallows were homemade bug square ones cut into four pieces, you get to melt those over a little flame and dip into melted Hershey's chocolate and eat on a graham cracker. That was the best part of the meal for some of us!!But seriously folks, there's a reason Arrowhead can't play with the big guys...they don't treat their customers like the big guys do. Even though we live nearby, we will make the drive to a better place, where we are bound to get the steak done right the first time; AND get treated right when things go wrong so there will BE a next time.When Arrowhead Grill came up as next on my list of places to review, the first thought that crossed my mind was "I need to give this place another shot". So, here is my first impression of Arrowhead Grill: Great place if they STEP UP the service. I visited AG with a friend during restaurant week. The restaurant had just opened up and servers were still setting up here and there. We were seated immediately and we waited to be greeted...and waited. Finally, our waiter made his way over to our table. Here's my thing, when you open your doors for business, you should be ready for business, ready for customers. You could tell he was unprepared to help us out. What about the food? Fantastic. I thought the food was great! I started with Hog Island Kumamoto Oysters. They were small, fresh, and sweet oysters. No funky smell or taste, totally fresh and delightful. For my entree I had the 10 oz Delmonico Steak, rare of course! What a great slab of beef! I sent my compliments to the chef. The steak was cooked beautifully and seasoned perfectly. On the side, I had the Yukon gold mashed potatoes which were delicious! I was full of meat and potato goodness but we had dessert coming! I chose the creme brulee which was perfect consistency and finished table side which was a nice touch! So in between courses, our waiter would vanish. The restaurant wasn't packed at all,so I can only guess he was still doing set up work, but that left my drink empty on too many occasions and me needing a set of silverware. I was annoyed, unfortunately.I will certainly give Arrowhead Grill another shot. The food was very good. Hopefully the quality of service will match the food on my next visit!Sorry this place really sucked . it was expensive and not worth the money YOU CAN COOK BETTER even if you can't cook..I have no idea why people like and recommend this place . anything cheese is from what I had is in a fake cheese sauce . Very orange even more so than Velveeta . The side vegetable (was asparagus ) was cooked till it fell apart and with less skill than the local 2 Star Asian Buffet. disappointed more so than most placesAs only a VERY SLIGHT update 1/22/14Since my review I haven't been back so I can't update my review but my husband ate here twice. He said the steaks he had were OK. He didn't have vegetables either visit but did have the Green Chile Macaroni and Cheese and said it was very improved from what we had when we were there. I asked him how he'd rate his meals and he said around three stars because it was OK. Most likely I won't return anyway.Came here for Mother's day per friends recommendation. My mom and i both ordered the Delmonico steak. My steak came out fine but my mom's steak was TOO salty. We sent it back and the 2nd steak came out with no flavor. Service was very poor and the restaurant wasn't even busy. We had to ask the waitress to refill our bread and she forgot twice. Manager knew the problem and didn't even stop to talk to us. Worst part is the manager walked away to avoid us as we tried to approach him. For the price we paid for the food we expected better service. Will not go back.Buyer beware.  Took advantage of the New Years special this evening, (buy one Delmonico steak between 9-10pm and get the second one for free).  Upon explaining to our waiter that we wanted to take advantage of their "advertised special" in the AZ Central dining deals from AZ Republic that had been advertised since December 21st on this website,we were informed he was not aware of such special.  Upon which my date and I felt totally embarrassed as I didn't want to look like I was just trying to get something for nothing.  He checked with his manager and said "they would honor it", a $28.99 value, but that it was the AZ central error.  From that point on our waiter was very short with us and made us feel like we're putting him out because he wasn't going to make as much in tips from us.  This couldn't be further from the truth, as all items were alacarte and with wine it actually came out to more than if we had ordered steaks alone.  The steaks by the way were excellent, but the tone for the evening with the poor service didn't make up for the taste and presentation of the food.  By the way, we overheard the couple in the booth behind us request the same special, but by that time the restaurant was aware that people would be comming in for the special.Finally to make matters worse, when we got bill for the two of us it had an automatic gratuity of 20% added to the bill.  When I explained to the waiter that this must be a mistake he explained that it was "their policy" to add on this automatic charge whenever they have to "give away food".  When I explained that I didn't feel comfortable in paying such a high mandatory amount, he immediately said he would get the manager and stormed off in a huff.Manager Eric S. came over and supported his waiter by basically backing him up and not listening to our valid complaints.  He actually stormed off also when we told him we wanted to have him adjust the gratuity to what was a more fair assessment of service at 10-15%.  He came back and gave a half hearted apology for "feeling threatened" when I told him I would let others know of their lousy customer service. So there you have it, It appears that their is an attitude at the Arrowhead grill is greater than though, and how dare we to complain.  Needless to say we will not ever be back though the food was good,not worth the hassle and a terrible New Years Eve meal ruined by their ineffective ability to act professional and with grace and understanding.well.......I was taken here last night for my birthday dinner at the suggestion of a friend.  We were going to dine at The Keg because my request was Filet Mignon and King Crab Legs.  This place.....oy!  we had a 7:15 reservation.  had to wait for a few minutes to be seated....not a big deal.  we were sat and began to look at the menu.  PRICEY!  which is fine for us usually.  Asked our waitress Brittany if they had Filet and crablegs.....I was told that i had to order TWO plates.....one for steak and then another whole plate of crab legs.......huh?  12oz filet was $34 and 16oz crab legs plate was $46.........AND.......ALL of the entrees come with NO sides at all.....you have to order your sides seperately....another $8-$14 just for a side. WHAT?  no salad before....no nothing.  they brought bread out to the table....but they were breadsticks and they don't even give you enough for everyone at your table to have a whole one to themselves. put in our order......food arrived........40 minutes later?  are you kidding me?  yes,,,,,there was a well done steak in the mix......but that should have taken 20 minutes.  at the most!  our foodserver Brittany was EXTREMELY scarce!  extremelely!!!  the steak....when it finally came out.....was very good and fresh.....i will say that.......but the fries we ordered for my son.....came out cold.  sent them back......still room temperature.  and they tasted like they were fried in old grease. eh.  It was birthday and i didn't want to make the table of my guests feel uncomfortable by complaining.  so i zipped it. THEN.  I was told they would be bringing out a special dessert with a candle for my birthday.  okay.....cool.  brought out this big plate with a delicious dessert on it and a roman candle to blow out.  i think it was the butter cake....which was absolutely delicious.  FINALLY......after flagging down the "too busy to give us the great service we thought we were paying for" Brittany.......we got the bill.  We had 6 ppl in our party.  two of the people split a steak.....my husband, son, and i split two filets....one 8 oz and one 12oz and a 16oz king crab leg......we had the french fry trio to split....lyonnaise potatoes.....and the lampchop fondue. our bill came to over $250.  How?  they charged us twice for the french fries that we sent back.......the sharing of the over priced meals....AND.......THE BIRTHDAY DESSERT????  they charged me for the birhtday dessert that THEY chose for me?  had i known that I would have liked to try something else on their dessert menu.  THEY CHARGED ME FOR A DESSERT I DIDN"T EVEN GET TO PICK OUT.  I am in total disbelief of this place.  Don't go there.  we are by no means "cheap" people.  but like anyone else....don't like to go somewhere that we feel we were robbed and cheated out of a great dining experience. DO NOT EAT HERE.  you are better off paying the same amount of money.......getting great service..........and not feeling like you're robbed and any other reputable steak house. This place needs to do some serious thinking about their pricing and teach their foodservers that if you are going to work at a place that is that pricey....the service better be tip top!I don't recall EVER dining with someone who has said, before ordering, "I wouldn't come back here".  Why?  Because we choose our dining out experiences carefully.  But one of my dinner companions declared it at Arrowhead last Monday evening, shortly after we ordered our pre-dinner cocktails.We chose Arrowhead because of the positive Yelp reviews - on which we have relied during our travels throughout the Southwest, West, Southeast, and our own Milwaukee/Chicago area.  I often scan the poor reviews, but disregard if there are an ample number of 4 or 5 stars and elaboration.  I was wrong this time.Ambiance: The entrance to this upscale steak/seafood restaurant is stunning, but once in the dining room - - - not so much.  The decor was uninteresting, stale, and not intimate.  A table candle (lighting was dim) or a fresh bloom on the table would have gone a long way.  (See posted photo.)  After all, this place advertises itself as "a new class of neighborhood grill".Service:  We waited a long time to order as our waiter seemed to have vanished (finished our wine and had our water glasses filled twice).   Had to ask the busboy to fetch him.  Yes, our steaks and Arctic char were good - but were served without garnish or flair.  A little parsley, lettuce, dill, kale leaf, or WHATEVER would have dressed the big white bare entree plates more like the entrees shown on the Arrowhead website.  Had to wait a bit longer for our side orders so we had time to stare at the starkness of the plates .  When the dishes arrived (Yukon gold mashed potatoes and creamed spinach) they were OK,  but not delicious and seemed as though they had been nuked from a frozen state.  This kind of "side" might be OK at home or at a chain eatery, but not at an "upscale" restaurant when one is paying extra for everything except for the piece of meat entree order.Again, the Delmonico steak, New York strip, and Arctic char were delicious, but we chose Arrowhead for a dining EXPERIENCE comparable to other 4/5 star reviewed restaurants that we've visited and enjoyed. This is a pricey restaurant that does not live up to it's potential.I had high hopes... The AG entry was beautifully decorated, but as you walk in to the dining room it became very simple. It is dark with a romantic feel. It's not very big either. Bottom line for what we paid, I want to feel like a fat, happy princess. Shrimp cocktail app was presented beautifully (over dry ice). The 3 shrimp were huge and very good, but if you have 4 people you can add another one? $16.99 plus $5.50 that's expensive in my book. The steaks were good and I recommend that if you are a Med rare person order it rare plus as it is served on a 400 degree plate and keeps cooking. The steaks had a nice flavor. The sides are all ala carte. The AG potatoes were very good, green beans also nice. My daughter who ordered off the kids menu wanted a little side of steamed broccoli, most places are accommodating to this, but we were charged the full $8.99. That was about the same as her meal. The specialty drink list was cool. The wine list in a Steak House should "wow" you... No I was not impressed. Service was so mediocre! Not at all what my bill demanded. Many reviews compare AG to Flemings, and I eat there all the time along with many other upscale steakhouses. Folks this is not in the same league. You ask why not 2 stars well the food did taste good and I'm on vacation so I'm more laid back.
Geisha A Go Go=The best thing about this place are the bathrooms! No Shit! Er, I mean no kidding!The decor in the bathroom is expensive, mimicking a Japanese ancient Castle, with large cuts on stone masonry, copper pots for sinks, and metal tubes to look like large bamboo as the faucets. The next best thing is the large stone in the middle of the room. It is a large rock with a spotlight on it, and mimicks a Japanese rock garden.The third best thing is the out door patio seating, with the misters going full blast as the tempurature still hovers around 100 at 11:00pm in August. There are several tables out there, and also some couches.The 4th best thing is the Pachinko machines in the entryway, brightly lit and real, However, as the cute hostess will tell you, she has no balls (for the pachinko machines, stupid!)The 5th best thing is their large drink menu of specialty drinks. I didn't look in there for an "Orgasm" or a "SloeComfortableScrew Against the Wall", or other ridiculous concoctions, etc. I felt like a Tanqueray and Tonic.  No, Make it two!The rest of what they have to offer is, well, meh!A coworker tried to make out with my boyfriend at happy hour here and I still freaking love it! I mean, what a great time, right? Sake bombers, sushi, random drunk broads coming on to your boyfriend because you spent too much time playing with the toilet controls in the bathroom?  Seriously girls, be careful in there.Thankfully, my boyfriend did not give in to Drunky McSluttersons advances. However, the fact that she even had the gall to attempt it is really a testament to how awesome Geisha A Go Go's happy hour is. Chick was wasted. Hard not to get drunk when everything on the damn drink menu is half off! I think we were drinking $3 beers and $1 Sakes. $1! Truly wonderful.The "House Maki" is half off also, which usually means basic rolls like California and Tuna, but nothing fancy. Geisha A Go Go's "House Maki" includes quite a few of the fancier roll selections, including one of my faves, the rainbow roll.  The sushi is really nothing to write home about, but when you got a nice buzz going on with aforementioned $1 Sakes, you don't really notice.To recap: Happy Hour is awesome, Sushi is Okay, Bathrooms are time consuming, Don't take slutty coworkers.I have never really been a fan of public masturbation, but then again, I had never been to Geisha A Go Go's restrooms before either. Ladies, they have an osculating bidet that has front and back controls.......There was a large (and excessively rowdy) group of us in one of the private Karaoke rooms celebrating Nathan S's 35th birthday this  past Saturday and I gotta say, I had a damn blast. We sang Love Shack and Sweet Caroline and Careless Wisperer. I even did an inappropriate duet to "Like A Virgin."Oh, and those pear vodka champagne drink things?? I unknowingly sucked down 6 of them. Thanks to Georgie S for making sure it was Grey Goose. Anyway, sure I paid $54, but I was seriously having the best drunken blast and I felt like I hadn't touched a drop the next morning.So, the waitress fucking hated us, but we had a g-damned blast. A BLAST. We twirled on poles, sang horrifically at the top of our lungs and probably contracted some diseases from the booths and carpets, but whatevs, it was a blast!And P.S... I never actually used the bidet.... really... for more than a secondSo things may have gotten off to a rocky start (losing our reservation for 13 and having to eat outside), but thanks to friendly service and yummy rolls, I found myself in a very forgiving mood. Is this place super authentic for you sushi snobs? Definitely no. But it's a fun atmosphere and there are plenty of options for vegetarians, and even non-sushi eaters (everyone loved the chicken teriyaki sliders). The most memorable item of the night for me was a roll featuring crushed fritos. Sounds gross, I know, but with the katsu sauce on it it tasted more like panko breading than corn chips. Most importantly, the cocktails are amazing - I could not get enough of my kiwi cocktail (I think it was called the kinky cooler - ignore the name and just try it!)After dinner, we piled into one of the private karaoke rooms and thanks to our helpful waitress and many sake bombs, we had a wonderful night. They were lacking some randomly important karaoke songs, but we managed to have a good time regardless. I have to say I thought we'd get more use out of the pole in the middle of the room though!Two very important notes, one good, one not so good:First, you MUST go to the bathroom. Anyone who's ever been curious about those fancy Japanese toilets will have a blast in the ladies' room (can't speak for the boys' room). I'm surprised they put them in because I bet on busy nights a long line must form as people are testing out all the fun, weird functions on the toilet. Second, a note to whoever writes the descriptions for the rolls on the menu: You may not have too many Asians in your life, but next time you're thinking of a way to describe your sushi, saying things like 'you no likey?' and 'herro!' are not appropriate and may be offensive to some!Sign me up for a return visit based on the eye candy alone. Every server here was a total smoke show! The amount of times I fell in love was the equivalent to the number of sake bombs I consumed (4) making my evening both easy on the eyes and buzzworthy. Even though I showed up late to meet my coworkers and the food was not exactly fresh, it was certainly apparent that for Scottsdale sushi this is a hot spot. Several of the rolls I tried were unique with innovative flavor combinations. For dessert we headed into the private karaoke rooms where I ordered a large humiliation sundae. My only caution is to be prepared for the most random song selection you've ever seen. With very minimal hip hop or 80's tunes and a heavy dose of Celine Dion, just be prepared to double my intake of bombs in order to be comfortable singing here.Wake me up, before you Geisha A Go Go...This place conjures up images of super cool Geisha chicks wearing modified robes (ie super short) with white boots dancing to "These Boots Are Made For Walking." I just love the fun vibe here, which is carried through to both the cocktail and sushi menus. It's not just about vibe, though. The food is Wham Bam Good!The veggie gyoza is possibly amongst the best I've ever had and I've had a lot in my time. I'm talking about whole edamame in the dumplings! Wrappers are slightly crisp, perfectly pan fried. I also recommend the tasty veg soba noodles. A very simple dish, but one that I all but inhaled, because it's perfectly prepared.The veggie sushi roll was slightly disappointing. As it's the only vegetarian sushi option that I found on the menu, I ordered it hoping for more than the usual carrot, cuc and...? (no avocado to be found and I think it should always be featured in a veggie roll to keep it from being too dry). The whole shebang is just really tasteless. The avo/cuc roll I ordered never arrived, but I know our large table ordered up so much that it's not really a big deal. If I had really wanted it, I would have asked for it. I do think that because Geisha is a post modern take on a sushi joint that they could stand to get creative with the vegetarian sushi rolls.Now, let's turn to the fun karaoke rooms! Never did the private room thang before and although the machines kind of confused us (as did the song choices, quite honestly), the super sweet and lovely waitresses/hostesses never left us hanging and tried to be of assistance whenever they could.Next time I'm back, I'll be singing my rendition of Wake Me Up Before You Go Go (what? I love that song!) in homage to all the geishas out there...wave your hands like you just don't care...oh, the possibilities are endless when you have a cocktail in one hand and mic in the other.Go Go here for happy hour! From 4-7pm you can delight in their half priced apps and specialty cocktails. Their sushi rolls are meh, but their teriyaki ribs are falling off the bone, finger lickin' good! The cocktails seem to be concocted for little Asian girls (which is odd since there are no Asian girls in Scottsdale, especially now that my BFF and I are gone) - fruity with cutesy names like "Hello Kitty," "Harajuku Lover," "Shiso Horny," and "Kinki Kooler" just to name a few. My favorite was the "Turning Japanese" which was like biting into a vodka infused pear.Service at the bar was wonderful - Victoria is the one of the cutest bartenders in Old Town (guys, go pay her a visit). Drinks were flowing and the food came out quickly.In addition to the happy hour and Victoria, make sure you check out their restrooms and private karaoke rooms, complete with "entertainment" poles. If you end up spending a long time on their Toto toilets, people will understand why. Seat warmer and a bidet? You'll want to take your business there on a daily basis.i went here for a friends birthday party. everything was just mediocre. the waitress was super nice and great at recommending drinks. i had the kiwi one...totally recommend it. i am not sure what their system is but it's a mess. they kept bringing random sushi rolls that no one ordered and then they would get pissed like we playing a trick on them or something. then they wouldn't bring some rolls out at all so people were waiting forever. then people had rolls on their tabs that they didn't even order. it was a mess.I've been here a few times already and just now realized I haven't left a review!Sunday is the best day to come here. Half off sushi and drinks... fabulous all day happy hour. If you're not into sushi (and therefore, you're crazy) just get the rock shrimp bowl... amazing. They also have different flavors of sake (pomegranate is a fav) and sake bombers as well (Sapporo is in large bottles; Kierin is in small bottles). There's a DJ, and karaoke, and lots of beautiful people. Go here.Let me start by saying when you come here get the Hello Kitty martini! Don't ask questions just get it! lol. I've been here a few times and I really do enjoy coming here. I ALWAYS get the hello kitty martini. The name just speaks for itself. It comes with Pinnacle citrus, Japanese strawberry soda, and fruit infused Sake. Yummy!!! For food, I always get the Gaijin roll. It's like a chimicanga type sushi roll. I know, it sounds weird but it's actually quite tasty. I don't usually do hand rolls, and I've never gotten a philly hand roll before but omg, I loved it! The only negative thing about this place is it can be a bit pricey during regular hours. However, they do have happy hour everyday from 3-7 and half off ALL drinks on Sundays. The service is also really good. We were always checked on and they're also very knowledgeable about everything. I need to come back during happy hour and Sundays! =)
Tomo Japanese Cuisine=I was first introduced to Tomos in celebration of my brother and my girlfriend's birthday.  Since then, it has become my favorite sushi joint in the west valley!Tomos keeps their restaurant dimly lit and there's plenty of bar space [sushi and alcohol] available.  I've only been here for dinner so I have yet experienced their lunch or Happy Hour special but I can't imagine those being anything less than delicious.  For appetizers, their monkey balls, soft shell crab, the ninja jalapenos, and oyster shooters are delicious [warning:  raw quail egg].  Some of my favorite rolls are the Passion of Fire [pity they don't bring this lit on fire anymore], the Dysart Roll, Crunch Roll, Cowboy Roll, Dragon Roll, Spider Roll, and Popcorn Lobster.  The sashimi is always thickly cut and Ocean Salad is great too.Tomos is the best sushi you can get in the west valley!
Lemongrass Café=I've never expected great decor from Vietnamese eateries, but a Viet restaurant inside in 50's style diner is something I've never thought I'd see.  It's strange but understandable after the economic crash and restaurants closing over night causing property owners to rent out space quickly and cheaply.Lemongrass is the exact place where you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.  It serves up some of the most authentic everyday Vietnamese dishes, there are even a couple of specialties I've never seen anywhere else in Vegas.There are the standard Pho noodle soups, vermicelli noodle salads, and Banh Mi sandwiches, which allow me to never have to drive to Chinatown if I have a craving for the usual fare.But if you're a non-Vietnamese and have never had something besides the dishes listed above, let me draw your attention to a few Viet offerings that are less-known but just as delicious:1. Stuffed Calamari: fresh squid stuffed with minced glass noodle, shrimp, and ground pork and then deep fried.  This dish is time-consuming to make and doesn't yield too much profit (which explains why I've mainly had it home-made) but completely yummy.2.  Tuna in Tomato Sauce: a peasant favorite that stands the test of time; it brings me back to the days of when my grandma used to cook this for me.  It sounds simple and it is: tuna filets are fried and then topped with crushed tomatoes with garlic and basil.  Simplicity in peasant food is usually what makes it so emotional.3.  Lotus Salad: usually seen at parties, a rare exception (we don't have too many salads) in Vietnamese cuisine that works.  Thin pieces of lotus stems are mixed with jicama, pork, shrimp, and mint, then topped with roasted peanuts and served with tamarind fish sauce.  A healthy alternative as an appetizer or main entree.You never forget your first love or your first.....time. This is where I nervously had my Pho cherry popped a while ago so it has always been special to me. Let's just say my first time was A-MAZING and I fell in love with Pho and Lemongrass Cafe on that day.- It's always hot and spicy - Cures hangovers and helps with head colds - No noodle and all white meat action works with my low carb lifestyle - While it travels from my pallet to my belly the warmth brings me peace and calm......a Culinary Nirvana. - Using chopsticks makes me happy (it's the small things in life) After being to several other Vietnamese spots Lemongrass is my go to for Chicken Pho. All white meat, fresh veggies, and a small that I cannot finish is $6.95. I usually get mine without the noodles and extra side of peppers and load it up with hoisin and chili sauce, etc. They never skimp on the amount of meat or it's quality. It's quite simply, Pho done right. I would also like to live a little and try a fried egg Banh Mi here eventually. The service is consistantly attentive, friendly, and quick. The owner always greets me with a smile and welcomes me. I especially enjoy this when I am here by myself in sweaty gym clothes which is frequent. (Yes, I am the sweaty white girl in the corner. Don't hate. My Pho is spicier than yours.) The restaurant is always very clean down to the ladle spoons and ramekins for the sauce if you are a dipper;) I would gladly give Lemongrass 5 stars, but my one issue is that the temperature never seems right in here. I purposely keep a sweatshirt in my car just for Lemongrass in the event it's freezing. I've been there a few times where I hadn't been to the gym before, but the temperature was so "off" I had a fancy boob sweat line when I was done eating. I know, sexy. Now that it's not Africa hot outside I imagine I will be craving Pho more than my average twice a week. TRUST I will be at Lemongrass Cafe fo' sho' fo ' a hot bowl of Vietnamese goodness to soothe my soul and take me back to that happy place.....Random that it is in an old diner.  They have Heu tieu on the menu!  My favorite dish when I visit Vietnam.  Not nearly as good here, but the closest I've gotten to it here at home.  The broth is a good flavor.  Thin clear noodles. The seafood in it is not fresh so that is the main downfall.  I still like it better than pho. The pho tastes good.  The fresh spring rolls were very good and clean tasting. Had an overall good experience.
Tastings Wine Bar and Bistro=We decided to hit up the "Wine Down Wednesday" that was happenin' at Tastings courtesy of KYOT.  Here's what went wrong:The event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held.We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby.20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine.It's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um, you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago...By now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much, but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.  By now, the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts, get some apps, and have our own "Wine Down Wednesday" at home.I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily, but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food, but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However, any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of "if I could give them less than 1 star I would" comes in...Oh yeah, and I slapped down a "You've been Yelped" card as I left.Take that Tastings!!
The Estate House=The only thing that could've possibly made my meal at The Estate House any worse, is if we had to pay for it...My bf and I stopped by for a drink on the night of their grand opening about 2 weeks ago... it was beautiful and the staff was pleasant; many of them my bf knew from previous workplaces.  So, he decided to have his birthday dinner there.  BIG MISTAKE!The meal we had last night was a comedy of errors... First off, there were 12 of us there and the way that they sat us (in the Butler's Pantry) was not ideal for our group.  We took things into our own hands and pushed our 2 tables together to make it easier to talk amongst ourselves.  Although Roman (I think that was our waiter's name) had good intentions, our service was horrendous!  We had to ask for menus after a half hour of being seated.  We had to ask for bread several times before it arrived probably an hour later, and then some of us (like myself) never even received any bread.  We also had to ask for water and drink refills throughout the 3 HOURS we were there...The menu itself was extremely pricey and fairly limited.  Not only that, but the menu lists a special 'tasting menu' but somehow it wasn't available yet... nor were there any specials.  We all finally decided and were able to place our order.One thing that the staff was good at was clearing and bringing back fresh silverware.  I think they moved my silverware around 3 times even though I would've been good with just one set.  Since they cleared my silverware that I hadn't touched before appetizers were finally served, I had no fork even if I wanted to sample from someone else's order... The Wild Arugula Salad that was supposed to arrive with "Warm Camembert," toasted marcona almonds and  blood orange vinaigrette arrived cold and all 3 people that ordered it had to send it back... other appetizers that arrived and some of the people in our party ate were the mussels and the winter squash risotto.  So, like I said, our reservation was for 7:30 and we were all seated by 7:45... so, when I looked at my watch and saw it was after 9:30. I was a little bit disappointed that our entrees weren't there yet.  After all, we were planning on meeting some other friends for drinks after dinner, and this was taking a really long time.  I think that everyone else at the table was feeling the same way.  We were all hungry and antsy and upset that the waiter or GM hadn't even acknowledged that it was taking a ridiculously long time.  So, the birthday boy spoke up... and asked for the GM.  I think it took another 30 minutes before the GM came over and acknowledged us.  Note - the food was still not there.  He was reactive instead of proactive apologizing but not offering anything.  He asked what we wanted him to do and we all just said to bring our food!  At this point it was 10pm.  He promised it would be there in 5 minutes.  Ron (another member of our group) looked at his watch and 5 minutes later, still no food.  Roman attempted to bring us a bottle of wine, but we didn't even want more to drink at this point...So, at about 10:10. our food began to arrive in piece meal...  2-3 entrees at a time and several minutes apart.  Many of the entrees were overcooked and had to be sent back and the person that ordered marlin was served tuna by accident so when the person that ordered the tuna didn't have her meal, we figured out their mistake.  The waiter then had the audacity to ask the person that ordered the tuna if she wanted a new one.  (There was already a bite taken out of the tuna that was served in error).  Of course she did!  Unfortunately, we were all done 20 minutes later when the new tuna finally arrived.  I had the "Estate House Fruit De Mer" which was actually pretty good.  (However, at 10pm, anything would've been good in my eyes).  We basically had to tell the GM that there was no way we were going to pay for this horrendous meal... you would think we'd get apologies again or something, but no.  We left a decent tip for Roman, and never even had birthday cake for the birthday boy... bummer!  At that point we just wanted to get the hell out of there!Fortunately, we had much better service upstairs at the 3rd floor level bar where they had a piano player until 11pm.  We met some other friends there and attempted to laugh at the miserable meal we'd just had... Side note - Charles Barkley and his wife were also at the restaurant and had a 3 hour meal as well - we know this because we swapped stories over drinks upstairs after the fact.The Estate House has a lot of kinks to work on... I doubt I will ever return to eat there again... I do recommend going for the ambiance and drinks on the top level.  Gina and Bill will take good care of you there... Aside from that, I would tell you to save your time and $$.Two years is a long time... I had the FTR for this restaurant over two years ago.  It was the worst review I've ever written for any business.  If you'd asked me two years ago to return to The Estate House, there was no way I'd say yes.But in two years, this place has really come a long way... I believe the three star bump I'm giving to my original review is thanks to Zoran, the GM, Chef Gio Osso, and a crew of friendly and attentive staff.  The Estate House is still as beautiful as I remember it being in February 2008, but it's perhaps even more beautiful now that they've got the ambiance, cuisine, and service to go with the physical beauty.My evening kicked off with a little mixer on the outdoor third floor patio.  Service was fantastic and drinks were strong.  I corresponded with guests at the mixer, but also with many of the Estate House staff.  From there, I went downstairs for a lovely dinner with my husband.  While the menu is still on the fancy side for me, I was pleased with everything from the appetizers to the dessert.  We ordered the Burrata and Scallop appetizers, and were served way too much fresh bread to start as well... Turns out they were out of Burrata but replaced it with the smoothest, creamiest, largest pillow of Mozzarella I've ever had.  We cleaned both plates.  Jared went with the Moroccan Seven Spice Grilled Lamb entree and I chose the Honey Saba Lacquered Black Cod.  Both were unique preparations with a ton of flavor.  I could've done without the candied pancetta on the cod, but that didn't stop me from eating way too much.  In addition, we had grilled asparagus and sauteed spinach... (the greens balance out everything else, right?!)We were stuffed but were joined by a couple of friends for dessert and shared the bread pudding and a chocolate peanut butter special... both were fabulous.  All of this while enjoying a bottle of wine.Needless to say, I am extremely happy I gave The Estate House another shot.  They've come a long way in two years, and I anticipate returning again soon.  I encourage you to do the same.**They are now open for lunch (which I must say looks very reasonable), and they have all kinds of special events including Cooking Classes, Easter Brunch, Simple Sunday Dinners, etc...I ate here during Restaurant Week and it was acceptable. The setting is lovely, without question. The decor is impeccable! But, the food was just OK. If it wasn't Restaurant Week pricing, I think I would've been disappointed. I had the rock shrimp ceviche which was topped with too much mediocre guacamole. The swordfish was simple and cooked very well. Simple is a good thing with fish, in my opinion. It had good flavor. I really enjoyed the tomatoes that accompanied it.  The fingerling potatoes were acceptable (though, they could have used a bit more seasoning). My dessert, Baba au Rhum, was OK. I notice none of these items, except the fingerlings, are on the regular menu but it seems you'd put your best foot forward during Restaurant Week, when you can count on some new customers who have been looking for an excuse to try your restaurant to seize the moment. In this case, they didn't create a new regular.
NYPD Pizza=Working late one night, I was looking for some Pizza delivery and found this place on Yelp.  After browsing their menu online, I decided to order a 14" Brooklyn Family Pizza (Sausage, Pepperoni, Basil, $15.79) well done.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WScGH9XsG8-XF_HLqviAgw?select=tJ6uKGCt903Th6DBV33z4gThe Pizza was delivered pretty quickly and I couldn't wait to take a bite.  The Pizza looked sooo good!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WScGH9XsG8-XF_HLqviAgw?select=RbJzxEMNjbizWpuurVp5lgWhen I picked up a Slice, it had that NY Pizza "bend" to it.....good sign!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WScGH9XsG8-XF_HLqviAgw?select=p1vayQYRY2Eync2nFsXo8QI took a bite and it was good!  The Sausage had a nice combination of Sweet & Spicy flavors and went well with the Pepperoni.  The Cheese was gooey and the Basil was just right...I think I'm going to add Basil to my standard order of Pepperoni & Sausage if a Pizza joint offers it.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WScGH9XsG8-XF_HLqviAgw?select=Mi2V4PgUyxU-PQGwDQRBtAOverall, I was very satisfied with NYPD Pizza!Return Factor - 100%
Caffè Italia=Busy, loud, lively, fast, somewhat chaotic - that's how I would describe Caffè Italia. A cafe that doesn't try to pretend to be what it's not and stays true to what it is - a historic icon where local patrons in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s+ drop in for their espresso, dunk their panettone, watch some sports, pay (cash) and then leave to carry on their day.Open from 7am till 11pm this place just never seems to stop. Sitting at the bar you'll often see an order of 10 or more cups that come all at once! Amazingly no words are exchanged between waiters and the Barrista. I was trying to decode the system, a combo of saucer, glass spoons and positions that minimizes the need to talk and focus on delivery! Spoon in cup means decaf, two spoons on plate is an allongé, spoon down is double shot, etc.Tip: Don't try to sit at the corner table unless you're looking for dirty looks. This where the older italian men hang out to talk about soccer, politics and sometimes about weather. "Keep it real is what it's all about... Montrealers like it like that" I was told by a regular. You won't see any fancy foam art but the crema is thick, exactly what you would expect from fresh coffee beans being hit at the right temperature and 12 bars of pressure. All drinks are very reasonably priced: Espresso at $1.75 and Latte or Cappuccino at $2.75!  Food-wise staples are mortadella, capicollo or salami sandwiches, toasts with choice of jam, peanut butter or Nutella and your traditional variety of italian sweets. Interestingly enough, behind the counter, where cigarettes packs used to be displayed, you can get hard to find Italian men grooming items such as Proraso (Italy #1 shaving cream), Felce Azzura (Talc Powder) and Pastel del Capitano (italian toothpaste).The original owner is a nice lady who just recently celebrated her 76th birthday. She inherited the cafe from her parents who moved from Italy and opened this place when she was 16! The place is now run by her two daughters backed by a clever Barista (Paolo) and staff that crack you up if you pay attention to what they are saying. No frills, no fuss just good caffè - this is what it's all about.
Chill=Sometimes you just dont get what you pay for. Like paying nearly 5 bucks for a large frozen yogurt and getting a less then half full cup. Then a buck for the first topping which was so stingy. I chose mochi and seriously, there were about 6 pieces. Were not talking quality over quantity here.. the frozen yogurt was good, very light sour yogurt taste, not much tang. I make the same recipe at home and its good but not 6 bucks a cup good. Maybe the lady there at Chill saw my fat ass and decided that she needed to put me on a diet! I did have a taste of the gelato and thought it was really good.. I think if I go here again I will certainly stick with the gelato.. seems that those cups are literally packed. You live you learn.People often make the mistake of assuming I know what I'm doing. That I'm a woman with a plan. It's an easy error to make; I'm a somewhat articulate woman working towards a bachelor's degree who holds multiple state credentials. Yeah, I guess a certificate with a photocopied signature on it can count as credentials, right? But in reality, there is no method to the madness. Like a jazz soloist or a Republican defending anti-gay marriage laws, I'm just making this shit up as I go along. I am often overwhelmed by seemingly trivial decisions, like "what color should I paint my nails today" or "should I give this place 1 or 2 stars?" Places like Coldstone or Baskin Robbins, therefore, frustrate me to no end.Do I get a flavor I know I'll like? Or do I branch out? But what if that flavor's totally nasty and I can't finish it? What mix-ins should I get? Oh god there are people in line behind me, make up your mind, voice in my head!!!When Amanda B brought me to Chill, the first thing I noticed was the wide array of gelato flavors. Immediately, I felt myself paralyzed with indecision. Oh shit. Pineapple and Coconut? Dulce de Leche? Sweet Zombie Jesus, they have a Twix flavor! Oh Eris, goddess of cha--oh wait, you wouldn't do me any good in this situation, would you?Off-handed, perhaps sensing my panic, Amanda's sister Allison grinningly said to me "you've got to try the chocolate pistachio. It's the best."At first I was a little hesitant to take her suggestion. While chocolate is awesome and pistachio is awesome, 2 x awesome does not always awesome squared. Other examples of two awesome things that suck when put together; Babies and movie theaters. Girlfriends and strip clubs. Roleplaying games (fuck yeah I slayed a dragon!) and the internet (sorry guys, I can't go out tonight, gotta stay home and do a raid with my guild).But Allison assured me that this would be all the chocolatey pistachio goodness I could ever ask for. I was sold. Legend has it that once, an Italian merchant once gave Buddha a bowl of gelato. Buddha was so delighted with the dessert that he reciprocated the gesture and gave the merchant a book of Buddhist teachings to bring back with him to Italy. Unfortunately the merchant's ship was sunk on the voyage home, and Buddhism didn't reach Italy for hundreds of years.What does that have to do with my review? Nothing. The chocolate pistachio really was amazing. And at 2.59 for a small it has a reasonable cost/delicious ratio (I'm assuming anyway. Allison covered me in the event I didn't like mine so she could finish it herself). I may not be as well versed in the art and science of gelato as others, but I can tell you from my limited experience that it was creamy, chocolatey, smooth, nutty and everything I am told gelato is supposed to be. Maybe next time I will choose a flavor by myself. But I wouldn't count on it. I was late for work today because I couldn't decide which pair of pink flip flops would better match my Sarah Jessica Parker jeans. I am completely flabbergasted as to how I get out as much as I do.08/31/11Stumbled onto Chill while exploring the area before settling down for dinner (at Lobby's).  The clerk here was friendly and accommodating w/ sample requests.  After dinner, I came back and ordered a cup of three flavors: dark chocolate, chocolate sugar-free, and panna cotta.  I was delighted w/ all of them!  Surprisingly, my favorite of the three flavors I'd ordered was the one I had not sampled beforehand, the sugar-free chocolate.  I definitely will be back!Psst!  Don't forget to take a loyalty card w/ you, as she may forget to mention it!
Tim Finnegan's Irish Restaurant and Pub=Irish pubs are really my favorite places to eat, drink, and be merry.  Last Friday we knew we were meeting Tim S. for dinner at Cibo, so why not leave the 'burbs and go try some other places I have bookmarked on Yelp and just make a day of it?  Tim Finnegan's was on the list and we had a great lunch.  We started with the mussels app which had some of the best broth I've ever had with mussels.  It was a little spicy, but not too much, and they put noodles in there which I've never seen before, but they soaked up the broth very nicely and made the meal more substantial.  I also really like the brown bread that came with it.  Mr. M ordered the lunch portion fish and chips and I ordered the Rasher burger.  You know the food is good when there is very little talking, just eating.  That's what we did for the next 20 minutes, passing bites of fish and burger across our plates to each other and sharing the fries and green beans.  All perfectly done all the way around.  The fish was nice and light with very tasty fries.  My burger was really exceptional and on par with the great burgers I've had at Fibber Magees and Skeptical Chymist.  Some of the best burgers I've had in this city were at places that don't market themselves as a burger joint.  With a pint of Kilkenny, Guinness, and sharing one of Harp, our total before tax and tip was $36.23.  They have a great Yelp check-in deal and you can get the appetizer for free if you purchase two entrees.    I loved the atmosphere with all the dark wood and small tables and booths.  Kristen took good care of us at the bar and we enjoyed her banter with some of the regular patrons.  I wish we lived closer to Tim Finnegan's, but now that we've given it a try, we'll be back for sure.
Red House=I am shocked by these reviews.  Has anyone ever tasted their tasteless egg drop soup?  Has anyone ever tasted their mushy fried rice (of late) ?  Has anyone ever tasted their tasteless beef?  I am amazed by these reviews.  and this is NOT NY chinese food!  I don't know what it is.
The Herb Box=Recently opened, this new Herb Box location is doing some business!  I went for lunch today with a friend, and we had to wait 30 minutes to get seated!  Aside from the hostesses being a bit clueless (they didn't know if the menu at this location was the same as the other or not), we enjoyed our meal.The location used to be Cafe Citron - they did a great job fixing it up.  One side is the eatery and the other is the market... and an outdoor patio is a plus!  They've still got some kinks to work on with service, but the food is just as good as the other location; especially those sweet potato chips!My friend had the 'Urban Market Steak Salad' and I have to say, it looked much better than my 'Albacore Tuna Salad Pita' was... I think that the rent may be higher in this location since the menu prices seemed even higher than those at the other location too.  Not positive though.  I recommend this place if you don't mind spending $12 - $20 on lunch... amazing sweet potato chips, chicken chile, sandwiches, salads, and baked goods too.  I'm sure they do a great job with catering, but I don't know that from experience, just a hunch.I found another winner today on the menu at Herb Box... I changed it up a bit and ordered the Market Veggie Pita; it was really good too!  Inside a light pita wrap was a combo of garden salad & red pepper hummus... it came with my fave sweet potato chips and a side of grapes.  All for $9.  Add an iced tea and it's a wonderful lunch!  I also noticed another new addition to the menu at this location:  the Crisp Coconut Shrimp Salad; i'll have to remember to try that next time!I also have to remember to try herb box for dinner - I haven't been yet, but the menu looks fantastic!I sat at the bar with my friend and had attentive service from Joy... We would've had to wait for a table, but the bar worked out well.  Still a huge fan of the Herb Box - if you haven't been, go!Herb Box- DC Ranch is my new fav eatery for organic, locally grown, tasty lunches!Yesterday we took to the kids and started off with their mango (or papaya- I get the two confused) lemonade.  REALLY sweet, but a cool exotic flavor.  BTW, it is great to find a place that welcomes kids without being a true "kids restaurant".  Couples, singles, families, you name it- you've got the gamut of customers here.We had the BBQ Chicken Flat-bread Pizza and Free Range chicken-arugula wrap with candied walnuts and cranberries.  Today (yeah it was so good we had to come back a day later) had the Market Street Tacos- with fillet, fresh avocados, and some sort of what I call "magic sauce" while the kids split the turkey on a cibata (sp?) sandwich.  Hooooooly cow!!  Imagine an explosion of flavors (all wonderful) sparking in your mouth at once.  it is like a symphony of flavors- each one distinct yet complementary to the other.  Honest to goodness magic to your taste buds.  Of course a restaurant review could never get 5 stars unless it has great service- which it did.  But it also had a little something extra.  Great atmosphere, AMAZING food, and a highly textured (and blended femininity and masculinity) decor.  And the overall vibe was very cool.  Not too snotty (even though some of the customers are), relaxed, and open feeling push the Herb Box over the top to receive a 5 star rating.  I don't know what they serve (or if they are even open for breakfast or dinner), but for lunch, this is a perfect choice.  Now that I've belatedly discovered the location in DC Ranch (their Shea location had catered for us before), you will see me here more often.  Hopefully you will enjoy it as much as my family and I do!  Best wishes.Warmly,Kirin :)****this review is based on breakfast menu only************** Since I love the lunch and dinner soo much I thought I would go for Sunday brunch. First off they had a horrible selection of breakfast, they dont even serve french toast or omelets or breakfast sandwiches. They had a egg breakfast, which is what I got. Consisted of 2 eggs with cheese and bacon and tomato and avocado slices on the side. First off I give it 1 star for appearance. It looked worse that what I could have made at home. The bacon was soggy the eggs were looking like neon yellow and clearly a boxed egg. (which should not be the case with a place like herb box for 9 buck for box eggs and soggy bacon) I could have made it way better at home Jamie got the buckwheat pancakes since they didn't have an option to have buttermilk. The pancakes were super super dry and almost gritty. It said it came with strawberries... I'm not kidding you it was a half strawberry cut in 3 small pieces. It also had dried blueberries which were actually soo gross I could not believe they would not use the fresh ones. Aside from that the only other thing on the menu was custard donut and hot cocoa for 9 bucks wtf? a 9 dollar donut. a bowl of oatmeal for 6 bucks breakfast burrito which the guy next to us got and he took it back. He said it was litterally egg and dry black beans unseasonedI saw the size and it was like 2 breakfast taquitos.There where like 2 more things but I cant think of itIf you want the breakfast herbox should have go to arcadia farms.Yeah ! I am happy to find this as good as had hoped , boo it's  really a trek and not on  my paper route as dear ABU would say. In the quaint  DC Ranch  set aglow with beautiful white lights sits this yummy  bistro/market . We were tempted by many great looking items on the menu but settled for the pizza. It was  delicious. Both the Cappicola Pizza as well as the Gorgonzola and Pear pizza  tasted outstanding. Both possessed a certain pizzazz that made you want more.  The food that we saw ordered around us made us wish we had room for more just to try out the many small dishes we saw come out. Can't wait to go back!Since my sister's recent move, I've been finding myself up at DC Ranch more often and I was happy to see that The Herb Box was till alive and kicking! I like this location because it feels almost like you are in a small vacation town on the river, like a Sun River, Oregon and enjoying the weather and atmosphere with some refreshing and pretty healthy food. The menu here is the same as the other location and I really enjoy the wraps, Cesar salad (with Chicken added), coconut shrimp salad, hummus, enchiladas and pretty much everything else! When I eat here, I like to sit on the patio and soak in the sunlight, but the interior is just as refreshing as well. That's about all I have to say since everyone else has pretty much said it all. This is a great restaurant option for lunch with friends or dinner with a date.I had an "herb box" in college I remember. Kept it under my bed. Or in the back of the closet. Or in a shoe. Gee, that was some herb I can't even remember...This Herb Box however, I shan't ever forget!!!Butternut Squash Enchiladas. White Bean Chicken Chili. Crab Cilantro Dip. The Zucchini soup of the day...ALL...outstanding!!!Now that I've moved back to DC Ranch I'm so glad to see the Herb Box and even more excited that this is my new "Cheers". Sorry Gallo Blanco, though I miss you madly...I've found another relationship. And no it's not complicated!Quite simple in fact. Delicious, fresh ingredients. Delightful, warm staff and a cozy and bright spot on Market Street.I've been here with family. With friends. And even a date. Herb Box, if I stick around AZ long enough, I just may ask you to marry me!So step outside of your "box" and head to The Herb Box. But call me first and I will meet you there!!!Herb Box is always delicious and meow, I can add a delicious breakfast experience to my repertoire! While in DC Ranch during the breakfast hour, I was happy to learn that the DC Ranch Herb Box location serves breakfast on both Saturday and Sunday (not just Sunday like the Old Town location). I ordered the breakfast burrito with egg whites and avocado. The meal was fresh and filling but not overly heavy. The environment is casual but classy and perfect for any type of diner, whether it be a family or friends. When the weather's nice, they have the perfect patio where you can enjoy a Mimosa with your meal!6/9/13My first visit at this Herb Box location- didn't know it was so much closer to where I live than that one at Southbridge!  Decided to sit outside since it was so noisy indoors** and especially when the misters were on full blast outside.  [The misters were both a blessing and a curse- while they did cool the area, the water did have a certain odor to them (a manager at another resto previously warned me not to park my car close to their misters, since the water contained erosive compounds), and I didn't want whatever was added to the water to contaminate my food and drinks.)  Ordered water and green tea with blackberry and jasmine essences http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-herb-box-scottsdale-6?select=ACjM4QrTvrI6Og5q-cQNSg#ACjM4QrTvrI6Og5q-cQNSg and the Blackened salmon BLT. The unsweetened tea was clean-tasting and refreshing, and was a welcome palate cleanser after I had my fill of the terrific salmon BLT, which came with two juicy filets of wild-caught salmon, wild arugula, tomato, smoked applewood bacon, and red pepper aioli on toasted ciabatta, plus a side of house-made sweet potato chips. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-herb-box-scottsdale-6?select=MQz07Ic5tPQfAjnVVqnurg#MQz07Ic5tPQfAjnVVqnurg  It took a lot of willpower not to eat more than half of the sandwich (I actually sliced a tiny portion off of the second-half- tsk, tsk!), but in hindsight, a half-portion plus some SPC satisfied until late happy hour/early dinner.  Afterwards, I asked my server if it would be safe to leave my Kindle on the table while I go wash my hands, and she said yes.  When I went back outside to do a bit of reading, I noticed the umbrella over my table was removed and my boxed leftovers, beverages, and e-reader were on another table- what the - ?  Were they in such a rush to see me off?  I could understand the busser mistakenly thinking I'd forgotten the food, but seeing the e-reader would've clued him/her of the possibility that I was returning, so one would think that the items would still be on the original table when I returned, so why were they moved to another AND the umbrella taken away?  The other tables still had umbrellas overhead... Very strange.  I also realized that I didn't have time to read after glancing at my watch, and with bill on hand, I tried to pay at the register by the pastry case, since my server was busy taking care of other customers outside, but the bartender (whom I asked if I could get some assistance at the register) and manager (?), whom the bartender motioned to come over, became confused, until my server rushed indoors to ask me what was going on.  I said I didn't know it was so late, that I needed to make it to an appointment in Tempe in 20 minutes, so I was trying to find someone else to help me with the bill.  She said only she could take care of it, and that it needed to be done at the bar.  OK, whatever you need to do, I just had to get going!  (I started to wonder if they thought I was going to rush out without paying?!)Besides these few glitches in service, I'd otherwise give four stars.  Maybe next visit will be better...**It was lunchtime, but by no means packed with people, so I wondered why it was so noisy?This venue is so incredibly cute, especially at night! Its right next to the Grayhawk golf course and has quite the "upscale" feel to it, even though it is a smaller location and very affordable.  This is the perfect place for date night, yet, if youre coming in on the weekend, I would suggest making a reservation. I like the menu style with the "farm to table" feel. The menu has a "healthier" look to it, but you dont sacrifice flavor thats forsure. When I went... I ordered the Smoked Gouda Mac and cheese with garlic breadcrumbs...(NEED I SAY MORE!?) and Thai style ribs that just fell off the bone. These really were the best ribs I've ever had, with a different flavor which was refreshing. I've had good BBQ ribs before, but this was a whole different twist. I would definitely recommend it. They have an outdoor patio and sometimes play live acoustic music... not quite sure when though, I forgot which weekdays. I've only been here for the dinners, but I would love to come back for their breakfast... also heard they have an amazing brunch on sundays.
California Pizza Kitchen=After visiting The container Store for a longer span of time than we thought we would, it was high time for dinner.  Eyeballing the several offerings of Town Square, we came across this California Pizza Kitchen.  There was a wait everywhere on this Friday night, but here it didn't appear to be intolerable.  So, we put in our name and waited to be called.  After about 20 minutes the lights on our pager finally glowed red and danced about.  Now hungrier than ever, we prepared to settle in our comfortable booth and enjoy a multi-course dinner at a relaxed pace.  We were not ready to rumble, but to EAT!So, I began with Minced Chicken Lettuce Wraps, while Diane looked forward to an opening side of Traditional Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese.  The Lettuce Wraps were excellent, featuring fine chicken, tiny curved water chestnuts, jalapeno circles, very fresh and crisp lettuce leaves, and a nice soy-based spicy dipping sauce.  I did find though that the Cherry Limeade I also ordered was too strong for my taste.The Mac 'N' Cheese had an excellent crisp crust, and was firm on the inside--not mushy.  The whole dish was quite yummy.Unfortunately our Garlic Cream Fettuccine entrees then arrived right on top of our starters.  I sent mine back, but Diane accepted hers, which contained sauteed chicken and shrimp.  When my entree arrived again at a more suitable time, it was just like Diane's, except mine was further enhanced by sauteed mushrooms.  The sauteing was first-rate, the fettuccine was al dente, and just enough Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce clung to the pasta to make this a truly delectable dish.  The portions were large, with an ample amount of chicken breast chunks and medium- to large-sized shrimps.  We both enjoyed our hot entrees immensely.But how is a fine dinner truly complete without a sumptuous dessert?  So, I finished with a towering slice of 6-layer Lemon Cake with Lemon Custard Filling, while Diane dug into a large slice of 5-layer Red Velvet Cake.  My high-caloric sweet treat was brushed with Limoncello, candied lemon zest, and Mascarpone Frosting, and was very lemony and delicious.  Diane's was topped by a creamy and very tasty Cream Cheese Frosting.  We were both in dessert nirvana.One other service delay must be mentioned.  Diane seemed to wait forever for a Hot Chocolate.  We were ultimately told by both our server and the manager that the bartender on duty makes all Hot Chocolate drinks, and got behind making that and other ordered drinks.  Finally, the manager hustled over to our table with the Hot Chocolate way late, but did take it off the bill.  And then Diane found it to be too thin.Even though our dining experience was marred by two service errors, the food was so delicious that we just brushed these minor inconveniences aside, and this outing still rated an overall 4-1/2 stars!I had a gift card and decided to place an order for pick-up. This CPK is located in Town Square. There is a pick-up door, but if there is parking near it I couldn't find it. Crowded is the proper word for Town Square! With no parking spot in sight and tons of people wandering around, hubby dropped me off out front. I was greeted when I walked in and the food was ready. The pizza came in a to-go carrier with handles that was very convenient. I ordered the "Untraditional Cheese Pizza" priced at $9.75 that was cheesy and good. Most pizzas with more than one cheese have a smokey type of cheese on it and this one didn't, which I loved. Simple and good! You can place your pick-up order over the phone or online. The online ordering is very user friendly.California Pizza Chicken... in Nevada!! (get your own pizza chicken  ....)Went here for my cousins graduation dinner with a party of about 17, and we all ended up sitting outside in the patio, SEPARATELY. It would have been nicer if they could have seated all of us at one big table formed by many little ones, instead separating the whole family. ;(I ended up sitting with my dad and uncle, both who ordered fish tacos while I ordered the wild mushroom pizza. All which came with complimentary bread and oil. Let me cut to the chase:- WILD MUSHROOM PIZZAI was very disappointed after trying this pizza. The crust may have been perfectly soft, but for 13.99? I don't think so. It was not even that good.- FISH TACOSI stole one of my dad's fish taco's and thought they were bomb. The two avocado slices helped finish me off into oblivion. However, the tortilla and fish was a little to dry for me.- BREAD AND OILAll though these were complimentary, I actually enjoyed eating these more than the pizza and tacos. The bread might have been a little too hard on the outside, but it was so dam soft on the inside. Combined with the oil, I would have been fine just eating this instead of the main dishes!!- SERVICEI think something was wrong with our server.. She told me that my pizza will be out "shortly". I soon realized she said that 20 minutes ago. 20 minutes is not short!!!!My uncle also asked for a refill for his beer, which ended up taking 10 minutes to refill -_-. She didn't even apologize!!I don't have a review for CPK yet?? Oh no, gotta change that. Their Townsquare location is the main one I visit since it's the closest to home and since Townsquare always has a nice feel with all the trees and everything. Let's start with service, sometimes it's a hit or miss with the servers but generally pretty good. One thing that they're really good at is keeping wait times low even though it gets crazy.Onto the food! I've loved everything I've tried here except for their Jambalaya Pasta. That dish scarred me Lol idk if they made it wrong or something but that just had a horrible flavor. I had my boyfriend taste it too and he said it was pretty bad Lol. But thankfully that's the only bad thing I've had.My current favorites are the Avocado Club Eggrolls, Cedar Plank Salmon, Tequila Fettucine, Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza & Pear/Gorgonzola Pizza on Hand-Tossed Crust. I'm not a fan of thin crust at all so I'm happy that they can make any of the thin-crust pizzas on regular hand-tossed.Now their Butter Cake with Haagen Daaz ice cream deserves it's own paragraph. Oh my Goodness. I remember the first time being introduced to it, We wanted a dessert but didn't know which one to go with and our waitress was like, "You're not true CPK Fans till you've given our Butter Cake a try." This cake is life changing lmao. Super warm and soft and sweet but not too sweet. It's a little hard to describe the flavors but whatever you do, just get it.I've also ordered to-go many times and everytime, the pizza, salads, etc were all the same quality as you would get dining there. They're also really amazing at giving utensils, napkins, fresh bread, and parmesan/hot pepper flakes without even asking! Forever a regular!I think the last time I went to a California Pizza Kitchen was at least 4 years ago in Michigan! Surprisingly I haven't gone to the one in Town Square, however, that changed today. One of my girlfriends wanted to catch up with a light lunch and recommended we go here.We shared the Tortilla Spring Rolls as an app - you can choose from 3 different kinds and we got the Mediterranean Veggie and the Thai Chicken (Baja Chicken is the third choice). Three small portions of each came out with a marinara sauce for the veggie and a sweet peanut sauce for the thai spring rolls. They were both pretty tasty and a great way to start our lunch. I wanted a salad and went with the half portion of the Waldorf Chicken Salad and my friend got the half portion of the Moroccan Chicken Salad. The half portions are humongous and look like a full portion to me. Perfect size for lunch. My salad was incredibly delicious! Mixed greens with grapes, green apples, celery, chicken, candied walnuts, crumbled Gorgonzola, pre-tossed in a light vinaigrette. I wouldn't recommend getting this salad if you don't like Gorgonzola because as you know, it has a strong distinct taste and can be overpowering in any dish. I didn't mind at all because I LOVE cheese and Gorgonzola. Katie was our server and she was fantastic! Very friendly and checked up on us quite often to make sure we were enjoying everything and to refill our drinks.I'm very satisfied with my lunch today and would gladly go back! Highly recommend California Pizza Kitchen if you're in Town Square and craving a fresh salad. I'll have to try their pizza next time.You're getting average food for an inflated price...I usually know what to expect when I walk into certain restaurants and especially in certain locations - this is one of those restaurant and locations. CPK is generally overpriced for the portion of food you'll get. However, my previous experience has been that the quality of the food is decent. Well, it was marginal on this recent visit. Our Chinese Chicken Salad was $14.79 each and they were drenched in dressing. The salads were wilted messes. We were served some French bread with oil for our salad that was pretty good though.The service was pleasant.Being a strip location tucked in Town Square, I will forgive the "suggested gratuity" section on my check. Unfortunately, CPK makes their suggested-gratuity amount to include sales tax. Gratuity is based on food and beverage and therefore should be "suggested" (if necessary) based on the subtotal, before tax.I've been to this California Pizza Kitchen on a few different occasions and I'm usually left noticing that the food isn't as consistent with other locations and that the service is usually lacking. Slow with refills and last time we were there they forgot all about my to go box and I had to remind her to bring it back. Luckily she forgot it on a shelf near the cash register.
Ago=Took the Better Half to dinner here last week.  Located in the Hard Rock Hotel, it's a nice atmosphere to have dinner.  I like the house music they were playing in the restaurant....that might be a turnoff for some people.After browsing the menu for a few minutes, we decided to order:AppetizersRavioli Margherita (Fresh Made Cheese Ravioli, Cherry Tomato Sauce, Basil, $11.00) - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ov68TVizW1d2Hqm2M2FKVg?select=9ihYtt7ILkL-XN6LFW6S9gMozzarella Caprese ai Peperoni Dolci (Imported Buffalo Mozzarella, Tomato, Organic Sweet Peppers, Basil, $14.00)Entrees4 Formaggi al Salamino Pizza (4 Cheeses, Italian Salami, $14.00) - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ov68TVizW1d2Hqm2M2FKVg?select=Pho84hX78bz0TuxnvFpfGwDel Pastore Pizza (Spicy Sausage, Goat Cheese, Organic Peppers, $14.00) - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ov68TVizW1d2Hqm2M2FKVg?select=rfL6qYQHYYFeHS4eXlirzwEverything was really good.  I especially enjoyed the Ravioli appetizer and the 4 Formaggi Pizza....they were outstanding!  The other two dishes were pretty good too, but didn't stand out like the others.  Of course we enjoyed our meal with a few glasses of Sangiovese ($11 ea)....yum.Service here was great and it was a nice dinner during our Staycation.Return Factor - 80%
Eduardo Duluth=We used to go here all the time as a gang of ravenous undergraduates because BYO and a huge inexpensive mound of pasta within walking distance of your tiny crowded apartment just makes sense at that age. I hadn't been back in a while but Matt and Cindy's recent UYE (unofficial yelp event) brought me back and made me realize that inexpensive mounds of good food at a BYO never stops being a good idea, and is especially wise on Mondays. I ordered the Surf and Turf because at $24 this has to be one of the cheapest quality deals for steak, shrimp and pasta in town. The pasta was fresh and the sauce pure cream and butter goodness. The shrimp were really good, not fishy at all, and the steak was kind of amazing, super tender, juicy and perfectly medium rare in a light wine gravy.All in all a very satisfying yummy meal made better by the vines and stained glass and the exceptionally adorable company.
Gyro Express=I was hopeful but it just wasn't that good.  I had the chicken pita (which they subtitle "shiwirma" on the menu) and steak sandwich.  Actually I shared them both.  And an order of fries.  And a piece of baklava.  Not balaclava.  Those taste fuzzy.So the chicken pita was ok, pretty much a three star kind of thing.  The steak sandwich was not as good.  It did not have enough meat or cheese and the bread was too heavy.  The meat was also not the best quality.The baklava was also only two star worthy.  Poor baklava is just a disappointment.  Skip it.Woah, holy shit, another place that sells Kronos Meat Cone products and calls itself the "best Gyros in town"... which, if true, means every other Gyro spot is also the best in town.  As Richard Christy would say, "It's mah faaavorite".  Food's good, quick service despite being hella-packed, I mean, line out the door packed.  The dude at the counter might have been mentally retarded... not like, drooling and slapping his chest retarded, but functionally retarded.  Anyway, $9 and some change gets you a huge plate of Kronos Meat Cone product, rice, salad, pita (or fries if you can get the mongoloid to understand your request), and a drink.
The Library=Lesson learned kids, listen to the almighty Yelpers.  They know what they're talkin' bout!I'd seen the good reviews and had read that other Yelpers got some tasty wings and burgers here.  Then why did I go for the risotto you ask??  I don't know, it looked good to me at the time, I'm sorry!  All the dinner items actually looked good.  My risotto...flavorless.  I needed pepper and salt desperately.  Too bad the server came around every 2 hours (I may be exaggerating a bit).  But the service was spotty.The saving grace was the enormous cheese plate we got as an app (good for AT LEAST 4 people) and the farfalle pasta with smoked gouda cream sauce my hubs got.  I quit my meal like a bad habit and ate most of his. That cheese sauce was divine!  And the cheese app had honey drizzled on top which really made the dish spectacular.  So 2 out of 3 dishes were winners.  I can accept that.The creativity just oozes out of this place.  It's a library type setting and as we sat down two big books were set in front of us.  I opened mine to find the menu.  How freakin' cute!  I looked over and noticed this large cook book sitting next to me and I thought "what the heck is that doing there?"  It was the other "menu" stuck in a cook book.  My book, I discovered, was about dragons.  Now I've eaten and learned about dragons.  Now that's multitasking!I absolutely want to go back for their $8 all you can eat wings to give them a try.  And Mel U is right, a Happy Hour special offered EVERY day is unheard of!  And pretty awesome!  Scarfin' down wings and drinkin' half price...I'm in!
Panna Thai Restaurant=This restaurant is just a pretty face with zero substance. Similar to an Australian male stripper I once met. Really nice to look at, but once he opened his mouth I couldn't run away fast enough. On to crappy Thai food.I walk in and am instantly taken back by how current and sharp this space is. They spent money in making it look appealing and it does! They were also playing some current American music which was unusual to me, but I liked it. Only one table was occupied by a couple when I placed my takeout order. The order taking was slightly awkward as I mentioned to the guy (because I am always entirely too friendly and can't help it. Unless I used expensive, yet bad moisturizer that is making my f*n face stink and the smell is killing me!), I mentioned that I have been dying to try this place.. He asked if I have ever had Thai food before. I wanted to ask him if he had ever brushed his teeth before. Again, I was nice about it. I placed my order for Panang chicken no rice and he then said," Medium or Mild". I responded with,"HOT". He gave me the look, but than wrote down my order. I paid and he said it would be a few minutes.....I don't mind waiting because I am in an especially good mood these days. The only couple in the restaurant pays and leaves. The music is turned off. The music never comes back on. I waited close to 30 minutes in silence for my order. I would have waited longer if I didn't get up and walk towards the kitchen. It had been sitting there for who knows how long. RUDE. I smile, grab my food and leave. Immediately I open the container upon walking in the door since I'm ravenous for some spicy curry. First impression- Panang sauce is really watery..... Second impression- Panang Chicken has tons of Thai chiles, but zero flavor other than heat. No basil or kaffir lime leaves. No complexity or richness to the sauce. Only pure coconut milk taste or lack of. Dinner fail. I really wanted to like this place and had hopes that this would be my new go to Thai spot for date night, but they just don't deliver on any level here. My suggestion is go anywhere else in the area for Thai unless you belong to a Coconut Milk Meetup Group or something. In that case knock yourself out. Literally.We were craving some Thai food but wanted to be "adventurous" and try something besides or usual neighborhood goto so I quickly browsed my bookmarked list and found Panna. I was hesitant at first because I heard their food was pretty Americanized but I'm glad we gave them a try.Called in and placed an order for pick up:Chicken satay entrée: comes with 6 nicely sized skewers of seasoned chicken, fried rice, salad and peanut sauce. Really good and nicely priced at around $12 a great shareable dish!Beef and asparagus: YUMMM the beef was so tender and the asparagus still had a nice crunch to it! Good brown sauce that was not too salty and MUSHROOMS!!! MmmmChicken Pad Thai: Meh. This was not good.. The noodles were way too soft and overcooked... the dish overall was too sweet. The 2 yummy dishes made us forget about the 1 meh dish.. Portion sizes and prices are good...We will definitely be back!Hot Tip: Togo containers are the plastic reusable kinds... WoopWoop!After my perinatal visit I decided I was really hungry. I wasn't sure what I was craving, but I knew this side of town had a vast amount of restaurants that I had been wanting to try. I consulted with Yelp and settled on Thai food. The restaurant was very spacious and clean and the host was welcoming. There was only one other table occupied as I came in at a weird "limbo" time of about 4pm. I ordered Thai coffee and Basil Noodles with seafood ($13.25) spicy level medium. I gotta say, pregnancy seems to have made me into a wuss when it comes to spicy food. Either that, or subconsciously I was not looking forward to the punishment that is severe heartburn. The portion was extremely generous, I would say enough for two people to share. I had them box up about half of it and had it for dinner little bit later. It may appear pricey to some, but it was an entree big enough to share. My total with tip was a little over $20..so not exactly cheap for one person, but as I said before, the portion and the quality justify the price. They did not skimp on the variety of seafood either. Their menu has a tapas section with many appetizing options. I am only giving them a four star because I want to try more of their menu before I decide it is emergerd the best thai food eva!There are enough items on their menu that I still want to try, so I will be back for sure.The BF regularly orders from here when he's at work. I get leftovers when he overorders- which isn't all that often, actually. The thai jerky and the crab fried rice are consistently good options, but I especially like combining the two. The dipping sauce for the jerky is awesome! They do have a $20 minimum for delivery.
Schwartz's=Woooooooooo. The fact that Schwartz's in the #1 Montréal restaurant on Yelp in horrifying. C'mon guys. You might enjoy to wait 30 minutes for the taste of delicious fat smoked meat, dry rye bread and cherry cola, but Montréal has much more to offer than Schwartz's!!! We also have poutine. Just kidding.I would be really curious to see what is the ratio tourists/Montrealers there. No offense if you'd drive 7 hours from NY to eat their smoked meat: but I would personally not go out of my way for their stack of meat, not even on a sunny day. I might get killed for saying that.For a full discussion on the topic: Is Schwartz's overrated? http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/526634After reading the reviews here on Yelp, I felt prepared for my pilgrimage to Schwartz's. I turned up around 11:30 and was amazed there wasn't a line. Inside was plenty busy, but there were a few tables still open and seating at the counter. I squeezed into a seat here, between two gentlemen, and stared in amazement at the mountains of smoked meat waiting to be sliced for sandwiches--we're talking kilos and kilos of beef encrusted in Schwartz's special spices."Parlez-vous Anglais?" I asked the gentleman on my left. "Yes," was the reply in a suspiciously American accent. I then asked if the counter guy would come back to take my order, or if there was some arcane process that wasn't obvious. He said the guy would be back to take my order and we struck up a conversation. It turns out Tim was originally from Dallas, but had been living in Montreal for about 17 years. He was already halfway through his lunch of a medium-fat smoked meat sandwich and fries. He recommended I also order the medium-fat, as the lean is too dry and some don't like the full-fat version. I followed Tim's suggestion and ordered a med-fat.When it arrived, the sandwich was a little smaller than I'd anticipated. But then I had to remind myself I wasn't in the good ol' mega-sized U.S. of A. anymore--and it was too big for me to finish anyway. The smoked meat was piled thick between two slices of a white-type bread (not sourdough, and not rye) and garnished with a bit of plain yellow mustard. The meat tasted like corned beef but not as salty, and there was just a hint of smoke to it. Tim said that he's not really sure why it's called smoked meat, because it's primarily steamed. Regardless, it was good, but I think I would have preferred the full-fat cuts. I noticed that by the time I was nearing the end of my meal, the meat had cooled and had definitely become a bit dry.So, I'm glad I made it to this shrine to smoked meats, but I think once was enough to satisfy my curiosity. And my arteries thank me.I think I am banned from here.  Read on to find out why you should not be forced into the same situation yourself...I guess first off, I should mention that their food is really as good as other reviews claim it to be.  The meat literally melts in your mouth, fries are as good as they get and the pickle is what you would imagine the perfect pickle to be. All was good in da hood.  Service was initially very good.  But it all went downhill when my friend finished his can of Coke.  We waited until our waiter came around, then he asked "Sir, could I have another can of Coke please?"  The waiter replied no problem, right away... then 5 minutes goes by.  Then 10.  Then 15.  20 minutes, and the dude does not come back with my buddy's Coke.  We were pretty sure he forgot by then, so when he came around again, my friend asked him for the Coke again (not rudely, but very politely as before).Things started to go really sour from there... the guy started giving us the kind of screw face that only the old Eastern European dudes permanently carry around.  Then he muttered something in French, which we could kind of tell was an insult because the locals surrounding us started snickering.Another 5 minuets passes by until the Coke finally arrives... slammed on top of the table.  WTF?  Why so much attitude buddy?So by this time, we are pretty much done our meal.. we grab the can of Coke to go, and ask for the cheque.  Even though we waited 20 minutes for Coke, we receive this promptly.  The awesome part?  He followed by two finger taps on the table, with instructions to "leave the tip here."Hahahaha!!  I could not believe this guy!  I've seen some guys with big balls, but this guy has the biggest balls of all time!  You want me to leave you tip?  I have never in my life had anyone ask for tip before.. never mind by someone who gave us kiss my ass service.  So after having a chuckle at his face, I grabbed the cheque and paid the cashier.Then we hit the sidewalks and started walking to our cars... out of no where, we start hearing some angry French speaking dude yelling at us.  We turned around, and sure it enough it is Mr. Big Balls himself.  When he had caught up with us, he had a copy of the cheque in his hand, and was doing math to figure out how much we should tip him.My friend and look at each other and started bursting out laughing.  We turned around and kept on walking, while LOLing non-stop... and of course, we heard lots of follow up French cursing from the angry man.Hey if the owners are reading this... control your people.  Your establishment is legendary, no argument there.  But your staff have that soup Nazi attitude because of your popularity.  And how ironic is that?Schwartz's Deli is a surprising Montreal institution, as the only thing that's obviously Canadian is their location at the heart of Saint-Laurent. Stepping inside here is like stepping into a timewarp: memorabilia cover the walls, vintage stools stand polished, and piles of meat stare right back at you, as if they're preparing you psychologically for what's to come. Yes, this is a tourist attraction, but it's a delicious one. The queue moves fast thanks to their cash-only communal seating friendly but no-nonsense customer service strategies.Try their signature smoked meat sandwich (medium cut) and throw in a huge ass dill pickle (hello ladies). The whole shebang is only about C$7! Their meat isn't the most moist - this isn't life-changing stuff - but you'll be in and out of there so fast you won't care.The smoked meat is better than Katz's! I didn't think it was possible. Ordered "fatty," you will never get closer to heaven. It's so soft and salty, and the bread is nice and soft too. For $6.15... wait, 6 bucks??? NY is a killer on the wallet, it's bullshit that I am even GLAD to pay 15 for a pastrami at Katz's.  Now I have some perspective and want to move to Montreal. From across the street, I looked at the line out the door, and didn't want to go - no matter how good it is, I'm not going to wait in line like a bunch of lemmings for a sandwich. THEN, I found that there is a take-out shop next door selling the exact same sandwich - and there's even tables and counters to sit at!  Zero line. How come no one told me about this before???I have no idea what the classic Schwartz's deli looks like, and I don't care. Schwartz's take-out window gets 5 stars - easily. It blows up the scale.We have had lunch at Schwartz's every time we come to Montréal.  There's always a bit of a wait, but people are friendly and we're generally seated pretty fast.  There are a series of communal tables of 8.  It's not a place where you linger over your meal.  People order, eat and go.  We shared our table today w/ a couple of guys from Vancouver, a professional soccer coach and the team trainer/doctor.  They were nice guys.  Another couple at the other end of the table ate quickly enough that we didn't even find out where they were from.We each ordered a smoked meat sandwich, Schwartz's specialty.  You have a choice of lean, medium or fat.  We chose medium.  Lean is reportedly too dry.  We overheard our server explain to someone that today's fat used to be medium 15 years ago, but cattle are being bred leaner these days, so they're unable to obtain the level of fat they used to.  We also ordered fries to share.  The fries came first.  There were fewer of them than at Steak Frites and they were much, much better.  The sandwiches were excellent, w/ rye bread that was on the small side and the smoked meat piled high.  It was a manageable portion and oh so tasty.There are two bathrooms for the entire restaurant, one for men and one for women.  They are basic and clean.  You pay up front at the cashier.  Alan was out of Canadian money and only had a $20.  He paid for our lunch and got change but was unable to fight his way back through the crowd, which had grown pretty thick, to tip the server.  We felt bad about that, because he'd been friendly, patient and helpful.  It was difficult even to get out the door.  It's a popular place.We all need a slump buster every so often and something to break one out of a rut. For me, there are not many things that get me more excited than talking about meat. To end my dry spell, I could think of no place better to write about than Schwartz's.On a recent trip to Montreal this spring, Schwartz's was the place that I made sure to stop by.  Founded in 1928, Schwartz's is a Montreal institution and is best known for their beloved smoked meat or viande fumee as the locals call it.  Whatever you call it, smoked meat is just plain delicious.  Unlike pastrami which has a distinct sweeter taste, smoked meat is brisket cured heavily with spices such as cracked peppercorns and coriander.  For me fat equals flavor, so I selected my smoked meat served medium which was the perfect combination of lean & fat cut from the middle of the brisket.  Served between 2 slices of rye bread slathered with mustard, this was the perfect late breakfast on a cold Montreal morning.  If you plan to visit Schwartz's, keep in mind that this is a small place & does get very crowded with both locals and tourists alike. Unless you plan on taking a taxi here, Schwartz's is also about a 5-10 minute walk from the Sherbrooke Metro station.  Another interesting fact about Schwartz's is that they were recently purchased by a group that includes singer Celine Dion.  Being an old school eatery, I really do hope that they do not change anything as this is truly part of the Montreal experience and was one of the culinary highlights of my trip.I found this place hearing it's the best place to get smoked meat in montreal. and it IS!! Came around 8pm on a monday and there was a very long line up, so we came back the next day on Canada's day around 12 and there was no line up- amazing! Inside is packed with people, and it smells great. Looks like a diner, the walls are filled with newspapers and articles about their great reputation. The blue jays have even signed for them.Had the classic medium smoked meat burger. Best meat sandwich I ever had in my life. Thick meat smothered in mustard on rye bread, the meat is to dye for. There's a lot of it though, but the best part is the crust. The meat is extremely flavourful, juicy, and tender. You see why they're in business for so long. Waiter recommended medium, but I think next time I would order lean instead, there was a lot of fat in the medium one. It's weird because my friend also got medium but was leaner than my cut.They are quick to serve and they want you out of there because they gave us the bill when I wasn't done eating. Great guys though, and I would come back again if I have the chance!I'm not a big fan of smoked meat, but everyone who has come here with me has LOVED the smoked meat sandwiches. IF you don't want to wait in line and don't mind taking to go - just walk go their takeout area (store on the left).Recommendation: 110%.Schwartz's is the gold standard for being the best at what you do.  They haven't changed a thing in decades, because it's perfect.While they have a menu, you just go for the smoked meat.  I like to get the platter of medium (fattiness that is), a stack of rye slices, some mustard, and just devour one sandwich after the next.  Along the way, have some fries with vinegar and pickles, and then wash it down with a black cherry soda.You may have to wait a little while in line and eat with other people at your table, but it's all part of sharing the experience.Pour un smoke-meat aficionados tel que moi, impossible de ne pas écrire quelques lignes à propos de Schwartz's. Donc... c'est sans trop d'enthousiasme que j'accorde 3 étoiles à cette " institution " montréalaise. Une note correcte, sans plus. Voici pourquoi :Oui, la viande ici est bonne, mais ce n'est pas la meilleure que j'ai goutée. La viande maigre (il faut dire " lean " car certains serveurs anglophones feront semblant de ne pas vous comprendre) est trop sec, il faut donc commander la régulière pour vraiment gouter un bon sandwich. Pour le reste, Schwartz's est un petit resto à l'ambiance médiocre. À l'intérieur, tout dégage une odeur de gras et de friture. Les tables sont minuscules, les chaises inconfortables, le service est " garoché ", l'ambiance est bruyante sans être vivante ou sympathique. On vous incite à manger vite et à déguerpir dès la facture arrivée à table. Ce que je trouve dommage, c'est de voir à chaque été cette longue file de touristes, un petit guide de Montréal à la main, attendant patiemment d'avoir une table. Triste oui, car malheureusement pour nous les montréalais, les guides tels que Lonely Planet (ou autres) imposent Schwartz's comme la porte d'entrée " culinaire " de Montréal, alors que bien d'autres restos méritent l'attention des touristes, qu'ils servent du smoke-meat ou non.Je le dirais toujours à nos amis touristes : vous désirez manger un bon sandwich smoke-meat et vivre une vraie belle expérience de resto de quartier à la montréalaise ? Alors quitter cette longue file d'attente et rendez-vous chez Lester sur la rue Bernard. La viande est aussi bonne sinon meilleure et l'ambiance est franchement plus authentique. Vous avez une voiture et vous êtes prêts à sortir de Montréal ? Alors prenez l'autoroute 720 direct Ouest et roulez jusqu'à île Perrot (30 minutes sans embouteillage).  Une fois passé le pont de l'autoroute du souvenir après Ste-Anne de Bellevue, vous verrez un resto au toit rouge nommé Smoke-Meat Pete. Un autre endroit que je conseil fortement.
Best of Italy - Pizza & Subs=Review NoirIt was one of those nights when every drinking party ends in a fight.  A desert wind was blowing through the streets that night.  It was a hot wind that pulled insistently at your clothes and made the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  The streets were quieter than a dead cat under the guardrail aside a moonlit mountain road.I was wearing my olive drab shorts and a black "Kill Your Television" t-shirt, I was sober and I didn't care who knew it.  I was everything an after-work regional manager ought to be and I was calling on Best of Italy.  She was exacting, charming and ruthless in the size of her slices.  I was feeling like a kid that likes to pull the legs off of spiders.  No more sense of morals than a downtrodden puppy.She's a grifter, a voice barked from the back of my mind.  Maybe she is, I thought, but what does this five-dollar special want?  Behind the flash, behind the smile, was there nothing but poison under that sauce?  I had to know, even if it meant the big sleep by morning.I tried her slices and they were good.  No, they were more than good and held that inner truth.  You know the truth I'm talkin' about.  The truth that makes you aware of just how aware you are. You know the world belongs to men like you, men who act as if it's a right to great pizza.  Pizza like this.  The truth that tells you the world would be a better place and not too dull to live in if there were more pizza like this around.  Because you're a part of it now, see?  The crust and the sauce and the cheese and the toppings...they're in you now and you can't go back.Apparently there is a burly sasquatch with a gun in the back that forces the owner to stay open past 2am on saturdays, even though the hours are only til 2.  I know this because I was there and that was one cranky owner.If you would like miserable crankiness and horrifyingly bad service, I invite you to go to this place anytime and chat up the charming owner. To their credit, the employees are not the owner. If they were, I would want to punch them too. Pizza: decent. Actually pretty good. Not good enough to weather the one-man storm of discontent. Don't go there.If you want to be yelled at for trying to get a bite to eat late night, come on over to "Best of Italy" where the motto is "Treat the customers like shit and make them suffer for all of our bad life choices"I understand that we popped into your pizza shop (located at the mecca of late night drinking - S Scottsdale) later than you wanted to be there, but you kept the door open, the open sign on and agreed to serve us and the other people in there pizza, so I don't want to hear how you have "been here since 9am."I literally got yelled at by the owner for trying to spend my money at this place, and the $3 I paid for the cold, lifeless pizza was $3 too much because it was awful, had obviously just been hanging around for hours and literally made me feel like I was digesting razor blades.Do yourself a favor and hit up Denny's or Philladelphia Sandwich Company instead... they may not serve pizza but I'm certain that they appreciate your business and won't treat you like crap.
Julio's Too=Flying makes me hungry. Actually life makes me hungry, but flying makes me extra hungry.  It's hard work sitting on that plane for 4 hours! So as soon as I landed in Phoenix last night I was ready for some grub. Gabi K picked me up from the airport and took me straight to Julio's Too to meet some of her friends for dinner. When we arrived there was a basket of chips and lots of salsa waiting for us...thanks Julio!  As I filled up on chips I checked out the menu and was torn between the shrimp fajitas and fish tacos.  I decided on the shrimp tacos (as did Gabi) and soon we were greeted with LOTS of food. We probably should have shared, but like I said before...flying makes me hungry.  I've had better fajitas in my life, but they were tasty and VERY filling.Of course I managed to eat much more than one of Gabi's friends who's 4 months pregno, but I'll blame my piggyness on the flying.If you're looking for a great mexican restaurant, then there are other places to go than this one. But if its for something to fill a hungry stomach or just wants to eat in a simple place, then this is the right spot. Food is good and quite affordable too. You can't go wrong with this one. But like I said, if its something great that you are looking for, then you're better off going to some place much better (or expensive) than this.
The Paiza Club=This is an exclusive club where high rollers, primarily aimed at the Chinese clientele, can eat, drink, and gamble.  It is the secret dining/gambling club in Vegas.  You can only get in with large deposit and/or a word from your handler/host with a reservation.  You can only get up there with a special elevator card key as well.  Once you arrive, there's special doors without signs or any indication of the place.  When you finally walk in there's a simple counter with a host waiting to accept your reservations.Once inside, this plush but not overly fancy area features a lounge area, a gambling area, and a few private rooms for dining.  I was told that the dining and kitchen is open 24 hours a day.  You can order anything from the menu at all hours.  The menu is primarily Cantonese cuisine.  The food was some of the best Cantonese Chinese I had ever had.  On top of that, there is a great liquor selection, at no charge - including some fine single malt scotches.  I was told that the Macau equivalent - Paiza Club is 4 or 5 times larger than the Las Vegas one.  I assume that there are more high rollers out there.  I was fortunate enough to have dinner at The Paiza with some friends.The Paiza club in the Palazzo on the 50th floor is as good as it gets. We had a private room for dining and had the option of ordering anything, as long as it was Asian food, on and off the menu. I wanted some eggs and they provided it, done with a 5 star flare. I asked for Vietnamese Pho and they provided that as well, which amazed the hell outta me because I thought Pho stew had to be made 12 hours in advance. We asked for Johnny Walker Blue Label and it was brought to our table. As a matter of fact, we asked for bottles of the stuff and they gladly obliged, leaving it there and asking if they should pour it or if we will. The orange juice was fresh squeezed as it was ordered. Luckily for them, I didn't want apple or watermelon juice. I would quote some prices but I can't remember any. I just recall the Blue Label in the price range of $450-550. Some of the entrees were up in the hundreds. Pros: Everything. The service. The food. The shark fin soup that I thought was noodles. Cons: None. But if we had to pay for it then the con would be the price. Other thoughts: I will be rich one day just so I can enjoy this type of lavish living all the time. But then again, I'd probably die early if I lived like this all the time. Too rich for my blood. Pun intended.
Dukes Sports Bar & Grill=Free car service to get you there and home safe??? Hell yea!Dukes is a divey, large sports bar with a million TVs, decent food, and cheap ass drinks.Specials every night ($2 burgers on Mondays), Karaoke on Wednesday and Saturday... Pool tables, shuffleboard, a misted patio for smokers, etc...Located close to old town - so this is a great place to get your party started!This is a found treasure :)
The Hero Factory=I think I'm going to cry. After over TEN YEARS of suffering through Arizona style sandwiches... Long Island is finally in the house! The first thing I saw when I walked in was the potato salad... and I knew I was home. Long Island delis have a certain way of making potato salad that I've never found anywhere else in the world. So when I saw The Hero Factory's deli case my heart started to race a little. I prayed to God that his would be the real deal. By the power of Huntington please be an authentic LI deli run by real New Yorkers.And it is!!!Ever since I moved here from New York I've been craving a real deli sandwich. That means tons of boarshead meat on a real roll (kaiser or hero) with dressing and shredded lettuce. Chicken parm, turkey and cheese, roast beef with mustard - it doesn't matter just make it taste like home. Thankfully everything I ate at The Hero Factory tasted exactly like home. Even if you are not from NY, you must give this place a try. They make the best heros in the Valley - hands down. You will fall in love.The owners did a really great job of maintaining authenticity. Their accents, personality and friendly, familiar way of talking to the customers is refreshing and so very NY. I actually feel like something good happened to me today because I discovered this place. I'll be back whenever I have a craving for good food or for home.In short, this tiny downtown sub shop serves affordable breakfast and big hero sandwiches. No vegan options though, but they have vegetarian breakfast items.I've only eaten here in the morning and usually order the garden platter which came with potatoes and coffee for under $6.I wish they'd serve tofu scrambles, but they are not that kind of restaurant.The place is clean and breakfast items are inexpensive and decent. I can't really comment about the other items though. Overall rating + 3.5I've heard about the Hero Factory for years but never had the chance to try their sandwiches until today. While waiting in the 4 hour line to redeem our Jimmy Fallon tickets, our friends were kind enough to give my pregnant self a break and let me grab a sandwich while they held our spot in line. The Hero Factory truly lived up to their name because their sandwiches were incredible and they were the closely spot open to the Orpheum. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and my husband had the Eddie Machete. Both sandwiches were amazing but I especially loved my husband's which had chicken, bacon, cheese and this amazing chipotle mayo. I wish I lived closer to the Hero Factory so I could enjoy their sandwiches more. The guys working there were super nice and friendly. If you're in Downtown Phoenix, stop by for a sandwich and you won't be disappointed!!
Thai House=Damn... Helen Y beat me to the punch and got the FTR for this place!  Oh well, I will say that she did a great job with her review - I think I was Thai in a past life; I swear, I could eat Thai food every night and be happy.  I was having a usual Thai food craving, so I popped into Thai House this evening and ordered the spicy eggplant dish (add extra veggies and tofu) - medium spice + brown rice to go.  (Yes, they have brown rice!)  I was totally blown away by how great  my dinner was!The sauce was just spicy enough, the tofu firm, and the veggies flavorful.  I was impressed that the order was filled with big chunks of luscious eggplant (I really love eggplant), but since I had them add extra veggies, it came with spinach, mushrooms, cabbage, broccoli, carrots, onions, and peppers too.  My total was $11.82, and I had the best dinner I've had in a long while.  I probably could've had enough leftover for lunch tomorrow, but it was so good, i ate it all!I can't wait to go back to Thai House to try some of the other menu items soon!  If you're looking for good Thai food in Scottsdale, give Thai House a shot!This restaurant has been open for about 7 months in my old 'hood in Scottsdale in the Sonora shopping mall off the 101 and FLW between the Best Buy and Staples. The restuarant has a sister location in Mesa.The owners are Thai. The decor is clean, neat, almost quaint, and without a lot of Thai decorative influences. They do play a sort of Ttradional Thai melodies meets New Age Relaxation type CD, and it is relaxing. I came for lunch. They run 10 lunch specials for $6.95, which includes a side salad of romaine and carrot strips with a light soy/sesame dressing. To satisfy the mostly Caucasian Scottsdale neighborhood, the choices are part Chinese (Orange Chicken, Kung Pao), Japanese (Chicken Teriyaki) and Thai (Pad Thai, Panang).I had Panang Chicken curry, which came with your choice of fried or steamed rice (steamed Jasmine). The curry comes in your preferred spice level from 1 to 5. Pick 3, which is about right for most. The curry had a nice flavor, with nice small pieces of chicken with juliened red bell peppers. I added a Thai iced tea to drink for $2. They have the usual colors of curries, all about $10, soups like Tom Yum Koong, Salads like Yum Woon Sen, Larb, and Papaya, and noodles like Pad Thai, Pad Se Ew, and Rad Nar. A bit Americanized, but tasty and very reasonable. There are few choices for Thai in Scottsdale, so if you have craving, try this one.7/26/12If you're looking for atmosphere, you won't find it here.  It's also very loud (I went during lunch hours), and you're most likely going to have to wait, unless you come during the tail-end of lunch.  (There's a sign posted on the wall by the door that stated to the effect that for those customers who did not want to or could not wait, then please visit Narai Thai and Sushi down a few doors.  To some people, it might come off as abrupt, and even slightly rude, but I thought that was generous of Thai House to post...  Both places are good, and Narai Thai has atmosphere.)   What you will find are a great Chicken panang http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JdtJ3jmMukLXU-gDjVTEgg?select=UMYl4OVwixbiNkHhZM1P2Q#x0sI8WU7hgYveO5nGEFk1A and a terrific bowl of Curry noodles!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JdtJ3jmMukLXU-gDjVTEgg?select=UMYl4OVwixbiNkHhZM1P2Q#RDHeNq9Ld9h5-6imL9WDRg  The curries here are rich and very silky-- just how I prefer them!  The Thai iced tea I had was also very, very good (not too sweet).  What I didn't like was that the lunch specials only featured the entree and your choice of soup/salad and steamed white/fried rice.  No egg roll.  Probably a healthier option, but still... :(  I didn't care for the salad dressing, a sweet vinaigrette.  Next time, I'm going to specify dry.  What really sealed the deal here for me was the service!  I cannot wait to go back and try the other menu items!Finally a good Thai joint.  The place is super casual but the dishes are tasty.  Try their signature spicy red curry catfish entree.  Everything else is quite good so come and get your Thai food here.  They have decent portions and prices but I noticed they don't offer much pork options.
Zine Noodles Dim Sum=Wow, I can't believe how bad the food was here. Tried to come here late night at 2:45 am, but they turned us away cuz they closed at 3 am.Fine. So, we went back a day later to nurse out bangin hangovers. I was so excited to try this place, but what a mother effin letdown.*shakes head*Ordered the steamed pork dumplings (xiao long bao), steamed shrimp dumplings, noodle soup with pork and pickled veggies (Taiwanese staple), and filet mignon pho tai.Har gow- eh, it was decent. 4 pieces. typical dim sum fare.Steamed pork dumplings- omg, what a disgrace to even call this that name. I had 1 piece and was thoroughly offended. He had a piece and made the funniest this-is-gross face. We left the last piece untouched. My noodle soup with pork and picked veggies was so bland and tasteless that I just couldnt eat it after a few bites. Instead I ordered beef noodle soup. Beef noodle soup came to the table 5 min later. Holy shit. It was freakin spicy as hell! I thought I was gonna die. They had added 10 red peppers in there. Not kidding. My mouth, throat, tummy, and ass was on fire. I'm really ticked off that they didn't indicate the spicy factor on the menu. It took me at least 30 min or more to get through half the dish.My DC had the pho tai and said it was awesome. I only had some broth, so I can't comment on it. Anyways, this place is not recommended. The bill was about $81, which included a thai iced tea, vietnamese iced coffee and hot tea. Hells no. Never again.3.5 stars for me.I agree with what many say that the place is overpriced, but we clearly had a better lunch than many.  Don't know if they're inconsistent, or if we just ordered better?  Here's what we had:-Shanghainese Pork Dumpling: A pretty basic dish that is hard to do badly.  The dumplings did take a while to come out (we were told this in advance), suggesting that they are fresh.  They were freshly steamed and pretty good.-Cantonese Roast Duck: This dish was small but very tasty.  The duck was nicely cooked, and the skin was flavorful and crispy.  Enjoyed this.-Satay Ox Tail Noodle Soup: Our waitress was very pleased that we both knew what ox tail was and that we liked it.  Apparently most of the whiteys that go there don't.  Living in LA, we eat everything!  This was super interesting.  Viet-style  Pho, with Thai-style satay base, with Chinese-style ox tail.  It says it's spicy and I'm sure it is for some.  I wanted it hotter, so we doctored it with some of the sauces on the table.  I enjoyed this dish a lot.  Great mix of flavors!-Singapore Style Curry Rice Vermicelli: Again, good flavors and interesting mix.  We enjoyed this too!Overall we enjoyed our meal but, admittedly, it was expensive.  I was also mildly annoyed that I needed to leave the restaurant to use the restroom; for this price, but a restroom in your place like all the other medium-upscale places!  Service was good and we were stuffed full of bold flavors.Since I come here fairly often, I figured a running list of dishes would be the most help I can give. This place is consistent with food, but I understand the price has really scared off people. That's the thing with Chinese food is that often times even if it's cooked well done, we have a mentality it is "cheap food" and again, this is a expensive casino and is a nice dining place and it's not like their prices aren't posted on online menus. Some dishes are not worth getting at the price they need to charge to be inside a expensive casino property but some are fantastic. If the basics or Americanized favorites are what you want or you are rather frugal of a traveler then do yourself a favor and go up Spring Mtn for half the price. Otherwise, if you like a nice ambiance and nice quality over thrift then read on. I guess this review is gonna be the most useful for tourists than locals. Granted I get special hookups of sorts now which makes it more affordable for me but even so I would pay for my favorite sea bass fish dish at full price. One way to get savings is they actually have a Happy Hour! It's half off all the appetizers (you can see menu online)  and beers! It's 3pm-6pm Mon-Fri, and 10pm-1am Sun- Thurs. They also do lunch specials Mon-Fri until 3pm for $15 which is a soup, entree, and mochi ice cream. Best dish - baked Chilean Sea Bass. It's a rather good portion for the $32 that is shareable, 2-3 filets of fish. It's baked in a sweetish glaze and on a bed of zucchini, tofu, whole roasted garlic, mushrooms in a light sweet and tangy sauce. Its one of my favorite fish dishes ever.Best surprise- the pho. It actually is some of the best pho I've had as the ingredients are top notch fresh but the broth balance is lovely. It is double the price, but if you're going to pick having pho here or at that place in TI and don't want to go up to Spring Mtn to get off strip prices, just come here instead as this one is rather good. Other stuff I've tried: Crispy pan fried noodles - Had it with various toppings but my favorite was the seafood one. Really good, fresh and plentiful with seafood. Other meats are good too, but it's standard. E-fu w/ crab - one of my favorites. E-fu is a soft braised noodle and is every bit my comfort food Chinese dish. I loved e-fu as a child and still do. The crab in this is fresh and the portion is hard to finish. I order this very often.Rice vermicelli noodle with shredded duck and pickled cabbage - I like this as well, better if you ask for some hot mustard to mix into as it adds the right amount of omph to it. It is a subtle dish and normally not a fan of vermicelli (except pho) but I love the sauce that is in this and the combo of pickled cabbage in it. This is also something we order a lot. Curry Crab- really messy, but a awesome tangy and fragrant curry. It probably takes away from the dish a bit to do the curry on the side, but seriously was hard to crack shells covered in sauce no matter how delicious it was. Seared Scallop with Schzuan Pepper Sauce- the sauce is good and they do give you plentiful big scallops but they were cut in half thinner and well cooked which I don't prefer so I haven't ordered again. I may ask whole piece and not well done. Shredded Pork and Thousand Year Congee- pretty good congee. I know thats a very plain and subtle thing, but a sign is it didn't really need soy in it. It was well seasoned on its own. Yang Chow Fried Rice - it's bb pork and shrimp fried rice. Pretty good and flavorful, no need for any seasoning, except I do love hot sauce on my rice. Cha Gio- they were decent viet style egg rolls, but not my favorite. Also I was missing the plentiful herbs, It just came with lettuce and nuoc nam. Macau style pork belly- the portion isn't very huge, but it's perfectly cooked. Crispy skin, melty fat and juicy meat. Spicy Chili Wonton - nice fresh made wontons in spicy oil and sauce. Pretty good as far as dim sum go. Spring Onion Pancake- theirs is good, crisp and comes piping hot fresh. Black bean sauce pork ribs - one of my favorite dimsum and theirs here is really tender. Shrimp har gao- good, but standard. Same goes for the Shumai. Red bean pastry with vanilla ice cream - it's basically like spring onion pancakes except with red bean instead. A pretty good dessert with a bit of vanilla and chocolate sauce. Service here has never been bad, it's always in a acceptable range of good to really good depending on who we get. There's a few people we prefer having, that has been here a while and are ninja intuitive with diners needs. I'll keep adding to this list as I dine here.The Service: Okay... took the order fast. Serve the food fast. But our server never checked on us after that.... Not attentive. The Food: SUPER OVERPRICED Chinese food. Since it is at the Palazo Hotel so it is expected.Fish porridge - Lots of rice..... only a few pieces of fish for $19!!!! So not worth it. Not much flavor too. Very disappointed.
Sabor Cubano Restaurant=It's a buffet so honestly I don't think I could ever give it 5 stars.   They had a very good variety, about 6-8 entrees, about 4 sides, a small salad bar and a small desert bar. The flavors were pretty solid. The biggest problem was that most of the entree items had dried out, and it was only 12 noon.   If they had plastic covers or covered the meat items with sauces it would have been much, much better.The starter item of plantains were good, but a little sweet for me.  I didn't finish them.Not bad and I might go back but if I'm going to a buffet I'd rather stick to my Indian buffets.I went to April Office hours at Drip on Thursday and really enjoyed getting to know some of the people that populate the Yelp community. One of the things I like about Yelp is that people actually get together to talk about food, culture, art, etc. I spend way too much of my life with my head buried in a monitor, dealing with electro-mail and what not:)So, given the crowd at Office Hours, it probably isn't incredibly surprising that after Office Hours, we decided that we had better get something to eat...I need my 7 square meals a day or I get cranky...low blood sugar:)I set out for Sabor Cubano, with Mr. K and Brian S. (as agreeable a pair of lunch companions as there are:).I had never been to Cuban Flavor, although I am big fan of Cuban food (and cuban cigars, but no,no,no,no, I don't smoke them no more...I've been following Jim W's song title thread:). I like Havana Café (a review for another day), but I had not had some of the "down home" or "en casa" Cuban food that we got at Sabor Cubano.I can take or leave buffets, as general rule (I think "sneeze guard" is just a suggestion, in the buffet line, frankly...I have seen far too many people with their head under the Plexiglas, trying to get that last pickle or radish to be comfortable that it keeps much in the way of disease out of the food:). For you non-buffet types, Sabor Cubano has table service, Cuban specials (sandwiches, beef dishes, etc.).But "danger" is my middle name and the lunch buffet was truly delightful. I got to sample so many cubano dishes that I hadn't tried before. They had navy beans and ham, with giant ham hocks sitting in the beans in the hot table...delightful:) ; they had 3 different types of chicken on the bone, all seasoned and prepared differently and all delicious. There were spicy black beans and red beans, several different kinds of rice, potatoes that really complemented one of the chicken dishes.Chicken Croquettes, Beef, fish, and vegetables and soup, all cooked in a Cuban style completed the hot offerings. Everything was well prepared, and nothing was dried out and tired (something you see in buffets on a pretty constant basis).The salad bar was clean and the vegetables fresh, and the desert bar had custard and a rice pudding that looked great and authentic (I didn't have desert...I am trying to watch my figure:)A very solid offering for under $10, including drinks. It didn't hurt that we had some great conversation and few laughs during lunch, too! Sabor Cubano stays in the rotation:)Brian and Mr. K, thanks again for pointing me south to Cuba! (or was it northwest?).
Marssa=Possibly my favorite dish ever...I would never do this dish justice by attempting to describe it but all I can say is that I've never had anything like it before and whenever friends ask me where to eat I can't help but to bring this place up just for this dish alone! You can pick any fish you'd like & it's cooked in a banana leaf with coconut milk, potatoes and bananas. The aroma alone might cause you to make a sound that isn't appropriate at any restaurant :) Amazingness doesn't begin to describe the dish. I could eat it every day, all day for the rest of my life. For this dish alone I have to give this place 5 stars. As for everything else, it's ok, nothing spectacular. The restaurant itself is very dated and desperately needs a facelift. It overlooks the lake which is probably beautiful during the day but at night you can't see any of it. All the other dishes including the sushi are overpriced & good but again nothing amazing. I drive from Summerlin for this one fish dish cooked in a banana leaf which is crazy but every bite of it is so worth it! I will be back just to order my favorite thing ever over & over again.
Asia=Listed by Get Out Mag as a hip noodle house (formally called sN Asian Kitchen), Asia is said to have a cool black/white/red decor motif with a sushi bar. The restaurant - described as cozy - features noodle dishes from Japan, China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. Also, there's live jazz music Friday and Saturday nights. So, ask yourself: Would that tempt you? It certainly did me, and at 7 p.m. on a Saturday, my sushi-lovin' friend and I met here. We were immediately shown to a corner booth and given menus. Our server was friendly, albeit a tad eccentric, which we didn't mind. Her quick, matter-of-fact manner was something we couldn't decide if we liked. But, that's okay. Our first challenge was to pick out our drinks. The wine list is HUGE. There's also specials they write on a big chalk board. Narrowing it down to a few selections took a few minutes... and my friend was disappointed to be told twice that they were out of the drink of her choice (including one of the sakes on the menu). Bummer. I went with the J Lohr Wildflower red blend. And I didn't like it. I told our server that I should have taken her suggestion and gotten the Writer's Block Zin and I was hoping I could send back the Wildflower. "You don't like it?""No, sorry. I don't.""That's okay. I hate it. It's so popular, though. I don't understand why."Uhm, good to know. For being honest about other wines, she certainly held her tongue when I placed my order. My friend and I split the Salmon Salad app, with fresh spinach and pine nuts. It was very tasty. The Salmon was tempura, but I didn't find it too fried to enjoy. We then shared the Best of Asia - 3 pieces each of yellow tail, tuna and salmon, lightly seared and flavored with garlic, paprika, ponzu and a jalapeno on top. HOT! I had two pieces and left the rest for my friend. The Big Buddha Roll, which we shared, was very, very tasty. It was a little spicy, but in that good way I enjoy. This roll was double wrapped with soy paper on the outside and had crab meat, avocado, cream cheese and salmon inside. YUM! About 3/4 of our way through dinner, the server brought out my new glass of wine. Uhm, ok. "Sorry, I totally forget.""But at least you remember," my friend remarked. As for the atmosphere, it can only be summed up this way: Airport. I got the feeling that if I walked out the front doors, I'd be inside an airport terminal, headed to whatever gate I needed to be at to make my flight. The interior of the place, like my friend pointed out, seemed to be the type of place that "you cram things inside a space that don't really fit or belong." Bingo! The sushi bar/kitchen takes up the bulk of the space, with a short sushi bar area to its immediate side. There's a few tables scattered about, as well as a few booths. The decor is red, black and white - Get Out was right about that. I just would never call this place cozy. They did turn down the lighting around 7:30 which helped immensely. As for the music, it was nice jazz. The trio set up in a corner and played a few songs. Sax, drums, guitar - what else do you need? On our way out, while the band was on break, we learned they weren't even a band... and that they just kind of set up and played in an impromptu style. Regardless, they were enjoyable. They didn't really fit the motif of the restaurant, tho. It was more of the "airport restaurant trying to be a cool lounge with live music."When the bill came, I was pleased to see our server did not charge me for the glass of wine I sent back. I appreciated that. Yet, the bill was a bit too high for the type of service/experience my friend and I had here at Asia. $46 for 2 people? Ouch. Both the Buddha Roll and Best of Asia were $12 a piece (the former totally worth it; the latter not). The appetizer salad was $8. My friend's sake was $2 (bargain) and my glass of really great Zin (a new fave) was $9. All in all, it added up. But I definitely would not go back to throw down that kind of money at a place that reminded me of an airport restaurant. Also, while we were waiting for the server to run my card, I flicked with my forefinger what I thought was a piece of paper, though in my mind it looked like a tiny, tiny fly. Turns out the "piece of paper" sprouted legs and started to crawl across the table. IT WAS A BUG! Ew. Gross. This place has potential, but it'll need a real overhaul to entice me to come back. Redeeming traits:*HUGE wine list (almost too big; it's hard to decide)*Full bar with beer selections, including a couple Asian favorites*Sake choices for cheap*Big Buddha Roll that's one of the best rolls I've had - anywhere*Live music - sure beats pop music blasting overhead*Clean bathroom with a vibrant green scheme - with several men's magazines to flip through (Weird, eh?) and a pic of Audrey Hepburn on the wall
Temple Bar Sports Grill=I had one of the best St. Patties Days of my life here. The place was completely packed and full of fun friendly folks. Do yourself a favor and try Temple real soon (I prefer Friday, Saturday or Sunday night).Two stars for Temple should be extreme flattery.I just want to remind everyone that as of Tuesday night, we are still in a recession. People are looking for work, companies are going out of business left and right, middle class families are living on the street. What does this mean, you ask?Well, it means if I come into your eating and drinking establishment with fifteen others, you should be excited that your damn bar is getting business and that you will walk out with some cash in your pocket.Is that what happened? NoWe got terrible service. Our waitress was really snappy and rude, complaining before we even sat down about splitting checks. She took a few orders first and then came back later to take the rest while informing us that they were no longer serving food. If she would have said that in the beginning, maybe everyone would have had a chance to order before the kitchen closed.The "smothered" tater tots were basically just sprinkled with cheese.  This was a huge disappointment because I love cheese.The only redeeming thing about this place was the fact that they had good reverse happy hour specials.Temple - if you want repeat customers, treat them a little better. Especially since you are in WAY northeast Scottsdale and people are not just going to accidentally run into you.I lived down the street from this place for almost two years before I even heard about it. I shouldn't have admitted that to you because now my credibility when it comes to knowing the "it" places in Scottsdale just went down the tubes. FAIL. But hey, if you are reading this review you probably haven't been there yet either so just shut up and read, ok? Here is the dilly. I came here NYE. They had a $65 all you can drink special from 9p-2a that night. Nydia A. and I waited until the last minute to make plans and this seemed easy and pretty damn affordable, not to mention close to home. As a NYE venue I wasn't a big fan...but I do know a good (or even great) sports bar when I see one. What it isn't: Hoppin with booty shakin music (we had to beg the DJ to play what we deemed "dance worthy" music), filled with beautiful people, packed to the brim with a thirty minute wait to get in, pretentious, where you should go if you are a Scottsdale DB looking to get laid. What it is: A place to get good (strong) drinks for a reasonable price, convenient if you live within a five mile radius (they have a paddywagon free of charge), chill, and very conducive to the needs of sports enthusiasts. Oh and somewhere I can go without having to primp and wear six inch ankle breaking heels. (totally wish I got that memo BEFORE I dressed for NYE) The bottom line: You'll probably see me there during football season proudly sporting a Tebow jersey, yelling at the flat screens, beer in one hand and hot wing in the other.This is my kind of sport's bar! Good food, good atmosphere, good pricing and plenty of TVs for the sport's fan. There is plenty of seating both inside and outside and it appeared to be much smaller on the outside then it actually is on the inside. During a recent visit, we started with the hangover hummus which is spicy hummus and then I had the Sonoran burger with avocado. I would say that the food is a couple steps above normal bar food and this is very similar to a Zipps. It's the perfect spot to bring a group and have a casual but entertaining night out. It's also the perfect place to watch a game if you're near the McDowell Mountain Ranch area.
Chick-fil-A=Chick-fil-a is comfort fast food for me. I love the original chicken sandwich; I add 1 pack of honey mustard. I grab a second honey mustard packet for dipping my delicious waffle fries - which, unfortunately, they sometimes skimp on, in my opinion. I have to tell you, though, I witnessed the talent of the best balloon artist I've ever seen at this location! (He's not there every week, but you'll find him there on some Wednesday afternoons for the whole "kids eat free" thing.) I was so mesmerized, as I waited in line to order and then for my food,  that I hardly noticed the wait and the fact that the place was overrun with little ones didn't detract from my experience! Chick-fil-a actually caters to the whole family thing really well. (And, their kids' meals have educational toys, often promoting literacy).
Sugarbakers Cafe & Bakery=A nice little find tucked away in the overly pretentious Borgata shops, Sugarbakers is a new entry (only opened last month, I believe) into the competitive lunch market.  However, like Transformers, it's more than meets the eye.  In addition to traditional lunch fare (sandwiches & salads), they also serve breakfast and have a full working bakery that churns out cookies, brownies, pies & made to order cakes.At first I kinda thought this place was typically, Scottsdalianly overpriced.  However, look who they're competing against for your lunch dollar.  For $9 at Sugarbakers, you get a half-sandwich with REAL carved turkey they roasted that day, a bowl of homemade soup, a mound of kettle chips, a homemade mini-muffin, a couple pieces of carrot, a slice of pickle and an olive.  (I was a little like, "uhhhhh, why do I have an olive?" at first).  Compare that to $6 for Subway or $8 for something like Paradise Bakery.  The freshness and quality here are so far superior that you'd be a dumbass not to pick Sugarbakers.Also, I had a bit of an "OHMYGOD" moment.  I'm not sure if it's because I'd pretty much cut sweets out of my diet for the last month or so or what, but their chocolate chip cookie is effing ridiculously good.   They also had something called a "Cowboy Cookie" that had pecans & rice krispies in it.   It was novel, but not holycrapworthy like the chocolate chip.  Most of their lunch items are in the $7-11 range.  Next time I go, I have my eye on the "Sedona Special Salad", which has greens, turkey, cranberries & pecans.with a citrus vinaigrette or the "Sugarbakers Chopped Salad" that has greens, avocado, blueberries & walnuts.  Their breakfast stuff seems pretty fairly priced- Stack of pancakes for $5, Apple Praline or Bananas Foster French Toast (whoa, sounds good) for $8, Bacon & Eggs for $7.   I'll have to check it out and throw on a homemade cinnamon roll just for good measure.Also, like I mentioned, you can get cakes & pies to order.  When I was there, one lady was picking up 30 cakes for an event.  Sugarbakers also makes mention that they use organic & natural foods whenever possible.  The quality shows.
Cabo Mexican Restaurant=SPECIAL 3 item combos $8.99 + $3 Margaritas!! plus Chips & salsa plus bean dip for FREE-At all @stationcasinosWe visited Palace Station around 10pm Friday Evening and there was no wait to be seated during the #UNLVmbb game. Service was fast & friendly bringing drinks & chips/salsa out almost immediately. I ordered my regular the carne asada fajitas and the wife got a 3 item combo of beef enchilada,beef taco and something mexican.As you can see from whats pictured NOT what you think when you think fajitas, right? I'm thinking slightly sauteed peppers & onions , medium rare finely sliced carne asada with tortillas, pico and sour cream,guac on the side maybe even some cilantro and HOT sauce.Really cheap and cheesy. meat was tough and NOT marinated like you'd expect. Didn't even touch the rice & beans just didn't pass the look test. sidenote:  The sides pico/sour cream/guac were in the same small bowl and watered together-not very cool either.How this place has failed to find someone to cook good mexican food in Las #Vegas boggles the mind.After the last 2 visits, I feel differently about this Cabo location. Not all of the Cabo's are consistent and now this one isn't either. Major bummer! There was no line when hubby and I arrived, but we still stood there waiting for about 10 minutes before someone noticed us. I would have wondered if they were even open, but I called prior to see if they had a wait and any specials going and the girl who answered the phone said to come on down. Then once we were seated it took another 10 minutes to have chips, salsa, bean dip and drinks brought to out table. It would have been nice if we were acknowledged sooner.We ordered "Chili Con Queso" priced at $5.99 to start. This is the one thing here that is still consistently good. It has a blend of cheeses with onions, tomatoes, serrano chilies and comes with tortilla chips. For the price it is a great deal and goes a long way. I had the AYCE "Crispy Tacos" for my meal priced at $8.99 that included beans and rice. The beans were cracked on top and hard. The rice was so dry and flavorless. My tacos (chicken and ground beef) had a terrible flavor and the bottoms of the taco shells were so greasy and soggy that when I picked up my first taco the bottom fell out. I would have asked for new tacos, but the place was packed and I only saw 2 servers and one person clearing tables, so flagging someone down wasn't easy. I had honesty gotten my fill with the chips, salsa, bean dip (it wasn't cracked and hard like the beans on my plate) and chili con queso anyway and didn't want to wait any longer than we had been waiting during our experience already.Our server was nice (what I saw of him) and I could tell he was really trying, but with very little staff on hand he could only do so much. Maybe if they had the proper amount of help they could have put out better dishes like I have had in the past and service would have been more timely and just all around better.
Pitta Souvli=I have really been craving Greek food and I was in the area so I thought I'd give this new place a try.I decided on getting their variety platter which consisted of Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Dolmades, Spanakopita and Falafel served with pita bread.(see pics)Oh how disappointing!*Strike 1~The baba ganoush was over pureed into a thin slimy goo, it didn't taste very good either. All the baba ganoush I have ever eaten has been thick and had some texture left to it with a very distinct flavoring. This was the worst I've ever had.*Strike 2~The Hummus was gritty and bland. I was really looking forward to the strong garlicky lemon taste, none of that here though. Again another worst ever.*Strike 3~The Dolmades(grape leaves) smothered in a thick tomato and lemon slime, had the mushiest, yet sticky and pasty rice inside, it was awful.I grew up on these and actually make them quite often(grandmas secret recipe), so I think I know what I'm talking about.  I've had bad grape leaves but these take the cake.*Your OUT!~The Falafel, well you can see from the picture they look more like cookies, but nowhere near as good. They were more like fried wet sand , dry with no flavor at all. I wouldn't feed these to my dog.The Spanakopita might have been the most edible part of this platter but by then it was too late, They had already been way past striking out in my book.I tell the waitress and she sends over the manager, to whom I explained why I was unhappy with my meal.She apologizes but the has the nerve to ask me:"WELL, ARE YOU GREEK?!!!"As a matter of fact YES I AM, I should be asking her that!I know good Greek when I eat it and especially when I make it myself with recipes taught to me by own Grandmother, and sorry honey but that wasn't it!I gave 2 stars only because she took it off my bill. OPA!
Firehouse Subs=Came here for a sub and left with a big ole smile on my face!  Firehouse subs totally hit the spot.  They serve hot subs, and was amazed at how good they tasted.  I had the #3 which was roast beef and pastrami with all the fixings.They do have a great selection of hot sauces here, but I didn't try any of them.  The subs here come in 2 sizes, 8 inch and 12 inch.  Prices are actually quite reasonable, and I feel like I got a lot more then I paid for.  Tasty bread, a filling meal, and enough sub to make me happy.  They even sell their pickle buckets here.  Their those big drum looking things that are probably hold at least 5 gallons of goods for $2.  I guess the $2 goes towards a fireman's charity or something, but either way, its for a good cause.  Anyways, this place is worth checking out.  :-)
Pizzeria=MMMMM... I just had another mouth orgasm today... We ate at the Pizzeria Circus Circus for dinner and they did not disappoint! Simple, 16' pepperoni fresh baked and piping hot! Plenty of cheese and topping. The crust was light and flaky. Delicious! Will definitely do a repeat the next time we stop by Circus Circus. All you can drink fountain soda and iced tea. Love that!
Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House=Hold up, hold your horses, not another Del Friscos review! This one isn't all rainbows and smiley faces though. Well, all things considered, they're still receiving 4 stars and I can honestly say at the end of the day, the Del doesn't disappoint. The stage is set once you browse the menu. It describes how to eat the bread, 'with your hands' and clear as day lets you know that YOU, "you mean me?", yes YOU control the pace of the meal. Maybe that's the reason for such limited reservations spots? Most definitely not a detrimental way of doing business. Del Friscos truly is a "can't miss" for restaurant week. Their version of turtle soup was yummay. Perfectly seasoned and quite filling. The steak - even hooked on phonics couldn't educate me enough come up with adequate adjectives to describe it. Unlike Del's adopted stepbrother Sully, the steak here is seasoned just right. The potatoes were good but nothing to call home to momma about. But that strawberry cheesecake...oh man. Do you like Strawberry Shortcake ice cream? This guy right here sure does and that's what that cheesecake tasted like. Now that's how you finish off a meal. As stated, it isn't all praise and worship though. Upon our arrival, we didn't even get greeted. Wait, are we at the right place? Is this the Westin or Del Friscos? Can I get a hello, bienvenidos, aloha, anything? Nope. We had to approach the hostess and introduce ourselves and reservation. Our first cocktail waitress wasn't all that nice either. Normally I wouldn't even give a rat's arse or give it a second thought but these two were almost, almost rude - at least by Del Frisco's standards. If it was any other place, I'd pay it no mind. But it's Del and let's face it, we all expect perfection. See what you guys have done Del Friscos? You're too damn good for your own good.
PePeRo=I love that I have this Korean mart down the street from me. And here I was thinking I'd be stranded in NC without kimchi for x number of years. This little market has been a saving grace for me. I can get my jars of kimchi, packets of soontofu mix, asian vegetables, snacks, seafood, or anything else I need from this one market. The restaurant in the back is tiny, but it does the job. The soontofu and bibimbap are good enough and there are plenty of little dishes provided. The people that work here are sweet and the prices are comparable to what I usually expect from a Korean restaurant.Come here for Korean food!I was in such a long withdrawal of authentic Asian food that eating at PePeRo deserved 5 stars! I would give it 10 even for being so close to where I live!Moving from LA to Charlotte is quite an adjustment, especially when it comes to the food scene. And PePeRo is now my saving grace.I ordered the Bibimbap and cleaned every speck of the bowl, the miso soup, and ALL the sides. Mind you, I'm a little 5 feet Asian girl.In summary, it's good ol' Korean home cooking and as a bonus, there's a small grocery store attached where I can conveniently do my Asian shopping!THIS is the place to go for Korean food!! When you first get there, the enterance is to the side where you might see some shopping carts. It's a bit awkward and a little more awkward once you get in because you don't know what to do. LOL! Half of it is a shop and the other half is the restaurant. But you'll be greeted with smiling faces and they'll ask if you're dining and sit you down. Once you've got a seat, it's smooth from there on. Pricing is very good, compared to other Korean restaurants I've been to. My dish cost around $9-$11 while at other places it runs to $15.It feels like eating at home, but with someone serving, cooking, and cleaning for you. The decorations on the wall are beautiful and sometimes they have cute decorations on the table too. All the food is always served with fresh yummy sides. Our favorite sides are the bean sprouts, spinach, and the fishcake (I believe it's fish cake). I always get the same thing each time because I just love it so much: Yuk Gae Jang. You MUST try their fried rice. I don't know why it's so good! It leaves you wanting more after one bite. I love how they serve their water. It's definitely not from the sink.If it's your first time eating Korean, it's always safe to go with a Kalbi or Bulgogi dish. You can venture out when you're brave enough. And like I said in my other reviews, go with a group, so you can try their dishes lol.  My niece loves going here because they have a "bell" service where you press a button and a bell goes off in the backroom to let them know if we need anything. They come and check up on you too, so it's not like they're sitting around for the bell.(Note: This review is about the restaurant portion of the grocery store.) Pepero, thank you for being in Charlotte! Besides the items I've tried in my previous review, I've since tried their kimchi jigae and yukae jang. I would try other items on the menu, but the latter two have recently won my heart.Don't expect anything fancy, but you will be served efficiently and attentively. Pepero can get pretty busy depending on the time you come, but I really think the servers try their best to make sure you have a fine dining experience. I appreciate that.I'm fan because PePeRo it's a spot where I can get eat an authentic Korean meal and shop for Asian food! I'm not going to lie - it can be a bit intimidating, especially if you've never been. Let me lay it out for you - PePeRo is located in Matthews, near the intersection of John St/Monroe Rd and Hwy 51.  The entrance is located on the side of the building - there aren't a ton of parking spots but it's adequate.  When you enter, you'll be entering the market portion of PePeRo and off to the right of the entrance is the restaurant. The dining room is split into a couple different sections, I suspect from the effort to add on more dining tables. Usually, someone is there to greet you and show you to a table. It can get rather busy during peak dinner hours.The menu is fairly straight forward - yaki mandoo, kimchi pancakes, bulgogi, etc - and it comes with the traditional banchan (side dishes).  My faves are the yaki mandoo and the kimchi pancakes.  The bulgogi portion is generous and comes with white rice. My husband usually gets the kimchi tofu soup. I've also had the cold buckwheat noodles which is yummy on a hot day!I have to admit my favorite part about visiting PePeRo is the market - I can pick up a lot of my Asian favorites, not just Korean! I can pick up Japanese curry cubes, roasted seaweed packs, miso paste, Filipino sardines, sauces galore, as well as green tea, barley tea, and rice!   So my two cents? Don't be intimidated to visit, there's usually someone who can help you out and direct you to what you're looking for.Disclaimer: this was my first exposure to Korean food. If I could recommend some more expert reviews to read on this, i would say check out Dan C, Ellen O, Peggy C and Christi K's posts. I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now. Dan C. took myself and some friends here on Monday night. We put him in charge of recommendations and ordering. We got a round of appetizers for our group of five and all different entrees. I don't know what anything is called... so bear with me. App wise kimchi pancake, steamed bun and the wonton-potsticker like goodness. I went with the bbq pork with steamed rice. Bottom line: it was all good. The seafood noodle type soup was LOADED with seafood. And best part... it's all a ton of food. We all had leftovers for the next day. Split 5 ways we each spent only $16. What a deal.Some things to know (for those not familiar with PePeRo or Korean cuisine)-There's a bell at your table for service.-Try all the sides that come out with your food.-If you're coming from Charlotte on Monroe Rd, turn before the restaurant. I drove past it and turned into the driveway on the other side which is actually for another business.-Go explore the grocery store. -Both the store and the restaurant take credit cards. However, please note the grocery store does have a $20 minimum.-They do have plastic forks for the chopstick-challenged. And by chopstick challenged, I am talking about myself. This is the girl who eats sushi with her hands.-Don't be afraid to ask questions. Someone can point you in the right direction.I will definitely be back. I loved the vibe here. It was comforting and kind of felt like getting a homecooked meal at a relative's house.Loved it!  This place screams authentic.  Now, I don't think I am the foremost expert on Korean food and judging its authenticity but I can easily say that this was exactly what I was looking for.  A little hole in the wall Korean Grocery store with a quaint restaurant in the back.  It had one section for booths and one section for tables.  Each table had a service bell on the table when you are ready.  Otherwise, the staff will leave you the F alone (which can be nice sometimes rather than being bugged ever two seconds).  On to the food....  I ordered the Pork Bo go bi (something like that, hahaha).  It was.... BANGING!  It came over some white rice and was cooked in a full-flavored kimchi type sauce.  The spice was perfect for me (not a huge fan of really spicy) and it didn't take over the taste at all.  Just right!  Also, the sides were a perfect compliment.  They were free and they were basically little sample dishes:  seaweed salad, kimchi, sautéed veggies.  Enjoy!-Ian M.
Queen Creek Olive Mill=The Queen Creek Olive Mill is the perfect outing if you're looking for something new to do or if you're hosting out of town guests. It's located approximately 45 miles from downtown Phoenix on the edge of Queen Creek. Allow for at least 2 hours to spend at the QCOM, which can be filled with the 30-minute tour, sampling, lunch, shopping, or just hanging out with a bottle of wine at one of thee seating areas available. One inside the store/café, an umbrella covered patio, or the picnic benches shaded by the olive trees. The Café offers breakfast specials, sandwiches, paninis, soups, salads, bruschetta, gelato, and special wines. The store sells a variety of olive oils, stuffed olives, cremas, and tapenades made from olives grown/harvested from the local grove.    Recommended items.-Burnt Mozzarella Bruschetta (3); melted mozarella, roasted garlic, and a tasty oregano pesto- burnt to perfection!    -Mushroom Bruschetta (3); wild mushrooms, herbs, and caramelized onions-  A generous mix of shrooms and onions. -Mansi Panini; Tequila lime roasted chicken, fontina , sun dried tomato, parmesan tapenade and tomato parmesan crema: comes with a side of olives and chips. The tour:An educational guide on how the olives are grown, harvested, and processed. The complimentary sampling bar includes a variety of:Olive Oils: about 10 to taste from- surprising twist were the vanilla bean, blood orange, and lemon infused olive oils. Tapenades: 7 to taste from - My fav was the caramelized onion and fig Stuffed Olives: About a dozen to taste from - All were great but my top two were the Oregano feta and Vermouth garlic stuffed olives.The olives, olive oils, and tapenades sold on site are great gift ideas for folks looking for Arizona made products. Will be adding a few to my x-mas list. Our trip to the Olive Mill was very enjoyable and we'll be adding it to our must see AZ places for our visiting friends and family.Sure it is out there....way out there.  But the support and patronage of unique cultural spots requires a little bit of sacrifice.  Make a day off it.  Visit the Schnepf Farms in the morning and have a nice casual lunch at the Mills.  I guarantee it is a better Saturday then whatever is on TV.The location itself is rather lacking. If they were to develop the area and landscape more they could turn it into a real destination.  As it currently stands, it is still a great place to enjoy a splendid meal and casually talk away an hour or two.  The Del Piero is spacious and has several incredible options that will ensure multiple visits.  The Cerignola panini is substantial without weighing you down.  It has several great flavors in just the right portions so that you can enjoy each one.  They have a variety of great breakfast dishes as well.  Also, you can't leave without buying some of the product.  Who knew the Olive was this versatile. The prices are on the high side but that is to be expected for boutique items such as these.  Don't forget to get some vanilla, olive oil cupcakes.  These things make Sprinkles seem so "Betty Crocker" in comparison.Since I've always been a huge fan of Popeye and Olive Oil, it's no wonder I was drawn to this place... :)Thanks to Robert M's review, I checked out QCOM's website and ordered a holiday gift for an out-of-state friend... the process was simple as can be and I felt safe using my credit card on their secure site.  I received confirmation via email a few seconds after the transaction went through... I hope my friend enjoys her Arizona made gift and I look forward to visiting Queen Creek Olive Mill sometime in person.  I'm sure it will be a fun little field trip!Olive oil has a ubiquitous influence in the foodie world, but how much do we know about what goes into producing a fine extra virgin?The Queen Creek Olive Mill is where all of your questions will be answered.  Begin your visit with a $5 tour, which "walks" you through the growing process, and what makes Queen Creek an excellent location for Olive groves.  Why, although not organically certified, these olives are not treated with chemicals or pesticides.  Find out about the olive harvest, why there is no such thing as a black olive, and why The Mill's Master Blender carefully and meticulously supervises each harvest from begin to end.The tour takes you into the heart of the operation, the presses.  All olive oil is extracted by mechanical means, keeping its integrity.  In the pressing room, you can sample varieties of olive oils as well as olives.After experimenting for over a decade with different olives, the result is a grove of over a dozen varieties of olives.  Their extra virgin has a distinct flavor due to a few practices inherent in their harvesting.  Olives are harvested by hand (no fallen olives) and cold pressed within 24 hours.  Due to late harvests between the months of September and December, their olive oil has a fruity yet buttery taste.  And you can sample all of their infused oil at the Olive Oil bar. I highly recommend the Meyer Lemon for dipping and cooking, as well as the White Truffle oil.  For baking their Chocolate olive oil and vanilla bean are amazing, and can replace the need for regular vegetable or cooking oils.  The differences in moisture and flavor are astounding!~  There is a reason why they claim that "you are literally buying one of the best olive oils in the world."Along with a plethora of cooking oils, there are body care products made with their EVOO.  The body creams leave my skin moist and fresh for nearly a day, the lip balms are also exceptional.The cafe has a fresh assortment of sandwiches and salads.  Although the bruschettas look great, they are tiny pieces of extremely dry and crusty bread, the various toppings lacking in freshness and flavor - unfortunately.  But the most important thing to try on your sojourn here is the Olive Oil cake  You will never have cake that is more filled with flavor, more buttery, and for lack of a better word - more luscious.Wines from around the world can also be purchased by the bottle in their wine section.A fantastic place for a date, a relaxing lunch, an education...We like to support locally owned businesses, but some local establishments make it so difficult for us to do so.My wife and I went for lunch and ordered a sandwich (Lucca: Herb roasted turkey) and a bruschetta plate (Burnt Mozzarella & Pesto: Wild Mushroom: & Caramelized Red Onion & Fig Tapenade). FYI, there is no table service so you have to order at the counter.  I will say that the staff was friendly, so that's the positive, though there should have been more staff working the counter because it got backed up. The sandwich tasted OK, but the presentation was unimaginative, the bread not fresh (so dry it was falling apart) and the portions smaller than similarly priced fare fare from other establishments we frequent.  Frankly, the best thing on our sandwich plate was the potato chips!The bruschetta was laughable! For 6.99 we received 3 SMALL slices of bread that were only partially covered with a visually unappetizing mix of toppings. The bread was not adequately toasted so each piece was somewhat soggy. In addition, none of the toppings were warm, even though the cheese on two pieces was melted and the third topped with what we would describe as a chunky mushroom paste (that was claimed as served hot)... which led us to believe these items are prepared in advance and not to order, hence the cool temp and soggy bread.Seriously! $6.99 for 3 small slices? Haven't the owners ever been to Postino to see what presentation, flavor and value are all about. Check the photo link in my profile and you'll find the one I posted of QCOM's sorry excuse for a bruschetta plate. And to all of you who will argue "but the Postino Bruschetta is 13.50"! Yes, it's nearly double the price, but at Postino you receive: A) 4 LARGE pieces of bruschetta, cut into thirds for 12 slices total, each slice about the size of one QCOM bruschetta; B) Easily triple the amount of toppings on each piece: C) something flavorful that you'll actually enjoy eating; D) A beautiful presentation; E) Table service from friendly, knowledgeable staff.Don't get me wrong. I think it's great that the Rea Family has brought a fine range of olive oils and related products to Arizona and we have used their oils in our home kitchen.Unfortunately, the del Piero eatery is operated more like a tourist destination where they figure it's a "one shot" opportunity to get maximum return for minimum investment from customers who probably won't be returning. Our suggestion, take the tour, buy some olive oil... then go somewhere else for lunch where they have taken the care to give you superior ingredients, prepared with skill, in sufficient quantity to justify the price and with friendly efficient service to boot.Oh yeah... as for the Gelato. Don't bother. Go to Frost at San Tan if you want a real, authentic, phenomenal Gelato experienceThis comment for the owners: While we were waiting for our lunch we went over to the wine tasting area. The young lady hosting the tasting was very pleasant and outgoing, but when we heard her say the Pinot Gris was made from white Pinot Noir grapes we, and the other couple tasting at the time, realized we wouldn't get an education with our tasting. To QCOM and all other establishments doing tastings... please, please, please don't have a wine novice doing the pouring.When I was invited to join friends on their visit to Queen Creek Olive Mill during the Harvest Festival, I jumped at the chance to play 'tourist' in my home state.There are a lot of things to like here, and we saw all of them: - Lunch in the Eatery at the Mill - while I thought the food was just OK, the cupcakes I tried later (Meyer Lemon and Vanilla Bean) were amazing!- Olive Oil 101 class ($5 per person) - lots of good information on how olive oil is made.  I learned why I cannot stand the taste of black olives from a can, but loved the green olives at the Mill - it is all in the preparation!- Marketplace - I cannot pass up an opportunity to shop!  The Marketplace had a nice assortment of olive oils, balsamic vinegars, olive-oil based bath & body products as well as a selection of gift items and wines.  I managed to hold back just a little, but still walked out with some great things including a super tasty Asiago Parmesan tapenade, Meyer Lemon olive oil and strawberry balsamic vinegar.  I told myself they would make great gifts, but let's face it, I will keep them all for myself.Make an afternoon of your visit!  Enjoy the gorgeous weather while listening to the live music outside and savoring some wines from the Marketplace.  Cheers!Free Olive Oil 101 class with check-in! This place is crazy. Part breakfast spot, part olive oil mill, part tourist trap... the freaking hat trick of out-of-town experiences. I came here with a large group not fully knowing what to expect, I mean Queen Creek Olive Mill? Is this some kind locally based Marie Calendar's? Not really, but sorta?Lets start with breakfast. This is not the type of place where you sit down and a server takes your order. You first walk-in and grab a menu, slowly making your way to the counter where order your breakfast or lunch. You'll then get a food beeper and either sit inside or outside. I'll suggest inside for you, unless you like flies trying to steal a bite of your food. We sat outside and the view was nice, but like I mentioned before, flies bruh. Also if you come here with a big party, try to order all at the same time. Ordering separately will most likely result in someone finishing his or her meal while the others have been summoned by the food beeper. This happened to us and I felt rushed being once of the last ones to get food, but whatever you live and learn. I ordered Olive Farmers Breakfast: Two eggs, herb roasted smashed potatoes, maple sausage, and toasted farm bread (sourdough). I went against my breakfast instinct and played it safe with this traditional plate and it was pretty lackluster. This was something I could have easily made at home, basic eggs, potatoes, and very dry sausage. My GF ordered the Olive Mill Benedict and with one bite, I had breakfast envy. I also ordered a "Bloody Caesar". This was pretty much V8 with vodka wine. No flavor or spice, I had to add everything else myself. The store inside the Queen Creek Olive Mill was a nice touch. Everything from olive oil based soaps, olive tapenades, multiple stuffed olive concoctions, even chocolate covered almonds made to look like olives. And yes, of course, olive oil as far as the eye could see. Great spot to pick up a few gifts for friends and family. This place is a little pricey and far off the beaten path, but if you live near by and have yet to come, it's worth a Saturday afternoon stroll.
Mon Nan=Commonly known as the best Pekin duck in mtl (according to my chinese friends)This restaurant used to be on Clark second floor, across from maison VIP, but now it's moved to la gauchetiere and st-dominique, first floor.If you come here you have to get the Pekin duck, it's their best dish bar none. My only complaint is you never seem to get enough pancakes, and when you order more it takes a long time to come... Pekin duck is a 3 dish affair, they use the whole duck. Comes with soup first from the bones, then it's the Pekin duck with pancakes sauce and pickled carrots and dicon radish. Lastly chop suey with duck meat, you can ask them to turn this dish into a noodle dish for an extra charge.The salt baked squid is quite good, good saltiness and mildly crispy and soft inside. The mongolian beef here is decent except it's just too sweet...sweet and sour pork here is just average, nothing to crow about. It's one of my favorite dishes eventhough according to my chinese friends it's not authentic chinese but more north american chinese...Whatever one of them told me general tao's was not a real sichuan dish... low and behold i went to China no less and found it on their menu... turns out it's a real sichuan dish except they use sichuan peppercorn in china but not here, something to do with customs and peppercorn pest infestation... so there's variations in north american and chinese versions of dishes...All in all, it's just like all the chinese restaurants in chinatown MTL, they're all about same same, except they make one dish better that anyone else, and this one has the best Pekin duck.
Beijing Chinese Cuisine=-Friendly service, very attentive, slow to bring bill.-Food was average, a bit on the extreme salty side.-Prices were a bit high, but they offer evening dinner specials for $6.99.-Server talked us into ordering the Wonton soup-Large was $7.95 with skimpy portions (a few wontons, sliced chicken, tough beef, 2-3 shrimp, half cup of cabbage) and lots of bland broth. Not worth the price.-Restroom clean, but no soap in Women's restroom.-Decor was very nice.-Parking is very convenient.-Next door to a Barber shop.
Vogue Bistro=What a lovely surprise located in...well...Surprise! Mr. Hottie and I decided to have dinner somewhere different. The plan was left to me so I decided to head out to Surprise. I have heard some rumblings of a new bistro out there so I hopped on Yelp to look it up. I made a reservation for 8pm and headed out the door. When we arrived we were immediately struck by the nice decor and cool music. We were greeted warmly and had to wait only a few moments to be seated. We got a nice dimly lit corner table, perfect. We surveyed the patrons, while the website does say the attire is casual, I wouldn't suggest coming in shorts and a t-shirt. Those who did, didn't look like they belonged. Maybe shorts and a polo? Maybe. Anyway, onto our visit. Our hostess seated us and asked us if we had been there before. We responded no and she went on to thank us for our visit and welcome us to the bistro. What was cool about her greeting was that it wasn't like she was running through a script in her mind, it was actually a genuine welcome! No dead behind the eyes Scottsdale hostess here! Our waitress, Jessica was friendly and bubbly. She usually worked the lunch shift so she was a tad shaky on dinner service but we were forgiving. She was doing a great job and trying really hard to make sure we were happy. We started out with a martini. Mr. Hottie had a "Stuffed Goose" which is Grey Goose with stuffed blue cheese olives. I had the Valentino, a pomegranate martini. We both enjoyed our cocktails. We also ordered a 2004 petit syrah to go with our dinner. Ahh.. dinner. Let's start with the appetizer. (Tree hugger/PETA member beware) We ordered the foie gras. The plate was very unceremoniously dropped onto our table by a food runner. She didn't even announce what the food was, just sort of plopped it in front of us and said "There ya go!". Not kidding. Oh well, a minor hiccup. While I was expecting a nice seared piece of duck liver, we got something more in the line of pate. It came with hunks of toast and a compote of apple and figs. It was still VERY delicious. Not as savory as a seared piece of liver, it was still very yummy and I will get it again. We also shared a beet and goat cheese salad. I grew up thinking that I detested beets. They came out of a can, and they tasted like pennies. WRONG. I actually got coaxed into trying beets again and they were so yummy! The goat cheese with the beets were great! The bed of arugula was a little much for me, but that's a personal choice.  Mmm Dinner...We both ordered something from the Chef's entrees of the day. Don't be sad when you see the small dinner menu. The chef adds about 3-4 entrees onto that. Mr. Hottie ordered the thick cut pork chop topped with an apple and bacon mixture, and on the side was broccolini and curried cauliflower, talk about savory and spicy (not HOT but just full of flavor). The pork chop was perfectly cooked, if you like your pork chop well done. It wasn't too dry and the meat was moist and tender. The curried cauliflower was crisp and fresh, not at all mushy.  I had the duck breast with sticky rice, cabbage rolls and a slice of roasted pineapple on the bottom. It was DIVINE. The duck breast was juicy and delicious. All the flavors ran together in harmony. The cabbage rolls were just that, a small egg roll filled with cabbage. Sounds simple right? Wrong, the cabbage was so good. It was very well seasoned and the roll wasn't greasy at all. The ONLY thing I would have changed is that the ball of sticky rice was CRUNCHY on the outside. I don't know if that was the intention of the chef, but being a sticky rice/ any rice eater, it came off as though the rice had been left out to dry. Other than that, heaven. We took our time with our dinner, sat, drank wine, and surveyed the area again. The chef had made an appearance at the table next to us. I understand that one of the gentlemen at at the table was from France and that is where the Chef is from. So she made a very friendly visit. As our dinner lulled and the restaurant emptied a bit, we were hoping the chef would stop by to say hello as she was blowing out candles around us, but she left us alone with our wine. Oh well, maybe next time I'll grab her. After all there was a lot of hand holding and goo goo eyes going on at our table. Maybe she didn't want to interrupt. We did get visits from the Chefs Hunky Husband who was very courteous, and the Hostess came by again to make sure our visit was going well. Talk about great service! Vogue Bistro is a breath of fresh air in an area riddled with chain establishments. I suggest restaurant owners take notice and maybe form a restaurant row or something. Wouldn't that be cool!I have a feeling that Vogue Bistro will be on my list of places to go whenever I'm way out west. This place was fantastic and a must try!Nice place.  The outdoor patio is enclosed and has a fireplace with a bunch of nice tables.We were there on a Saturday night between 5-7pm and it was EMPTY.   The head chef is really nice and she asks for feedback on her food.The food is AWESOME.  I had the scallop special... they were EXCELLENT.  No rubbery mess... it was soft and cooked.  The sweet potatoes were great.  I tried a friend's steak... awesome... and I tried the duck.  Even more awesome.I truly was surprised.Then comes the alcohol, my favorite part. heheI had two martinis... the De La Renta and the... oh man. I can't remember the second one.  The waitress suggested it so I never asked for it by name.   The martinis were great.  Some martinis taste way too much like vodka... these were great and fruity.The service was awesome... very friendly.The music... I know it's meant to be classy with the opera... it was like "Pavaratti and Friends" or something like that... it was way too loud and overwhelmed everything inside. We kept asking them to turn it down.But otherwise, it was great.My 6 best girl-friends and I decided to give Vogue Bistro a try after hearing a rave review from a family member. We eagerly arrived on a Friday evening and found the house was packed! We did have a reservation and were seated promptly outside on the patio. Walking through the restaurant showed us a lovely sophisticated dining room with just the right volume of music. The restaurant was brimming with patrons. And then there's the patio.....Vogue Bistro is located at the far end of a strip mall and it backs up to a residential neighborhood. I suppose that explains the cats who were milling around outside on the patio looking for scraps of anything delectable that might come their way. I am hoping that it wasn't a sign that perhaps there were rodents in the area as well, but given that there is so much seafood on the menu, I am hopeful that this is what drew the cats to the patio. Not that we minded the feline visitors....but it's just not something you typically expect. The patio is ok. They do have heaters in case it is a cool evening, but, overall, the dining experience is a bit lacking if you have to dine on the patio...if not for the cats but for the lack of ambiance. The cuisine at Vogue is refreshingly upscale without the upscale price. The chef is pleasant and friendly and works her ass off in the kitchen. There are so many chefs in the Valley who don't actually cook anymore, rather they stand in the kitchen yelling. Oh wait..and they are usually men. hahaha. We enjoyed the flat bread as well as a recommended appetizer of the day which was slow to arrive, but worth the wait. My dining companions enjoyed a variety of dishes from the skewers to the meatloaf to the delicious hamburgers. Again, the meals were very slow to arrive, but once they did, they were delicious. Our server was pleasant, but seemed put out by our large table. This did reflect on her tip overall, I regret to say since our bill was well over $100. One surprise at Vogue was the treat of the most delicious margarita that we've ever tasted. The agave nectar was house made and I truly think that was the key. Overall, I would say that Vogue Bistro is a very nice change in the typical chain restaurant laden experiences you find in Surprise, but be prepared to be there for a while. This is an experience you want to savor.Talk about a FEZ knock-off.  Here I was, all excited to see something interesting pop up in the boondocks of the valley and this is what I get?  What a waste!To start, this place is small.  Not that small is a knock on a place (I love Matt's) but this is just inefficient use of space.  They've added some sun-shade and a patio to create more tables but it just looks tacky.  The bar takes up almost half of the interior space and does not appear to do the business that the tables do.  Poor execution of use of space.Then, the waiter we had was a pretentious ass.  He was pushy, insistent, and not helpful.  It is amazing he even asked for our orders and didn't just bring us what he thought we should be eating.We had some sweet potato fries and calamari for appetizers.  The fries were good but no where near as good as FEZ.  The calamari was more fried carrots and lemon than meat.  The fried carrots were fine but the whole thing was pretty cheaply put together.What they don't tell you online is that almost all of their sandwiches are not served after 4.  Since that eliminated everything that looked good on the menu, the wife and I ordered a bunch of sides and split them.  The mac & cheese was pretty good.  The cornbread was fine.  The garlic mash was missing the garlic.  Really disappointing.  This is not a place would would recommend, even if I lived out there.  If I were stuck out in Surprise, I would go to the BabbO on Bell before I wasted my time at Vogue.This is my response to Roman Y's very rude comment on my original review: Trust me Roman, you can't make this stuff up. I assure you, I am not a competitor. I'm a mom, and a foodie. I do know a lot about customer service though. I have worked in the service industry for years, and both of my experiences at Vogue were textbook examples of what NOT to do. Exactly what would be my motivation for making up a review? Isn't the point of Yelp to learn reviews from the customers? In a way, it's kind of like having secret shoppers. Furthermore, if you don't want to hear reviews about your restaurant, don't put yourself out there. A smart business owner uses criticism to improve their business. This is just another example of making excuses instead of just fixing the problems. No restaurant can be perfect all the time, but when those problems are brought to your attention, you, as the owner should go out of your way to make it right, not give me a long story about how it's not your fault, and there's nothing you can do about it. I'm willing to forgive a lot when a manager or owner makes a sincere effort to correct, and then go the extra mile to retain my business. The bottom line is, I WANTED to like this place. I was excited for the opening. Our first visit was the week of the opening so I figured that was why we had such a crazy bad experience (it's still no excuse). But when we decided to give it a second chance several months later, and it was still terrible, I was very disappointed. You can get on here and call me a liar if you like, Roman. But, it will not make your restaurant better, and it will not change the fact that I had two memorably bad experiences which I have told to everyone I know.I can back up Kendra's statement about the menus as well. We had to wait ten minutes for a menu because there were non available.Finally made it here for dinner service.  Made a reservation for 4 at 8pm and was seated immediately at 750pm when we got there.  The hostess asked if we care for outdoor dinning, which is not my normal option, but I felt like trying something different.  So we ended up in the great outdoors on the patio.The outdoor patio is nice with a roaring fire, overhead heaters, and plenty of seating.  It is only open on one side, which faces a back alley.  Not really a star gazing setting and every so often you are a few feet away from a speeding car using the alley.  I think I will eat inside next time, wish the patio had more views, but not much to look at here.  I can also note that being outside, at least in our case reduced attention by the staff.  I almost felt forgotten at times as my soda sat empty waiting for a refill.  I would have to speak up if I wanted a refill.  I would not of noticed, but we did not receive dinner till 830pm.  So be prepared for a 30 minute wait for dinner.  I decided to go with the one of the dinner specials which was the pork tenderloin.  The polenta had an excellent taste, but was on the dry side.  Almost like it sat for awhile.  Like a film on top of it had formed on it.  The balsamic reduction was good and almost saved the dish.  With the balsamic reduction the pork tenderloin was edible.  I used the balsamic reduction t add moisture to the pork.  The pork was so over cooked that I could not eat the dry meat without dipping it into the sauce.  I could not even finish 1 tenderloin on my plate.  I usually do not send dishes back and I was trying to eat it without complaint.  Luckily Aura C. waved down a waitress and they took it away.  They did inform me that I could have something else, but at the cost of another 30 minutes of our time.  I think I lost my appetite at that point.Another dinner guest of ours noted lipstick staining on her water glass.  She ending up drinking a soda and let her water glass sit.  So after a long hour for dinner I noted our waitress came to our table a total of 4 times, that included taking the order, taking my dish away, asking if we care for desert, and taking the bill.  Of the 4 times we had to wave her down to note the pork was dry.  I can recommend lunch service, I have had great service then and good food.  I cannot recommend dinner service however.  With such inconsistent service, food, and staff I am sure I would not bring my out of town friends here to enjoy food and the city.  I can say it is a great lunch stop, but dinner still seems to need some work.  I am still trying to put this restaurant on a must eat list since it is only minutes from my house.  Looks like I need to travel still to get good service and food.There were so many things wrong with this place. Even though we had a reservation, we had to wait 15 minutes to get seated after our scheduled time. First off, let me say that I have lived in Paris and other parts of France but it has been many years.AMBIANCE: Eclectic decor, imagine black, white, and pink. Unfortunately, my view was of a huge flat screen TV in a gilded frame over the bar with a basketball game playing. If this "embodies Aurore's vision of an original authentic restaurant" I'd like to know what bistro in France she had in mind. I'll be going back to Paris soon, so I'll update my review if I am wrong. Also, not so classy to walk by an open tray of silverware (health code violation?) on the way to being seated, of which our hostess later was wrapping in cloth napkins ON the hostess station at the entrance as her side work. Upon being seated, table was bare: NOTHING, no place setting, no candles, nada. What were we waiting for?FOOD: I was a little surprised (no pun in intended!) to see Italian and other non-French items on the menu such as lasagna and eggplant parmesan. I guess this is what they mean by "classic French techniques with traditional American influences," but again, I'll let you know when I see meatloaf on a Paris bistro menu and eat my words. Forget about the mushroom appetizer; READ: VERY SMALL, as there are only 2 stuffed mushroom caps on the plate. Beforehand, I had asked the waiter if they were portobello, which at first he agreed but then retracted. I can see why. The foie gras was okay, but I would have preferred a seared version of this dish.We waited OVER AN HOUR for our entrees to arrive. And even then, my filet, compared to the other diners at the table who ordered the same, was smaller and overcooked. The sauce was very nice and I can see how this was part of the chef's training. I also liked the potatoes au gratin. Unfortunately, this dish is very small for the price: I've had airplane meals in coach bigger than this. Overall, this place is OVERPRICED.SERVICE: Our waiter had a little bit of an attitude, so this was in line with an authentic French bistro; however, his lack of efficiency and attention to our table was not. He never poured our wine even once after serving it and we never saw him during our long sojourn waiting for our entrees. After he dropped off the entrees, he NEVER came back to even ask how everything was. Actually, he never once asked how anything was. And at the end he only made excuses for why the kitchen could not handle such a busy night. So what's your excuse for poor service?Gordon Ramsay would have a FIELD DAY with this place. Think Amy's Baking Company....everyone here must be in denial of how bad things are. And Ramsay would tear another one on the chef for arrogantly referring to this place as an authentic French bistro "with reasonably priced food of very high quality served by knowledgeable and attentive staff." Maybe people in Surprise who have never traveled internationally or even eaten in an excellent restaurant may think this place is the balls, but she's not fooling me.
Jimmy John's="Welcome to the Best part of your Day."That's what the cashier said to me when I walked in. I gave him a half smile as I really thought about what he said and then placed my order. Ordered a #9 and #10 combos, a good solid Italian and roast beef sandwich respectively.Service speed hasn't changed much. It is still as fast and speedy as ever. My sandwich's are always done before I can even fill up both of my drinks. I bag up the sandwiches, chips and put my drinks in the carrier and walk out. As I started to open the door, the same cashier told me to "Have a great day" and gave me a smile. I really started to think about what he said when I first walked in there. "Welcome to the best part of your day."He didn't know I was having a crappy day. That I was at work since 4:30 in the morning, finally getting a break from work at 1 pm even if it was just to drive a pick my president up a sandwich. He didn't know that I was stuck in a 4 hour meeting today. Nor did he know the handful of new policies I had to write and implement once I got back to work.I drove back to work thinking, that man was ALMOST right. The best part of my day is always coming home to my hunny and son but other than that, it was a good part of my day. I am not trying to be too personal but I just need to relate a little and make you feel how important customer service truly is (at least to me). As stated in my previous review about Jimmy Johns, they have a good solid sub. Love their pickles and cookies even more. You can't go wrong with their food. However, this location had lacked in the customer service department. And in a business where customer service is YOUR business, it is a very important detail. And during my last couple of visits, the service has been better but not great but after today, I just had to do an update and upgrade them to a 4.Thank you Jimmy Johns for giving me one part of the best part of my day!
Z Pizza=I volunteered myself to help the new boss from Dallas move his mattresses from storage to his new home by buying a truck 4 years ago. FNG.I had put in a few hours at work, and started to get that grumpiness that can only mean that it is time for a bite. You see without food the grumpiness evolves into rash hostility and I decided it was far too soon to pummel my new boss with his own queen sized pillow top mattress.I decided to finally try Z-Pizza as it is right down the street. I ordered a slice, a salad and a soda, while chuckling at the aliteration.The girl working the counter had that first job perkiness to her which was enjoyable. She really seemed to hope that I enjoyed my first trip.The pizza was tasty, thin crust healthyish style. I was a little sad that I had to wait for my salad while I had my pizza, because I planned to eat the salad first making sure the last taste I left with was delicious pizza, but as it turned out the pear and garganzola salad was the highlight of the meal. The walnuts were not over candied, the pears were fresh and ripe, it was perfect for taking away the grumps.I did not throw mattresses.
Honey Pig=A place called "Honey Pig," how can you not like it?!  We've been on a mission to try out this Korean restaurant after passing by and seeing heaping piles of food being grilled in the center of the tables.Last night, with a party of five, we finally had a chance.  We knew right away it was best to get a combo - so #2 Honey Pig Combo for $59.99 it was.  It's meant for about three to four people, so we figured we could add more later on.  It comes with Korean Pork, Beef Prime, Neck Flesh of Pork, Hot Baby Octopus, Seafood Bean Paste Soup, Fried Rice, and either 1 bottle of Soju or Korean Beer.After putting in our order, the waiter came back with iced Korean tea.  This was actually the first time I have ever seen the tea served on ice and it was very refreshing.  Something so nice needs to be served in tall glasses instead of small regular tea cups.About nine different banchan was brought over, which included cabbage kim chee, bean sprouts, cucumber kim chee, green onion salad, fish cake, tiny fish, raw garlic, sliced jalapenos, pickled daikon, a bean dipping paste, and my favorite - sesame oil with Korean salt.  He only brought over one dish of each, so we were soon requesting refills on just about everything.The raw foods were soon to arrive and the waiter laid out the beef and pork onto the hot wok-like grill in the center.  He also added some bean sprouts and cabbage to the middle.  As we waited for our meat to cook, we dove into the banchan.  We also asked about the rice, which he then brought over five bowls of steamed white rice ($2/each).As we devoured our meat and our grill became empty, we sat around wondering about our octopus.  It was sitting in a bowl on the next table, but we weren't sure what to do next since they had shut our fire off.  When we finally got their attention, they asked if we wanted our bill.  We asked about the octopus, and only then did he realize that it was still sitting raw on the next table.  So, he turned on the grill and cooked the octopus.  The BF asked about the soup, and only then did the waiter ask if we wanted our fried rice.  (Uh...yeah!)  We were quite bothered by this since they were already asking us if we wanted to pay and we hadn't received half of our meal still!  The fried rice was also added to the grill and we got two bowls of the soup to share amongst us.We really enjoyed the food - it was tasty, great flavor, and just a good meal overall.  4 stars for food.The service on the other hand is what makes me frustrated.  We were forgotten about, and I'm not sure if it's because we were in the corner or what.  We always had to ask about getting our tea refilled, and when we asked if we could just have the pitcher, they said no. (They only had one pitcher!)  I asked for more napkins, which never arrived until I asked again.  The different waiters would come by and shut the heat off before our food was cooked and it was just so hard to get their attention.  (One waiter finally mentioned that they were understaffed with only three waiters that night.  They just looked unorganized.)  We finally said we were ready for the check, which also took forever to come!  (Did they want us to pay or not?)  2 stars for the service.I'm used to getting shikhye at the end of the meal, but they didn't have it here either!  Argh!I definitely want to go back, but I can only hope the service will be a lot better the next time!  (And I'm sure we're going to bring a larger party the next time we come too!)Sidenote: They offer a 20% from 10 pm to 8 am.  Are they open 24 hours then?  I'm not sure! (You can find pics of our dinner in the business profile!)All You Can Eat awesomeness for only $20 a head.  I'm from San Jose, CA and it gets pretty damn pricey for All You Can Eat Korean BBQ.  Being in Vegas, don't come here right before a night out or you'll smell like food the whole night.  Come here strictly for eating.  All you can eat is now for a limited time during the evening so make sure you check first.  But this place is still good to order off the menu.  But if you're hungry....go during All You Can Eat hours....SUPER worth it.My boyfriend and my homies came here this past weekend and I treated for Mother's Day.  It was definitely worth it at $20 per person because we ate A LOT.  We ordered like 5 orders of beef tongue, 2 orders of pork belly, 1 order of roast beef, 1 order of BBQ ribs, 2 order thinly sliced beef, and we even got the small calf intestines.    Everything tasted good.  All the meat was flavorful, was well marinated, and easy to cook.  They help you out in the beginning, but while you're sitting there, you get to finish off the cooking yourself. I don't recommend the roast beef though because its cubed.  I like thin sliced.  Faster to cook and tastes way better.The salad, kim chi, sprouts, and other side dishes were all good too.  Be careful though, they can make you full.  But the salad is yummy...no need for rice!Come here in a group.  It is a fun and interacitve  dining experience that should be shared among good people on a good night for good vibes!3.5 stars.  I prefer going here over Kaya or Woo-che for sure though if I'm doing AYCE on Spring Mountain.  My wife and I just get continuous doses of the beef tongue, pork belly (my fav) and the marinated beef.  I also love the grilled kimchi and bean sprouts. Wash that all down w/ Hite beer and there's a great Korean party going on in my stomach.I'm taking a half star off for the service but it wasn't that big of a detterant.  It just could've been better.Wow the service here sucks. I really need to be Korean to get anything around here. I had to ask for my banchan to be brought......... really?  I thought it's gratuitously given without question.  Other than that, service was nonexistent for the rest of the night.  You are forewarned.  Don't come here if you don't speak Korean.Updated: Angry and confused, I left $0 tip for the sub-sub-par service with a note saying "Thank you for your service".  As I was leaving the restaurant, the waiter came running out screaming "Sir, you didn't leave tip".  I kindly asked him rhetorically "Well....how much do you think the tip should be?"  In a swift motion, while running back into the store he said "You can just keep it".  And so I did.The bbq is very good, but the service is horrible. They won't tend to you if you're not Korean. I thought it was a figure of my imagination when it happen the first 2 times I went, but nope. The third and last time I ate there was for my dad's birthday. We walked in and was waiting 10 mins because the restaurant looked busy. Another group walked in after that (who were Korean), and the server finally looks over and I told her party of 4. She ignores me and takes the group of 8 behind me. I looked at her in disbelief confronted her that we were waiting first. She finally seats us next to the door. Then they made us wait 20 minutes before giving us a menu and asking what we would like to drink. I will never go back. JIN MEE's restaurant is way better!!!I left cold, hungry and penniless.My friends and I were in the mood for AYCE Koren BBQ and this place was on my must try list.  Upon walking through the door, we were promptly greeted, seated toward the front of the restaurant, received a pitcher of water and a couple menus.  Within minutes we ordered the pork belly, spicy pork belly, kalbi and the boneless sirloin (I forget what it's called) all off the AYCE menu.The waitress came back with our four different banchan, the sirloin and put kim chee, sprouts and pork belly on the grill.  From there it all went downhill...slowly.  We devoured the pork belly, but the lady had turned the fire off so we kind of just sat there wondering what we should do.  Meanwhile, every time people came through the front door, it wouldn't close.  Which meant the frigid night air was blowing right on us and other tables seated near the front.  Without complaining, we kept standing up to close it.  You'd think that after about 20 times of doing this (along with the other table near us) some employee would have seen us and offered to fix it.  But you'd be wrong.  Finally, a nice waitress [the only nice one?] came by and we immediately bombarded her with requests: if she could somehow fix the door; please start the fire again; could we get more food, water and banchan; and we asked for steamed rice.  It took about 15 minutes before ANYONE came within earshot of our table.  Why on earth would it take 15 minutes to get water refilled, let alone more food?  This is a restaurant, right?  They serve food here, right?  Regardless, we were finally able to defrost and we finally had some food and water!  Woo hoo!  Warning: buzz kill coming.  About halfway through the sirloin, we started wondering when the rest of our food was coming.  And we kept wondering until one of my friends stood up, walked to the counter and ASKED for food: kalbi, spicy pork belly and more rice.  Shortly thereafter, the spicy pork arrived...but no rice.  Not so shortly thereafter, my friend had to STAND UP AGAIN AND ASK for the kalbi.  This time we tried to be smart about it and order three orders.  Nope, they said.  We could only have ONE order per table.  Um, hello, the menu does say one order, but it's one per person.  Regardless, we were hungry and tired of waiting so we took what we could get...but no rice.After finishing the one order of kalbi, we still wanted more.  However, having sat there for more than 2 hours and having only four small orders delivered, we were fed up of not being fed.  We were tired, frustrated, cold (they turned off the heat again) and the servers were avoiding eye contact with us.  In fact, they didn't even drop the bill.  We had to walk up to the counter and ASK FOR OUR BILL!!!  Talk about insult to injury!  Having been near the door, we could have just walked out without paying and no one would have noticed us gone.    However, being people of principle, we paid our $60+ dollars for the "food."  Then we left...to go eat somewhere else.  Despite having AYCE, we were STILL HUNGRY!!!We were so excited to come here because the one in LA is really good and had pretty good reviews on here. But we were sorely disappointed in the customer service and AYCE policy.  The food tasted okay for the most part though. It is located in a plaza in Chinatown, not on the LV Strip.  We got here about 8 pm and there was no wait.  When we got to our table, we noticed this huge domed grill, it looked like a lid or an overturned wok.  It was cool.  We ended up with AYCE for our group of 6 at $19.99 each.  When we proceeded to order our favorites, we were told we can only order 2 items at a time.  We are used to limited items, but usually 4-5, which was fine.  After we cooked the first batch, they told us we had to finish everything before they would take our order for the next round.  Our grill was sitting there empty while we were starving & waiting for our food to be brought out by the wait staff.  Other tables had full grills most of the time, while we sat there with nothing on ours.  We ordered different items on the menu including:beef tongue - good, thin sliced meatspicy octopus - quarter sized when cooked, was okaykalbi (short ribs) - marinated fatty meat, not great :(sides - not so fresh, marinated cucumbers had a weird flavordipping sauces - did not look appetizing eitherspicy "bulgogi" (brisket) - kinda weird looking...  this did not look like our usual bulgogi, so we asked about it.  Us:  What is that? (as we pointed to it cooking on the grill)Waiter:  It's spicy bulgogiUs:  It doesn't look like bulgogiWaiter:  It's brisket with other meats all clumped togetherUs:  Huh?Waiter:  It has other meats and brisket mixed togetherUs:  (We still had quote bubbles with question marks)  I just looks like pork, didn't we order brisket?We would have tried other meats, but we were only "allowed" to eat so much due to being micro-managed by the waiter/waitress not giving us our food.After we got on our car and started pulling away, the 2 servers ran up to our car saying they charged the wrong amount.  Even though they charged the wrong amount, we totaled it correctly and made sure to tip.  I asked, did you even look at what we gave total?  He didn't and said, "oh, you paid the correct amount and tipped too?"  It made is feel like we were trying to not pay. Then complained we only gave $20 tip.I will give 3 stars for the flavors of the meats & sides, but need to take 2 stars off for service.I would suggest to order from the menu a la carte instead of AYCE, you'll probably be more satisfied.  We probably would have been charged half the price considering how much we ate, actually it was more like how much they wanted to give us.If you want to be micromanaged when eating, having someone tell you how much to eat at an AYCE place and getting a smirk for "only" giving $20 tip, then come here.  Otherwise, there are so many other buffets in Vegas that are so much more worth it.  The AYCE Korean BBQs in Los Angeles are SO MUCH BETTER, food-wise and service wise.  The waitstaff need to go to Customer Service 101 classes.Note:  This is my 1st less than 3 star review out of 80 that I've written.  Definitely not worth it for the service as others have said.  Disappointed!  :(As many of my yelp friends know, I am still an activist for anti-discrimination of Asian-Americans. Many of the top Asian-American elitists who are members of our organization meet together once a month. 99% of the the time we meet at either Sushi on Rainbow or HONEY PIG. It's just become our spot to discuss business. Also, we consider the honorable Mr. Jake Lee to be quite a respected figure in the LV Asian-American community, so we eat here to show our respects to him. Mr. Lee is so respected that even the Japanese members of our agency see him as a great role model for their community.I'm a Yakiniku guy. But, HONEY PIG is the only Korean BBQ that I would prefer over Yakiniku(for those of you who do not know, Yakiniku is the Japanese variation of Korean BBQ). Yakiniku restaurants are known for using very high quality meats, but the beef at HONEY PIG is much more tender and higher in quality than even the most expensive Yakiniku joints in San Diego or LA.There are lots of really good choices here in LV for AYCE Korean BBQ, but they just can't compare to HONEY PIG. Sura is also a great choice, but it can't touch THE PIG.  Don't get me wrong, I love Sura and the service is really good but HONEY PIG just has much more superior quality meats and it's  always perfectly marinaded. I hate how at the other Korean BBQ joints in town, they rush the preparations and the meat does not have that full flavor of the marinade. You won't get that problem here at THE PIG.   Just to let you yelpers know, you can't satisfy Korean customers. You can bring your Korean friends to the best Korean restaurant in the world and they will still give it 1-star.  Korean's always compare restaurants to their mother's cooking and if it doesn't taste like Mom's kalbi then it officially "sucks" to them. So if you are Korean, then maybe don't come here. If you are Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, etc then come on over.  Some yelpers are claiming that the staff won't treat you well unless you are Korean. That's just not true. Most of us are very visibly Japanese, and we get VIP treatment.  I don't know, maybe they just treat us good because we spend so much money.  I mean, if you are Asian-American and your household doesn't have investments and assets worth at least over 1.5 million, you probably should be pretty embarrassed to call yourself Asian.Mr. Lee does a very good job with his restaurants. I see some people wondering if the HONEY PIG in Los Angeles is related to this location, and the answer is that his brother owns that one. All I can say is that I got nothing but respect for Mr. Lee and his HONEY PIG. What a great restaurant to have here in LV.So I've been meaning to write an update for Honey Pig. A few months ago I decided to give Honey Pig another chance, and I've been completely happy with the service since then! It has become my "regular" Korean bbq spot. Since I've been going there so much, they know me by now and are very much attentive whenever my boyfriend and I walk in. They immediately bring over the AYCE menu and the brisket dipping sauce that we love so much! (if you haven't tried it, be sure to ask for it, it tastes good with everything!) I honestly couldn't ask for better service. Also, their pork belly has defeated all other pork bellies in any other Korean bbq restaurant (for me at least). Last time I ordered pork belly at a Korean bbq restaurant in California, it tasted so bland and flavorless. Honey Pig's pork belly is so full of flavor that you almost feel like you just can't stop eating it. My boyfriend has even grown to love it, and he's not a big fan of pork belly.If you are in Vegas and looking for a great AYCE Korean bbq  restaurant, this is your place. AYCE is served until 10 pm, but as long as you get there before 10, they'll serve you past that time.This place jumps all over with me. Hit or miss. Was victim of some bamboozlement a few visits ago, but I think the last visit made up for it. If you've been here before and the menu seems a little fishy, demand for the LOCAL MENU!!! I'll leave it at that...Had some visitors from Minnesota during our cold front. Two were noobs and the other two were well experienced Korean BBQ specialists. We all jump on the AYCE menu. Banchan sides were set with a bunch of garlic and jalapeno peppers.                     (please forgive me if I spelled the food incorrectly)Round 1:Beef brisket (Chadol Baegi) and beef tongue (Gyutan). It's what's for dinner. Noobies weren't big fans of the beef tongue. Both tasted good, although I prefer the brisket over anything that can taste me back.Round 2, 3, & 4:Pork Belly (Samgyeopsal). This was THE BUSINESS!!! These cuts were GIANORMOUS!!! Even the noobies were in awe by the majestic slabs of pork belly staring them in their eyes. PORK BELLY GET IN MY BELLY!!! Round 5: Marinated beef short ribs (Galbi). We finished off the feeding with something marinated. Not that big of a fan, but it was good. I'll pho'ks with it. Honey Pig's brisket and pork belly got me hooked again. Only time will tell if they can stay consistent. We've been lucky to keep getting the same waitress which is on top of her game. I'll be watching for anymore bamboozlement. YAY! I'M A FAN!!!I am conflicted on how to rate Honey Pig. I liked the quality of the meat and the fact that they basically cook everything for you. What I am not a huge fan of is how understaffed they are, the upcharge on items without notice, the lack of kalbi during lunch, and the limitation of it on dinner. We rolled in as a large party of 10 and sat in the back. It took some time for the lady to get to us and start the grill. Half our party was eating while the rest of us were waiting to start. When we began, we were happy with the food for the most part. The meat could have used some seasoning if the sesame oil dipping sauce was not to come with salt. The marinated meat just tasted too sweet.Once we got started, the attendant started to loosen up. We didn't eat that much and asked for the bill halfway through. It threw her off and she kept offering to bring out more food if we needed. Overall, she was rather nice, but we all had to get to work or do errands. Honey Pig was decent, but I have other places I would go first if the need for Korean BBQ hits.I went here for lunch and didn't want to go for AYCE. I was just in the mood for some kimchi and Korean BBQ and Yelp kept telling me I needed to go here. So here I went.I walked in and the place was empty. Just two waitresses and they looked at me like I was crazy when I said it was only a party of one. My waitress sat me and gave me a menu but didn't ask me if I wanted anything to drink. When she took my order, she still didn't ask me if I wanted anything to drink. My food came out and she still didn't ask me if I wanted anything. I had to finally ask her. After that I never saw her again, until it was time for me to pay. So I think I can also confirm that the service here is spotty. Maybe they just don't care to be nice. However, my food made up for the experience. It was about $12 before tax and tip. I ordered a lunch plate with meat and noodles and it was good. I really did enjoy my lunch. I left satisfied and full but with the crappy service, I just don't know if I would return.This used to be my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ spot but unfortunately they've raised their prices and shrunk the menu :( You can't do both and expect people to still love you the same!! They have also cut down on the Banchan dishes that they give out as well as the salad. There used to be a variety of greens but now it is just lettuce. BOOTheir service is not to be praised or frowned upon. They will get to you in a timely manner and your initial order of meat will arrive shortly BUT you will not see them much afterwards. It does not matter if they are busy or slow. Their food makes up for everything else. Their pork belly is very good! Probably my favorite out of all the spots I've tried in town. After seeing that their prices have gone up and their menu has shrunk but service has not improved to make up for these factors...I will probably choose to go elsewhere if I am craving Korean BBQFirst problem....they wouldn't up charge us for the honey pig, instead of the Korean pork belly! This is odd because I was happy to pay whatever the difference was between the two! Next, I ask to switch the brisket for the bulgogi...this was also shot down! Both dishes are the EXACT SAME PRICE on their menu! So then I asked why this wasn't allowed...she said because it just wasn't allowed. Soooooo it's not allowed to make ANY CHANGES to a combo...even if it would make the combo more expensive? Smh...bad management! I'm trying to spend more money and buy more products from your business and you can't even explain why substituting isn't allowed? Every waitress in there was rude and acted as if they were slammed...lmao there was three occupied tables and three waitresses!?! It was Wednesday at 10:30pm....I'll take my business to Pho So 1 the next time I'm in that shopping complex!Honey Pig is still one of my favorite Korean BBQ joints in Vegas. The servers are super friendly and frequently check on their customers to see if they need anything. The seafood soon dubu here is one of the best you can order besides the restaurants in korea town L.A. I also recommend the honey comb pork and spicy pork which you can cook yourself on the table or have them cook it for you in the kitchen. All the banchan at Honey Pig is delicious, especially the soy marinated potatoes and fish cake. I believe they have raised all the menu prices not too long ago and it is a little overpriced in my opinion, but I still find myself eating here at least once a month!I'm a little perplexed at this "3 stars average rating" nonsense. Honey Pig is clearly better than that.It's been quite some time since I've done Korean BBQ in Vegas, but there's no way a meat eater can resist a friend's invitation to feast. We arrived around 6pm on a Friday night and beat the dinner rush handily. Our chairs were placed fairly close to each other on purpose, as we would learn later.It was fairly obvious from the a la carte pricing that AYCE ($24.95 all-you-can-eat dinner, supposedly a 2 hour limit, but we didn't reach it) would be the way to go for variety's sake. Late night diners should be aware that although this restaurant is open 24/7, AYCE is only available until 10pm. While they only allow a maximum of one portion of kalbi (beef short ribs) and one portion of beef sirloin with AYCE, the other options (bulgogi, pork belly, spicy pork belly, spicy squid, spicy chicken) are truly unlimited as long as you don't over-order.Before the first round, they brought out banchan (the ubiquitous sides in Korean cuisine), which consist of bean sprouts, mini seafood pancakes, pickled veggies, and spicy cucumbers. The table space is essentially a circular ring that surrounds the circular grill, so the banchan were placed between the two of us. They also provided three dipping sauces (my simplistic summary: one salty, one sweet, and one spicy) and bowls of white rice.For the actual first round, they threw kimchi and bean sprouts onto the grill along with bulgogi, then pork belly after the bulgogi had finished. They staged this on the opposite side of the circular ring so that they didn't get in our way. I wouldn't say that they totally follow through on the cooking process, but they will come back to turn the meat. Still, it feels like you can chopstick your way through it at any time and pull beef early to your liking, and that's a good thing. You should know that the outer edge of the grill will cook things more slowly, so relocate food there to avoid overcooking.Anyway, the bulgogi and pork belly were both good, although I personally preferred the somewhat fatty pork belly. The sweet dipping sauce worked best with both, but I played around for variety's sake.We wanted the kalbi and the beef sirloin for the second round, and they obliged. Both were actually marinated, and both stay pretty tender as long as you don't leave them on the grill for far too long. Yeah, we may have succumbed to this oversight. At least the properly cooked pieces tasted great!Lastly, we had spicy chicken and also convinced them to mix it into an order of fried rice (+$2.95 per person). This fried rice is exciting because they cook it on the grill to pick up the meaty residues of the preceding deliciousness. It was certainly delicious overall. I'll admit that the spicy chicken and the leftover kimchi were a bit intense for me at first, but they were easier to handle once they'd cooled from hot to merely warm. Synergistic heat effects, you know. Anyway, they did allow us to box the leftovers of the fried rice (containing some chicken at this point) to go, and having food for the next day feels like more value than even taking the time to stuff yourself that night.Nothing was totally mindblowing, but everything tasted very good, so why not 5 stars? Well, this is a bit nitpicky, but I'm disappointed with the limit on two types of especially delicious meat. It's understandable since some people can go absolutely H.A.M. on the food, but most places don't have that limit. Then again, my somewhat distant memories give me the impression that most AYCE places offer lower-quality meats. There is a second issue, however, in the lack of attention to giving more banchan. No server offered to bring more banchan, and one server outright said OK to more seafood pancakes, but never brought seconds.I'll have to eat around more to make a more informed comparison, but I'm very comfortable giving Honey Pig 4 stars and decrying the ridiculous underrating by the "average Yelper."
Hon Machi Sushi=I'm not sure why I've been to this restaurant more than once.  My last experience is how I decided to give it a 2-star, maybe I would have given them a 3-star based on prior visits. (At first I was tempted to give it a 1-star but I reserve that rating for visible creepy crawlers, etc.)630 - We arrive to make sure we are in time for Happy Hour. 645 - Our order was taken 653 - Edamame and salad arrive (no utensils, napkins, water or beer).  The lower into the bowl of Edamame we get, the less fresh they taste. 655 - Napkins and utensils arrive.  We ask about our beer and water (it's Happy Hour, remember?!)658 - Water arrives, Happy Hour is over so they take away the menu.702 - Beer arrives (Where are their priorities?)Then sushi arrives and it's mediocre or even worse than mediocre.  Maybe I should say, you get what you pay for?Definitely not going back here.
Das Cafe=Dear Gourmandise,I love you.  With the fire of a thousand suns.Gourmandise is a cute, quirky bistro in downtown Urbana, and they have made my breakfast mornings immeasurably better multiple times now.The first time, I had a bacon breakfast sandwich on a croissant.  Magnificent.  The next time?  The petite omelette special, which is a delicious omelette with bacon and potatoes and cheese (nicely small-sized), paired with a tasty mini roll and a piping hot cup of coffee.  Goodness.Their coffee is the best I've had at any restaurant/eatery in C-U so far, as well.  The staff (I believe the gentleman that owns the place), is extraordinarily friendly and wonderfully engaging.Now, the only thing that confuses/amuses me.  With a name like La Gourmandise, you expect some Francophone schtick.  But when you walk in, there are scenes depicting German country life, and a plethora of German inspired foods as well.  However, another wall sports French art kitsch.  WHERE ARE WE?I've concluded that Gourmandise must be in some tiny spot on the French German border.  Or just Strasbourg.  Whatevs. Delicious.  Go now.
Big Buddha=Based on everybody's reviews, I HAD to try this place out.  I mean really HAD to.  I'm Chinese so I KNOW Chinese food and there's not a whole lot of places to go that's decent on our side of town.  So it's still a good 15-20 miles away from us but we were in the neighborhood so we decided to give it a try.  WOW!Granted, not the best Chinese food I ever had but definitely the best I've had in the West Valley.  I would say if it were in any other place like NY, LA, Houston, I would have given it 3 stars but for Phoenix, definitely 4.  The service was also very good, which you don't usually see in Chinese restaurants.  I ain't hatin' either - it's just the way it is.  :)We  had the Beef Chow Fun, Honey Walnut Shrimp, and Crispy Orange Beef.  The COB wasn't very spicy which was fine by us, but had a nice sweet tangy flavor to it.  It didn't taste like it had much of a layer on it - almost like they  just fried the beef - but it tasted pretty good.  Never eaten it that way before.The HWS had huge shrimp but not a whole lot of it.  Which was fine.  I thought the mayo sort of overpowered the whole dish but it was still better than any other place I've had in the Valley.  Finally, the BCF was the best dish.  I'm a fan of big noodles and they did a good job with the flavoring.We really enjoyed our meal here and will definitely come again.  All the flavoring in their food was pretty good, if not awesome.  Not super salty like Pei Wei can be (my I-don't-have-any-other-choice-but-to-come-here option) but rather just the right touch.  When we got there, pretty much all their tables were full and the conversations I heard several of the patrons had with the waiters/waitress was, "Thanks for coming again, see you next week/time."  DEFINITELY a good sign.  We weren't disappointed!Restaurant week with my mom continued tonight.  She likes Chinese food and this place is only about 5 minutes away from our house.  Seemed like a good time to head on over.  We went inside and were seated immediately.  As soon as I sat down, I felt a little anxiety.  They do a bustling take out business but their waiting area is very tiny and it was right next to our table.  It felt like people were on top of us the whole time.  Every time you would lift your head, someone was there or looking your way.  A little bit uncomfortable.  If there is a next time, hopefully we will sit someone against the wall or something.  Anyways..........placed our order for Diet Cokes and actually used the Yelp check-in app in order to score us 2 free egg rolls!  We decided to go with Mongolian Beef and Orange Peel Chicken.  Here is how everything tasted...............Egg Rolls-  Best part of the meal, by far!  There were 2 of them and you could tell they were homemade and they tasted great.  They are served with a little sweet and sour sauce with a pinch of hot mustard.  The egg rolls and sauce were delicious.  They were hot, fresh, crispy and hearty for being such small things.  I would definitely get them again and maybe even a few orders of them  in addition to the free one you get from the Yelp app. Mongolian Beef-  This was presented nicely with a ton of onions and beef.  I am spoiled though and am used to certain kinds of Chinese food (Golden Chopsticks in National City rings a bell).  I dug in to this and it tasted ok.  The meat was a little tough though and could have been seasoned just a bit more.  Not bad in any way, just nothing compared to other places that I have had Mongolian Beef before.  Portion size seemed just a bit skimp too.  Overall, it was just ok.Orange Peel Chicken-  Once again, I am used to certain things when it comes to Chinese food and this was totally different.  Their Orange Chicken is basically a breaded chicken breast cut up into strips a la chicken katsu.  It was covered in a sweet tasting sauce that was just ok.  The breading on the chicken fell off pretty easily which was kind of annoying.  Once again, the portion was a tad skimp.White Rice-  Rice was ok.  They give you a huge container of it at least.Overall, everything was just alright.  We ate all the food presented to us and didn't have any leftovers (rare with Chinese food...it boils down to the kind of skimp portions though) and were not totally stuffed to the brim.  Service, while friendly, was a tad slow.  Will I come back?  Eh...possibly.  My wife doesn't eat Chinese food other than Pick Up Stix and PF Changs, so I will probably be rolling solo if I do come back.  Nothing was really bad, but nothing stood out as super delicious either.  A-OK about sums it up....maybe even on the low end of A-OK.  Total bill for everything including tip was around $30.00.  Fair enough I guess.
The Codfather=Wow, I came on here to send a link about this place to a friend and was surprised to see so many neg reviews.  My family moved over here from Yorkshire, in the UK, when I was a kid and has been on the look out for good fish and chips ever since!  The Codfather is the first place in 25 years that passed muster.  My folks drive miles all the way from the East Valley to go to this place and I drive up from central Phoenix to join them.  Yorkshire could be considered the epicenter of the fish and chip addicted Brit and even gets riffed on for it.  The couple that own this place imported their fryer equipment and alot of their ingredients from the UK - they even have haddock on the menu which you NEVER see anywhere out here (haddock is a flaky north atlantic white fish that is superior to cod - do not get cod if you can have haddock instead).As I read the neg reviews I realize most of them appear to be reviewing the type of food vs. the restaurant. Its like giving a bad review to an Indian restaurant if you don't like Indian food - not cool.Yes, its a hole in the wall and the owner is a no-nonsense Londoner, and yes, NEWSFLASH: fried food is greasy!  But these are the best authentic British fish and chips you will get.  If you don't like that type of food, don't slam a (small, hard working, family run) restaurant thats doing a really good job at it.Some educational tidbits for the uninitiated:1.They serve chips not fries - chips are soft not crisp2. Ask for/try HP sauce with it - thats what many Brits prefer over ketchup3. Don't get it to go if you can avoid it- the heat of the food in the container continues to steam the food and its not as good (or the batter as crisp) when you get it home4. In the Northern UK you primarily get haddock, in the south its mostly cod, which is greasier - try haddock if you've never had it.5. The reason vinegar is typically applied to fish and chips is to cut the grease - give it a whirlI was born & raised in New England, Moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, visited the UK  and later lived on Maui ,Hawaii so I know good fish & chips. I can speak with some authority when I say here in Phoenix good fish & chips is hard to find. The good news is The Codfather Fish and chips is the way it was meant to be made.  A large crispy coating, and fries deep fried to perfection.  If you are looking for this classic dish, you will not find a better place than the Codfather. GIANT piece of fried fish and it was delicious. Crispy, soft, juicy, flavourful, perfect with a little vinegar. Amazingly delicious. the chips were golden, fluffy, crispy on the outside but not so much that they can't absorb a generous amount of malt vinegar. For the price, could you really ask for moreMy wife & I ordered the cod, which was a HUGE portion and a side of large chips.  The cod was breaded and cooked to a perfectly crispy and crunchy consistency, while still maintaining the moist fish.   FOOD: I ordered the cod, which was a HUGE portion and a side of large chips.  The cod was breaded and cooked to a perfectly crispy and crunchy consistency, while still maintaining the moist fish. I can say that the fish was fresh and the oil that it was cooked in was clean. The fish was fresh as it didn't taste fishy. The fries were lightly fried and it didn't taste too oily which was a good thing. The The chips were delicious ! PRICE: For the price, could you really ask for more.CONCLUSION:  Grab that malt vinegar and pour it on, because this fish and chip stop is the one to enjoy.Been here a few times in the past. Once when they first opened. On my last visit the place was bigger and now serving alcohol. Maybe that is the best way to enjoy this place to the fullest?This is a British style restaurant with Fish and Chips the way they make it back home. My Son-in-law is from England and he LOVES this place. They have several popular items that you would get overseas. Mushy Peas, Bangers / Mash / Gravy, Bubble/Bangers/Beans and many others.Inside is decorated with everything you would expect if you were vacationing in GB. They also have a nice market with items that you may not find in your typical grocery store.We have had the Cod, Haddock, Jalapeno Poppers (LOL) and looking forward to possibly trying the Walleye in a future lifetime.The food is somewhat bland tasting to my palate. Maybe that is how they like it over there. The fish seems a little more greasy than we would prefer and a napkin is needed to soak up the excess. Hmmm?Service is friendly and the dining experience and menu are worth checking out. Would have to say that there are better places for Fish in my opinion. But then again ... this is how they do it over in the Queen's backyard. TALLY HO!3 STARS
That's Italiano=I kept driving by and seeing a sign "Summer Special - Two meals, salad and wine for $40" I had heard decent reviews about this place so we decided to give it a try this week.I was impressed to hear you could choose ANY item on the menu for your salad and entrees; you weren't limited to a smaller selection. We ordered the following:LINGUINE FRUTTI DI MARE ~ Mussels, calamari, shrimps, with Fra Diavolo sauce ($19.95)MELANZANE PARMIGIANA*~ Layers of eggplant with mozzarella, tomato and parmesan ($14.95)2 Salads ($9)Bottle of Sangiovese 'Polesio' ($34)With tax and tip this meal would have been around $100, so walking out paying about half that made for a great dining experience. The food was very authentic, it tasted like you had just stepped in to an old Italian grannies kitchen. The bread was fresh and the ambiance romantic. I'm going with 4 stars, but honestly if we had paid full price, it would probably only be 3.. (Oh and they really should spruce up the bathrooms, they were gross).
Dolce Ristorante=I actually just left the restaurant. Me and three of my friends all went to the restaurant for the first time. It was tiny and very cramped. I actually got elbowed in the head twice by servers. It was also extremely loud! I ordered a ceasar salad. I get the bill and its 16.95 for a salad and water!!! The menu specifically says 6.95. But somehow I'm getting charged 10 dollars extra! So I bring it up and ask why I'm getting charged so much. Apparently I got served a "DINNER" salad even though I ordered a regular salad. I told the server this as well as an older lady, short, redish curly hair, accent, very rude that I was over charged. The server failed to ask and tell me that I was getting a dinner portion even though the menu says NOWHERE that that it what you will get no matter what. The older lady told me that its dinner time so that is what I get. I went on to tell her that that is not what I ordered and that the menu says ceasar salad 6.95. She began talking in circles saying everything over and over again. She blamed everything on the server who was nice just failed to tell me. She also told me that it was my fault because I ate the salad. Yes, really. She told me it was my fault. She said that I did not complain so it's my problem. She also said "You know what, your right mammi. It is my fault because this is not McDonald's and that is where you should be eating." Yep. She actually said that to a customer. I told the waiter that it was not his fault and told her that I would never be eating there again. I never will. I ended up paying 20 dollars for a salad, and to be honest, not a very good one. I'm still fuming at the fact that someone actually said that to me. It's not about the money, it's about what I ordered and what I was sneakily being charged for and when I asked about it I got yelled at. Classy
Thai Elephant=Holy Elephant Balls, Buddha! This place is incurrydible!!! Okay, okay I'll stop.So my wife and I decided to hook up for lunch.  She works downtown so I decided to head down that way and pick her up.  I suggested Thai Elephant because I had never been, and she raved about the Pad Thai she had ordered a couple weeks ago.  It's located on Adams just West of Central Ave., and parking is scarce.  Make sure to have some change for the meter!I knew I was at home when I saw the "People Love Us On Yelp" sticker on their door.  It was about 1 pm so the lunch crowd wasn't in FULL effect.  There were about 10 empty tables in which we had our pick. We sat by the window.  My wife ordered the Drunken Noodles with Chicken (a la medium), and I ordered the Green Curry with Chicken (a la medium).  A round of Thai Tea was also added to the bill.  Our food came out in about 4 minutes, which came as a shocker! Yes, I said shocker... I was pleasantly surprised!The moment I slammed my chompers onto the emerald dripping chicken, I became green with envy. Envious of all the people who have eaten here in the past and had such a precious secret hidden up their sleeves.  I sniffled a bit, but not from emotion.  It was the green curry and its beautiful spices stroking my mucus glands in just the right way.  A bit of rice and a sip of the Thai Tea (I'll get into in a second) and I was right back on track.The Thai Tea. Ooohhhh, the Thai Tea!  It was $2.50 and twice as large as the ones I order from The Street.  It was like being chosen by Ganghis Khan to sit alongside him in Xanadu and drink the Milk of Paradise (Rush Reference).  It was sweet, as you would expect paradise to be, and creamy. I began to float out of my chair and harpies wiped my nose as I sipped the golden brown goblet of goodness.Service was SpectacularFood was FabulousPortions were PhenomenalDare I say it? 5 Big Ones, Mr. Elephant... and I shall return!While waiting for Ayesha to have dinner at Thai Elephant, I tried not to let the meth-crack-head who pretended to talk on the pay phone deter me from a great meal.  She had no shoes on and walked up to the pay phone and started talking.  It hadn't been ringing and she didn't dial a number.  I'm a sucker for Touch of Thai's catfish dish, and they had the same one on the menu.  It was good, but the fish was a bit overcooked.  I would have liked a bit more "sauce" as the dish was a bit dry.Service was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without asking throughout our meal.Of course, spending and evening with Ayesha over spicy food as we both wiped our noses from the heat of curry can't be beat!service - great, fast, nice and consistent. split our check, no prob, knew answers to questions about what goes in their sauces without having to go to the kitchen and ask, and high tailed it when we realized we had to rush out the door to make our show time. also had our table reserved (really, with a sign and everything) and ready to go when we walked in at our reservation time. (take that, wild thaiger)location - right in the heart of downtown. walking distance to phx symphony hall (which was why we chose it as our pre-show dining spot) and nestled among the businesses so i'm sure is hopping come noon.ambiance - intimate and on the casual side but with nice touches like dark wood accents. i would have preferred the flat screen in the corner playing news be off, along with the volume (it was dinner time, after all, not a rushed business lunch) and some music instead, but it was only a mild annoyance.food - i loved my yellow curry. it was sweet and savory and spicy (not hot spicy, but flavorful spicy) and fresh and delicious. portions were huge, and well priced. i wish i could recall the name of the entree my friend got, but it came out with three - yes, three -- chicken breasts! my leftovers were enough for two more meals. a great menu that would fly with kids and less adventurous diners and with thai food appreciators.misc - hours could be longer. i'm sure it brings in more $$ as a lunch spot, but i would come to dinner more often if they were open later. and they close from like 3 to 5. no full bar - beer and wine only.overall: very pleased, wish i had come over a year ago when i first heard about it. oh wait, i tried twice and was twice thwarted by their hours!While I am no Thai expert, I do eat Thai food a lot, and I can speak a little bit, and I'll be going to Thailand in December, so I think it stands to reason that I know what I'm talking about.Thai Elephant is delicious. Tom Kah with Tofu. Drunken Noodles with Tofu. Drunken Fried Rice with Tofu. Yellow Curry with Tofu. Siamese Basil with Tofu. All amazing.I have been to the Tempe location probably 20 times, and I like it better because 1) I don't have to feed the meter like at this downtown location 2) the facilities are a little nicer 3) its bigger and 4) the service is a little better, but overall this location is pretty good.Cob Coon, Ka for reading!
El Pollo Loco=I learned that chicken is not meat when I visited my first El Pollo Loco recently.  Observe the following exchange:"Can I have two hard taco's with cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans only please""Two chicken crunchy taco's with only cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans?""No, two crunchy taco's with no meat, just cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans please""You don't want meat on the taco's?""Yes, like vegetarian taco's.  Just cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans.""So only cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans?""Yes, no meat, I want cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans only please"*pulls to window, pays for food, pulls away.*swings back to window, hands bag back to employee."Is there a problem?""Yes, these taco's have chicken on them.""I know, we always put chicken on them.""I asked for no meat.""It's only chicken though.""Can I have a refund.""You don't want them?""That is correct, I'll just have a refund please."
Bojangles Famous Chicken'n Biscuits=I was on a grease roll and didn't pretend to be healthy yesterday.I ordered the 3 pieces (I should order 2 next time!) with the dirty rice and a side of warm mouth watering (and melting) biscuit. The biscuit is so much better than something out of KFC but I am sure they used so much more butter! The chicken was crispy and the meat was so moist! The skin was not a thick load of batter like some fried chicken can get and the spice was just right. Till next time, Bojangles!You might not be aware, but Bojangles is based right here in Charlotte and so this location is quite the flagship to introduce this fabulous chicken to people who otherwise might not be able to experience it.This one is located by gate B9 and there is a small seating area nearby. Do your fellow passengers a big favor and PLEASE DO NOT BRING FRIED CHICKEN ON THE PLANE. Sure, it tastes great for you, but the smell carries for miles and miles. So yes, get some of this great stuff. And then eat it in the airport!Okay, enough ranting. I got a simple platter with a breast and a wing plus mashed potatoes and cole slaw. I'm not going to have their mac & cheese in the airport, but at the retail outlets, it's okay. The chicken was quite moist but there was a lot of batter. The fixin's were okay. Nothing specialI can't say that I'm blown away by Bojangles, but it's one of those things that I generally have about once a year.For a laugh, pronounce it "Bo-HANG-glaze".
Pho Ao Sen=Inner Vietnamese woman strikes again!Who knew that a Vietnamese place can have an upscale feel while still being delicious? The Mr and I finally visited this place and both were pretty much blown away by the space and the food, this certainly raises the ante for the already established Vietnamese places. Since we have never been before we ordered our asses off the smallish but well written menu. Started with Egg Rolls, these were top drawer complete with fresh lettuce and mint to wrap and dip into the Nc chm, amazingly delicious, fresh and piping hot against the cool veggies.. seriously, food like this can make you horny! Next up was the Hai nam chicken also known as chicken rice.. outstanding garlic rice with boiled chicken and a ginger dipping sauce. Each bite can be customized with chili and ginger sauce, my mouth is watering just thinking about this dish!! Bò Kho is one of my all time favorite Vietnamese dishes. If you arent familiar its basically a wonderful beef stew with either noodles or french bread. The Pho Ao Sen version is one of the best versions in the valley. You can tell this one is made form scratch, not from a base like other cheater versions around the valley. Each bite was thick and rich with nice pieces of fatty beef and carrot. I only wish they would have added some potato though the egg noodles were just fine by me! Now what is going to a Vietnamese place without ordering Bun Cha Ha Noi? Pho Ao Sen makes one of the most elegant version Ive seen with a compartmentalized plate showing off each component. This plate both brought us to ooo's and ahhh's.. then the fun begins assembling the rice noodles, bbq pork and the various fresh veggies into a lettuce leaf.. each bite was different from the last by using Nc chm, chile, and hoisen sauce. Simple and delicious!!Unfortunately we did not see that they serve wine or beer which would have made this place a perfect destination. However they have a nice selection of different beverages including one of my favorites Thai Tea. Sweetened tea topped with milk while basic is great at putting out the chile fires in your mouth! We also tried something we never had before.. Soda Sa Ht Gà which essentially is Vietnamese style eggnog. Egg yolk, sweetened condensed milk, and club soda make for a refreshing and interesting beverage choice. Come on, go out on a limb and try it!!Pho Ao Sen is fantastically delicious and a new favorite of my inner Vietnamese woman, Ive been missing her greatly of late.
Paradise Garden Buffet=Waited in a long line of people.   This line moves one foot every ten minutes and I'm so hungry.   Service wasn't up to par.   Oooh my gosh!  All these people passing up our long line have silver cards.     These big spenders just fly right in, escorted by a manager.  Then after I git to the register, I find out I coulda went ta the front of the line too. I had a gold card.      Escorts / hostess look for empty tables for us    Plate of Shrimp, a plate of prime rib, a plate of dried up lamb, off I go to pig out.     Our left over dishes were piled high on the table..    Overall....food is average.      They need more cash register booths, so the lines move quicker.  .Buffet of Buffets Marathon - Stop #2 of 7 10:30 AMWe walked from Caesar's Palace to the Flamingo to make it to this stop on the BoB tour.  I was already beginning to feel stuffed from the Caesar's buffet, but charged ahead anyway.  The line here was a little longer than Caesar's, but we were seated promptly and had a nice view of the pool area where the Flamingos & Swans hung out.  I even saw a Black Swan....cool!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=auKWdF71D6A-MqzCJLsY-gThe 1st round we all went to the buffet near the entrance, which had standard breakfast offerings....we were a little disappointed that it was so small.  I grabbed a few Pastries, Eggs, Potatoes, and other stuff.  The food was so/so (2.5 Stars for this section)....then another Yelper Holly C said that there was a Crepe station in another room past the 1st buffet section....what?!  How did I miss that?!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=7yWOGpZ5VrHcpL2YWdcYnQI immediately went to investigate.....yes, there was another huge section of Desserts, a Crepe station, Chocolate Fountain, Donuts, and other goodies.  I ordered a Blueberry Crepe from the nice woman working the station.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=UIQgmkOtmg22t5-_inbfwwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=xbMwXlp78c3N82SeqQxvjwShe was very pleasant and curious about what we were doing with attempting to eat at all 7 Buffets in one day.  She did a good job on the Crepe, which tasted awesome.  The other Desserts in the area were very good (4 Stars for this section).....but it really started to fill me up.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=J0YxypAGNZJLQZA9yc_rVAJust when we thought we saw it all, we discovered that there was a 3rd section of the Buffet!!!  There's a Chinese food section that opens at 11 am....I was done, but a few of the Yelpers I was with went to check it out and said it was very very good.Overall, this was a hidden gem surprise as we had low expectations for this buffet.  I wish I would have paced myself better so I could try the Chinese food....next time.  3 Stars weighted average for the Desserts and 1st section of the Buffet.  Incomplete on the Chinese food for me because I didn't have any.....other Yelpers loved it.Return Factor - 72%It was NOT my decision to come here, I just want to make that clear before I start this review!! I'm going to keep this review relatively short because I don't have anything nice to say about this place. Variety of foods, NOT impressed at all. In fact, it was kind of depressing seeing that this was all they had even though it was lunchtime. The food was so very disappointing and even saying that is an understatement. The desserts were cute, that's one nice thing I have to say BUT I took a big spoonful of one of the desserts, ONE bite and that thing came flying out into a napkin. It  was so disgusting that I actually gagged and sat there for a couple of minutes and tried to keep myself from throwing up.Cost around $16 for lunch, sure it's "cheap" but save your stomach and please choose another buffet to eat at. I knew I should have checked yelp before agreeing to come here!!!A buffet with a view, that's the extent of Paradise Garden. That view is strictly a daytime thing, so it seems a majority of the patrons are here for lunch/brunch. It's a run of the mill Vegas buffet, with some interesting items, but is an overall lackluster experience.First timers here might find the space impressive because it is. There aren't many midstrip lower end properties that will offer a spread like this, let alone with views of a vibrant garden. That's essentially the bread and butter of the experience because the options and quality of the food are subpar enough to have folks second guessing their visit.During the brunch hour, there is a bottomless mimosa option, which is an attractive option for the weekend warriors looking to continue their Saturday hangover. Another thing I didn't expect was the "Asian noodle" station, where one can customize their bowl of noodle soup. I made a killer wonton noodle soup - I'm still shocked. Their crepes station is also a semi-thumbs up, but it really depends on who's making them.The rest of the buffet is a tough to swallow. Literally. Anything fried is instant fail. The pizza is almost always a sure bet for a no-thank-you, most of the seafood is bland city, and if you're shooting for any of the BBQ or Mexican fare, then bless your appetite.Prices aren't backbreaking for a strip property at $24 for dinner and brunch. Other than that it's $15-20 for everything else. If you happen to be rockin the 24 hour pass, then consider passing on the Flamingo version of buffetland.How did I miss reviewing this place for so long?!?  I must be trippin' hard, but I digress.  This buffet is a blessed curse.  There is nothing that truly stands out about the buffet itself outside of sheer volume of choices on the first go around.  Please note that I hate going to a buffet and not having access to filling up my drink myself because I do not like not leaving a tip for the waiter or waitress, but sometimes my cup sits empty for an extended period of time.  Tips should be earned, and not just expected...my personal issue though.When you are first given the clearance to go inside this eatery, and are escorted to your seat by the hostess, you can't help but to notice the massive amount of food that you pass by on the way to your seat.  Once you are given clearance to eat, and given the information that a waiter will be over to take your drink order later, it is just a good idea to just go around and view everything that is offered.  Depending on the meal, you may have an omelet station or a pasta station or whatever!   Truly, there are a lot of options to choose from that ranges from sushi to sliders to carved this and curried that!  A massive salad bar with many options is located next to boiled shrimp and other seafood stuff.  Move over to the next island and you will see sliders, chicken sandwiches and subway sandwiches cut into palm size.  Move to another island and you have a choice of crepes.  Move to another island and you have a huge variety of sweets that includes cotton candy, fondue machines, many cakes and ice cream just to name some yums.  Truly, there is not stand out taste when it comes to this buffet.  Don't look for anything that will knock your taste buds socks off because that is not what this establishment is about.  This food-ship is strictly about shoveling massive amounts of items that you care to indulge into your pie hole often!  Find something that is good for that moment, and just go with that.  Try a little of each variety and leave full.  Just give them a try.  Make sure to ask about any discounts that are available with the buffet as well, which includes them being part of the eat at 6 buffets as often as you would like for 24 hours.Unfortunately this was one of the more terrible experiences I've had at a breakfast buffet in Las Vegas.  There wasn't a wait to get into this one and we were in a hurry.  Unfortunately, we paid the price for that in more ways than one.First, the cost - $25 per person.  Fairly standard, until you realize that they have seating for at least 400 people in the restaurant, which is usually half-filled, and only have one person pouring champagne, one person making omelettes, and then only one place to get hot food like eggs and bacon.So what happens when the place gets full, is that you wait sometimes up to 10 MINUTES IN LINE to get a spoonful of eggs, or a couple pieces of bacon!  Want a refill on champagne? Gotta wait 5 minutes! Clearly the funding for this buffet has been sharply reduced, or it never had much at all.Additionally, we decided to sit by the window next to what looked like a nice pond from a distance.  But when we sat down, it looked like the pond hadn't been cleaned in a very long time and there was a dead turtle floating in it!!!If you are reading this - heed my advice and give this place a miss!  You would be better off going to a Denny's or even McDonald's for that matter!  There is certainly no value here.Well, this is a strange buffet located at the oldest casino and hotel in the Las Vegas strip. Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet delivers some nearly average foods at an affordable prices. As my parents and I were nearly concluded the Vegas trip today, we decided to redeemed the last free buffet for 2 coupon offer after we signed two rewards cards a day ago.As we headed inside, the atmosphere is totally outdated and trippy. The decor, the concept are very 1970s to 1980s feel with the awkward design instead of being contemporary. It's like I'm dining inside Hometown Buffet mixed with Denny's touch.The service is not that bad as I welcome there. Some good; some not so good which they sometimes can't smiled at all. Otherwise, I believe they done a fine job here for making the customers approachable.Now onto the buffet entrees for me. My first plate is a simple lunch meal filled with smoked ham, jambalaya, green beans, baked tilapia, and Spanish rice. So far, it's a mediocre meal. The good ones that I enjoyed is the baked tilapia which it does taste ok to me. Also, the Spanish rice does tasted good too! The downside: the ham is nearly dried and bland after baking which it's left out the flavor. The jambalaya tasted too salty for me! I don't know why the jambalaya adds the ingredients too much! I wish it could reduce it and place natural flavors. The green beans is closely fair to me which I did feel eating it like coming from a frozen food which it did bought at the local supermarket.The second plate, is the BYO omelette. So far, it tasted closely average to me comparing to Hometown Buffet's BYO omelette, yet in a fine way. The omelette toppings that I added are spinach, bacon, and cheese. I wish it needs to make the flavors of the omelette more better, and fresher in my opinion before the doors open.My possible suggestions to improve Flamingo's Paradise Garden buffet is to redesign the concept to make it more contemporary feel instead of keeping the outdated old school formation. Secondary, this place needs to clean and sanitized! I've seen some of the dirty spots there near the dirty dishes collector side like wet towels placing down on the floor plus the seats too. Finally, make the foods fresh and new! I'm sure they need to make it something new instead of keeping the old ways like Hometown Buffet does. This is Vegas Strip Flamingo, and I'm sure they need to change their attitude to step it up.In the end, Flamingo's Paradise Garden buffet is a fairly Vegas buffet that my parents and I were dining this place for the first time. If you're likely and dare to come and dine there, good luck.
Fromagination=6:02 pm.. . tugging on the door handle only to realize that they close at 6pm! Lesson learned and I came back extra early the next day.My co-worker suggested that I come here for some goodies to bring home since this will probably be a rare occasion that I am in Wisconsin.Everyone says this is THE place to go for good Wisconsin cheese and cheeses that you can't find back at home.I ended up buying $20 of cheese that spoiled before I got home.  This was all my fault though. Nick (cutie at the counter) warned me that I should refrigerate the cheese.  Being the Asian that I am .. I figured that that it's like milk...you can keep it 3 days after the "suggested" date.  .  . .Pro:Drunken Goat CheeseA million varieties of cheeseGourmet top rated sandwichesWalking distance from the Capitol and DowntownCons:Still pretty pricey for cheese Cheese curds are not as great as ppl make them sound.If, like me, your goal is to eat your weight in cheese, then Fromagination is your kinda place. Any cheese your heart dreams of can likely be found here, and proudly made with Wisconsin love.In addition to many, many cheeses, they carry all kinds of crackers, jellies, mustards, barbecue sauces from Chicago's own Lillie's Q, Dean & Deluca products, spices, WI beers and wines, utensils and other accoutrements for maximum cheese eating pleasure, and also make sandwiches to go. We bought a ton of cheese and sat and ate our bounty on the lovely steps of the Capitol, which is close by.Fromagination is a cheese lover's paradise!Fromagination is an adorable boutique type shop that's straight out of my cheesiest dreams. The selection of cheese and cheese related items here is fantasmic. So. Much. Cheese. It doesn't just stop there though, they also have a nice selection of cured meats, cheese servingware, candies, dry snacks, jams, beer... and the list goes on. The store is tiny, but there are so many unique and cool things to oggle that you don't want to miss. That being said, it sucks that such a great, unique store lacks so much when it comes to customer service. The workers here give off a pretentious vibe and are very curt. I had a few questions and was looking for something in particular but it was impossible to get the attention of any of the staff. I guess having your back turned to the counter and unwrapping stuff is more important that focusing on customers in the store.I did end up choosing my own cheese and buying it, but the worker who rang me up wasn't very friendly and at that point I didn't feel comfortable trying to ask about anything else. Sorry for giving you my business? You'd think that a store that is so specialized with so much to offer would be more forthcoming with trying to educate customers so that they can really enjoy their products. Guess not. Good selection, but the experience is almost equivalent to going to the grocery store deli and picking out your own cheese. The customer service just doesn't exist here. Heck, the deli guy at the grocer's would probably be more friendly and I'd bet that it's probably cheaper there too.Knowing that our spring break hosts will expect cheese from us, coming from Wisconsin, we turned to this well-known spot for all things fromage. Our original mission was to ask if they had some nice cheese we could, say, bring in our carry on bags, and how long could it sit out in room temperature, but we were quickly derailed by the panoply of other edible and tasteful gifts lining the store. Though relatively smaller in space than I expected, we were able to browse unbothered, until we finally pulled it together to approach the counter. Our man behind the counter had all the answers we could hope for ("the FDA says 4-6 hours, but really any of the cheeses sitting out right now except those in the fresh case could handle the trip, especially in this weather") and was passionate ("really, these need to sit out for 30 minutes before consuming -- it's like wine it needs to decant...but I'm getting off topic"). Our answers satiated, we looked forward to coming back just before our trip to make the purchase, but lingered around a little longer. Suddenly he appeared with a board, no words, just two specially cut samples of cheese. We sampled those. Then we talked about the cheese. Then we looked at some more cheese. He asked if we wanted to try any of the other cheeses. We were indecisive; we are not the cheese experts, we thought, just the tasters. Without another word, he picked up a cheddar block (after I had poo poo'd on cheddar -- bold move) and cut us another two samples. This european cheddar, this was not your orangey, in your face cheddar. I changed my mind about cheddar at first crunch, and we had a short discussion on crystallization. We left with half of what was left of that cheddar and ate the whole thing that night, paired with a bottle of wine from Square Wine Co down the street.
Liliana's Restaurant=You know, I have eaten at Liliana's many times and they have some very good food but I don't know that I've ever had worse service than what my family and I experience last night when we *tried* to enjoy a meal. Notice the emphasis on tried. From the very beginning, the service wasn't great. It took a long time to even get some water, much less some drinks. On top of that, we had to ask 4 times for a children's menu. We never received it and instead got a brief listing of some of the items on the children's menu.After finally getting our drinks, we ordered our meals. Our appetizers came out relatively quickly, as did the children's meal. Then, we waited. And waited. Then we start to notice food coming out to people who came in after us. Not only had we not seen our meals, but we also hadn't been offered drink refills. We asked our server what was going on. The first excuse was "I'm at the whim of the executive chef."   Oh, so the executive chef is determining who gets food and not the order that people ordered?  Interesting. So we wait some more.  More time goes by and we ask about our food again because now we're seeing people who came in 20-30 minutes after us paying their bill and leaving.  This time the server has no excuse or even an estimated timeline and instead offers us some drinks.  I would have even accepted a lie about what happened. And while I understand that people order different items and some things take longer than others, none of us ordered complicated menu items and that doesn't excuse having people sit for almost two hours without having their meal served to them.  Finally, as we approached the two hour mark, we all decided we had had enough and told them we wanted to pay the bill and leave. The server did me the favor of "Drinks and Meals are on them."  Really?   WHAT MEALS?   If my meals are on the house then can I please have them?So, we left and sorry Liliana's but you lost our patronage.I'm conflicted. I enjoyed my meal at Liliana's. The rest of my party was a tad less enthusiastic. But this is my review, right? Right. So it gets a three.The atmosphere of the restaurant is fun! It's classy, yet playfully New Orleans-like. There were cool lights representing street lamps of sorts, which lined the walkway/hallway to more seating that I found cool, plus a fountatin that was adjacent to the table we were at. First impressions: great. As far as food goes....three cheers for the complimentary cornbread! I LOVE cornbread and theirs was served nice and toasty warm with a jalapeno butter and it was all glorious. As I hysterically raved about the cornbread, we ordered calamari (of course) as an appetizer and while fried calamari is not my personal favorite, this dish was polished off by everyone else.For entrees, we ordered:*jambalya of blackened shrimp, andouille sausage, taso ham, nueske's bacon, peppers, tomatoes, onions, rice*pasta liliana - shrimp, andouille, chicken, parpadelle pasta, spicy red pepper cream sauce*pork tenderloin special*scottish salmon, red pepper risotto, julienned squash, balsamic reduction, chive oil*caesar saladThe jambalya was tasty though I feel unworthy of bashing/bolstering this dish as jambalya is uncharted territory for me. Truthfully, I'd say this was only my second experience with jambalya. Soooo I'm far from an expert on the dish. But I did enjoy it. I appreciated how the various ingredients/components worked together and complimented one another.The pasta dish got the thumbs up. The pork tenderloin special, on the other hand, was mediocre. The pork was rather tough and overcooked. And the dish as a whole just had too much going on that it wasn't a cohesive entrée. The flavors were all over the place, not in a good way.The salmon that I ordered as my meal was very tasty. The fish and risotto were both cooked just right and seasoned perfectly. Overall, I'm glad I tried Liliana's....and man am I craving that cornbread right about now.Wow. I had heard of this place, and to be honest, felt that it wasn't "really my bag, baby." I couldn't have been more wrong - Liliana's definitely is my bag, baby! Awesome - just awesome.+ Sat at "Charlie's Bar"+ Excellent - nay, superb - bartenders and staff; very helpful and friendly+ Water glasses kept full throughout entire visit; barely ever hit half empty+ Nice tap list; heavy Abita influence, which is cool by me, Daddio+ Happy hour until 6:00pm; $1 off taps and other specials+ Great little jazzy duo playing songs in the far corner of the bar (Wednesday night)+ Perfect volume; not too loud - just an ideal background sound+ Played until at least 8:30pm - were still playing when I left+ Bartender recommended the crab cakes & the grass-fed, Angus fillet+ With the exception of the seafood, all food is locally sourced within a hundred miles or less+ The crab cakes were excellent - Personally would've preferred a bit more "lumpy" crab; was a bit on the smooth side+ The steak was otherworldly - just beautifully done and supremely tasty+ Ordered medium-rare & it arrived a *perfect* medium rare - YAY!+ Prices were super reasonable+ French press coffee - yes, please+ Wine list/options recognized by Wine Spectator (as of 2013)+ David, the owner and executive chef walked-by, introduced himself, and asked how everything was; I got the impression he is genuinely interested and invested in getting feedback about his business.This place will be on my short-list of go-to venues when I'm on the south side of town. I am angry with myself for not checking them out earlier - as mentioned, I wrongly believed the menu would be heavy on jambalaya and gumbo... wrong, wrong, wrong - it's a diverse menu and the food is perfectly executed. Don't be dumb like I was (ahem, am) - go. Go now.Sad face. Very sad face.I *love* Liliana's - or should I say, "loved." Based on my previous visits, I couldn't have recommended this place any more than I did. But this most recent visit, on Monday, June 9, 2014 left a seriously bad taste with me.- Arrived and requested seats at the bar, where the service has typically been outstanding. Was told the bar "is pretty much closed because of some Chef thing we're doing, I guess." (read that in a disinterested hostess voice)+ Was seated outside on the front patio. -When I inquired as to whether or not it was non-smoking, the hostess said, "Um, I don't really know. I don't see anyone smoking right now, so my guess is not?" + She later confirmed that it was indeed, non-smoking+ Server, Jeff, arrived quickly, introduced himself, and asked about drinks. I was just in the process of checking in via the Yelp app; I set it down, inquired about the Abita taps, and ordered a Jockamo IPA. Friend ordered a Liliana's Hurricane.- Jeff disappeared for 15 minutes, only reappearing to refill the waters and to tell us that the drinks "were almost ready." I asked if we could order cheese curds, as it had been 15 minutes since we sat down. He took the order and disappeared. - A few minutes later, he arrived; my beer had obviously been sitting at the bar for quite some time, as had the Hurricane - both were extremely sweaty. The ice in the hurricane was nearly completely melted. I suspect Jeff had forgotten about our drinks...- Jeff reappeared and took our food order; a catfish po boy and a burger. I asked for a side of the "cheddar grits" as they sounded excellent and were included with a few of the entrees. He assured me assured this was not a problem.- Cheese curds arrived and they were a mess of exploded, over-cooked, overly salty shells of vapid batter, sans any hint of cheese. We opened every single curd with a fork and knife and found zero cheese - it had all been cooked-out while in the fryer. The tempura-style batter was no match for spending too much time in the fryer. - We couldn't find Jeff to flag him down to alert him to the problem. When he did reappear, I asked him to swing by and explained to him the problem with the curds. He said he'd get a new order. My beer was empty at this point, as was my water, but he was gone so quickly, I didn't have a chance to order a refill.- I also feared that the new curds would arrive at exactly the same time as the entrees... and, my fear was confirmed. Out came the curds, followed by the entrees. Before Jeff could turn around to bolt away, I asked for another beer, and also asked for the wifi password. This seemed to confuse Jeff; he wasn't sure if they had wifi. When I showed him the "Liliana's Guest" wifi network, he said he'd be back with the password...+ Burger was superb. Perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned, fresh greens, tasty bleu cheese, and a great bun.- The cheddar grits were anything but grits. They came out in a fried and formed cake-like shape, resembling more of a crab cake than creamy cheddary grits. I cut into the grits and found no semblance of anything grit - it was like a cheesy hash brown. I'm fairly certain grits don't contain chunks of onion and potato.+ Catfish Po Boy was excellent - perfectly cooked catfish, nicely seasoned, tasty slaw, and a hearty, yet not-overwhleming bun. The accompanying side of white bean salad consisted primarily of couscous, pesto, and garlic. Only a few white beans were found.- The second attempt of curds were slightly less blown-out, but they were completely devoid of any "cajun" seasoning (they're sold as Cajun Cheese Curds). Instead, they were terribly salty, greasy, and just not good at all. My friend observed that they tasted like "carnival fair batter" - sweet, and overly salty. - Never saw Jeff again. He didn't bring the password, he didn't follow-up on the meal, and he didn't drop off the check. After sitting for 20 minutes or so, staring helplessly at the restaurant, we got up and went to the bar to grab our check. The table next to us did the same thing; they had a similar service nightmare...$60 for a truly unmemorable meal and an even more forgetful experience (literally). The maddening part was that I saw Chef Dave sitting in the bar, at a long table, surrounded by other chef-types. They were talking about the service industry... as I walked out, the hostess didn't bother to lift her head from her phone - she was busy tapping away on the screen.Ugh. What a polarizing experience... Lovely night at a restaurant that I previously enjoyed beyond compare, with subpar food and truly horrid service. Wow.
Circus Buffet=Had breakfast here. Am I eating at Hometown Buffet? That's the vibe I got.Only buffet I ever ate at in my life where I only went up for food twice. (I'm usually a 4 or 5 round minimum. ask my stomach)Cheap in price, so you get what you pay for.
The Cracked Egg=Met a business associate here for a breakfast meeting the other day.  I rarely come to this Cracked Egg location, but it was convenient at the time.I ordered the Short Stack (2 giant Pankcakes).  They were very good, as usual.  The Cracked Egg rarely disappoints.  This location was very busy when we were here on a Friday morning.  However, the server kept up with the craziness and we were well taken care of.  We also took our time since we were there to discuss business matters....not once were we felt unwelcome because we were taking our time.Overall, great service, great food.Will I return?  You bet.
BLT Burger=i reaallly like the decor here. i love the ceilings! the lights! the servers/busboys shirts"TIP WAITERS NOT COWS".."IF U ARE WHAT U EAT IM FRESH, HOT, & EZ"! i love the grill area everything and some!its located in the back of mirage instead of towards the buffet u go the other way towards cpk and pass the deli. then u hit this small margarita bar & bltburger. hannah s & i shared the vegetable salad w grilled chicken (vegetable salad REALLY now isnt that obvious??) it comes with everything possible i mean its lettuce with radish, water chestnut, carrot, cucumber, celery, so much other stuff but my mine just blanked oops. but too bad the grilled chicken was dry as heck...i mean sooo dryyyyy it was like corkboard. also i didnt like that it automatically came with ceasar dressing blah....and they only had 2 other salads which sounded grossdee got a burger which the other girls tried and they said it was sooooooo tender and delish! too bad hannah & i were sick of burgers after serendipity! their fries are a good portion but for $5...no way whatta rip.o the girls also got this fully loaded lookin potato wedges that looked off the hook to bad i didnt get to try any!quick eat in a nicely decorated restaurant!I could give you a rundown of this whole menu item by item and tell you where to get a better version of it somewhere else in Vegas AND at a better price.  LBS at Red Rock blows this place away in every way possible.  $5 for fries??  Give me a break.This place screwed up my order and still gets five stars. We ordered carry out because we wanted to lounge in the room and not have to deal with the crowds.Their burger was incredible! The meat was smoky, the bacon was bomb and it was so juicy and glorious. Now the downfall was we ordered cheddar and got some kind of weird ass cheese on there. It was a strange phenom to be gagging as youre eating such an incredible burger. Hmm...And we also ordered the waffle fries with the bacon and cheese on top. OUT OF THIS WORLD.Relatively cheap at $5 for about 5 big yummy fries and I nearly wanted a second order they were so awesome.Huge crispy waffle fries covered in loads of cheese, bacon bits, green onion and jalapeno with sour cream to dip them in...if there was better than Fat Girl heaven, this would certainly be it.I didnt think it was that expensive compared to many other places so I definitely, definitely eat there again.after a strenuous day trying to turn nickels into millions at my favorite monopoly slot machines and playing all the hard ways, we ended up at BLT burger at the Mirage where we were staying awhile back.their signature blt burger was pretty good. a gf and i shared the salmon burger and some salad. i guess i was trying to be "healthier" but unfortunately also it didn't hit the spot. actually the cobb salad was decent. but the salmon burger was dry. nothings worse than a dry fish patty. luckily the bf was kind enough to give me some of his burger to wash down the salmon. fries were pretty good. but commenting on food in a casino can be tricky, cuz usually you're either drunk, your tastebuds are killed from all the smoke inhaling oryour brain is half zapped from getting zero sleep!but it all made the stop at Studio B Buffet on the way home all the much better!!!My boyfriend and I came here super late night for grub after a ton of drinking and gambling....only to discover that they had PITCHERS OF STONE IPA. We had been on the hunt at the Mirage for good beer and didn't find any  until the end of the night. We were seated immediately and ordered a pitcher and food. My boyfriend and I decided to take a vacation from being Pescatarians this Thanksgiving so we splurged and shared the Cowboy burger, fried pickles, and some chili cheese fries. The burger was perfect. The beef patty was moist and juicy...just the way I imagined it would be after not having a real burger in YEARS. It was also really neat to eat. The burger held together really well and wasn't falling apart. The chili cheese fries were off the menu and they were wicked good. Don't even get me started on the frickles.Thanking BLT Burger for hitting the spot. We struck GOLD when we found good beer here!!Came here with my grandmother for a late night snack. We ordered the spinach dip which came to us in a hot little bowl but realized the dip was COLD. The waitress was kind enough to send it back to heat up. What we got back, I assume, was our same dip put into a different bowl since it was a smaller amount.I took a bite and it tasted bitter and barely warm. In all honesty the dip was terrible. It tasted like horseradish was put into it and mixed around. I stopped eating but my grandmother ate more.We finished and paid and went up to our room. In the elevator my grandmother said her stomach didn't feel well. Once we got into our room, she ended up vomiting for several munutes!! My stomach felt weird as well but I have a strong stomach. Whatever you do, do NOT order the spinach dip!
Restaurant Les Belles Soeurs=With the proliferation of chic burger joints in the city, I was very happy to discover this unpretentious little gem of a restaurant in a secluded corner of the Plateau. All I needed that cold Saturday evening was a burger and a poutine, and I must say they filled my cravings with flying colours. My burger was well put together, held its shape even towards the end, when usually burgers start to fall apart, and it was daaaahlicious. I can't remember the name of the burger, but it was the one with a strip of bacon in it. The poutine also made my heart sing, for they were crispy in all the right places, sweet in the right degrees and covered in just the right amount of gravy. As for my husband's order, he had a plate of boulettes d'agneau topped with feta and emmenthal cheese. and he loved it. The restaurant atmosphere was also cosy and being away from the hustle and bustle of Mont-Royal Avenue, I felt a bit like in a small town's greasy spoon, which was a sweet feeling. At the end of the meal I said to myself, why haven't I been here earlier?
IKEA=Alright I never thought of reviewing the IKEA cafeteria before.  But my husband and I ran into Audrey W and HER plus one (yes, kind of pathetic we were both at IKEA on a holiday weekend), and she mentioned the cafeteria has not only been reviewed but gets glowing ratings.  You gotta be kidding me.  Yes, the food isn't bad and some of it is actually pretty good.  But usually if you're eating there, you're fed up and in dire need of being fed, which could taint your perspective just a bit.  But the rest of the experience is tolerable at best, nauseating at its worst.Today was a typical experience.  Most of the trays were wet or dirty or both.  I had to go through several glasses to find acceptably clean ones...acceptably clean, not necessarily clean.  The line was backed up so we thought paying cash would be good.  Too bad the guy working did not have change to break a $20 when our bill was $18.30.  Most every table was dirty.  There was no ligonberry drink (the one highlight of this experience in general) to be found.  A small child was spotted running around like a lunatic, only stopping long enough to eat food off of a dirty plate she found in the clean up pile.  Parents?  Anywhere?  Hello?  Unfortunately, I was not in the men's room to witness the horror of a man chasing a naked child through the restroom...naked as in completely naked.  Luckily it was the child and not the man.  And luckily it was not my husband doing the chasing.  At least I don't think it was.So if this is everyone's idea of a 5-star experience, I'm sorry for you or maybe for me for not seeing what everyone else does.  In any case, I've had better, but I'm sure I will be back.
Il Posto=I went to Il Posto last night because I wanted to eat there one more time before I wrote my review. I go there for lunch with the work bunch on occasion. They have a popular lunch special with pizza and salad ($7), but I especially like the goat cheese sandwich. It's a flavored pita folded over marinated veggies and loads (I mean LOADS) of goat cheese! It's called a panini, I think, which threw me the first time because a hot pressed sandwich comes to mind when I hear the word but this one is not hot. Let me tell you: that is NO REASON to skip the burst of flavors this provides!A few weeks ago, I was there to grab a quick drink with a friend. We sat out on the cute patio that is set up to look like a street in Little Italy, U.S.A. These people can pour a drink! I already had a dinner commitment, so I just noshed on the bread and pesto that was provided. The pesto was loaded with parmesan... soo delish! And, the warm bread was better than any I've found in Arizona so far!Last night, I had a crab cake appetizer as my entrée. I got three for $11. Not much filler, but lots of diced veggies like onion, peppers mixed with the crab. I was full by the time I finished and could not have taken another bite! All together, I had two (generous) vodka sodas and the crab cakes (plus more bread and pesto, of course!) for just under $30.I hear from a lot of people in the neighborhood how they miss Our Gang (what this place used to be called) and they lament the old meat sauce or some other menu item that got dropped when they changed the name. Last night, I found out the meat sauce is back! And, Matt, the manager has been very accommodating and open to suggestions every time I've had a minute to pester him about what's going on with the Lounge (the '60 era-Sinatra style venue they plan to open next door).So, now I have my eye on the white pizza and can't wait to go back!I was really impressed with Il Posto, especially after all of the mediocre reviews. My favorite Yelper, Christina P, put together a UYE here last night, and the event could not have been more perfect.The bartender and staff were really friendly and made us feel very welcome. They have a fantastic patio with a fire pit in the middle which made for a perfect happy hour setting.We happened to be there on the night they unveiled their specialty pizza line. I had the pleasure of trying both the margharita and the goat cheese & onion, both of which I thought were fantastic. They also serve bread with a cheesy pesto dipping sauce that was to die for.Our group ending up trying a lot of different pizza's and everyone seemed to really enjoy.I was pleased with their happy hour specials ($2 off specialty pizzas; $1 off appetizers, well drinks, house wines and draft beers) and especially pleased that they extended those specials for our group for the entire time we were there.This is another time I wish we could give 1/2 stars because I would give Il Posto a 4.5... and I will definitely be back to grab another glass of the Chateau Ste. Michelle Riesling and snack on one of those delish speciality pizza's on the patio!I woke up this morning with Il Posto on my mind and garlic on my breath. We've driven past Il Posto many times en route to visiting a friend who lives in the area, but hadn't taken the opportunity to stop in. Last night, that changed. As part of a large group of about 20, I was concerned there would be too much confusion over drinks and food orders. Such was not the case. Our servers were prompt and attentive and were able to remember our names. Amazing! The bread and pesto they start you with is great. Even better was the insane amount of garlic they use. The bruscetta was wonderful. The NY Spinach White Pizza was out of this world!! Our one friend is moving out of this area of town, but we'll be back for Il Posto.I can now say I've been to Il Posto for lunch, dinner, and happy hour.  I love their patio so much that I wouldn't even consider eating inside, even if it was 100 degrees outside.  I'm surprised more hasn't been mentioned about their delish homemade potato chips.  I've been known to skip the salad so that I could fill up on more chips.I'm usually like meat, but went with the margherita pizza last night and I can say I'm impressed.  The bread and pesto sauce were also excellent.With great atmosphere and good food, I'll definitely go back.3 1/2 StarsAlright, I'll try and make this one short and sweet and follow the old expression "If you don't have anything nice to say..." because I really did like parts of Il Posto...Let me start by saying that the staff was incredible!  About 20 or so of us Yelpers gathered yesterday for a Happy Hour organized by the fantastic Christina P and the staffers were very pleased to oblige.Like Bacon B said before me, I'm always nervous about being a part of a large party because it is practically inevitable that they are going to screw up at least some of our orders, and it is guaranteed that mine will always be one of them.  That said this was sooo not the case here.  I was shocked!  We sat outside and were all served at our leisure by 1 bartender who I from here on out will refer to as Superman, because he obviously had some sort of magical powers to serve all 20 of us individually, simultaneously, and screwed up no one's orders mind you...I'll continue to touch on the good.  The patio was great.  Very spacious area with a fire pit in the middle which added some lovely ambiance to the evening, and hey, who doesn't look better by firelight?? Now on to the less than good...The Happy Hour specials were okay, to be honest I'm not thrilled by $1 off of things, I think it's kind of weak.  However, many of Il Posto's drink prices were already fairly low, so the $1 off could sway some.First of all, I will say that their fresh bread and pesto dip which was free mind you was delicious.  The pizza though, not so much...Let me preface this by saying that I am from NYC and I take my pizza very seriously...it is a bit of an art for meI don't want to say too much because I do want to go back and try some different things because the rest of the experience was lovely, but no, unfortunately, I did not enjoy my pizza.  It was undercooked, the dough was unimpressive, and I had to use a knife and fork because it was so soggy.All in all I had a nice time at Il Posto, mainly because of the company, but I would be willing to go back and give it another shot.I joined the crew last night for the HH organized by the fabulous Christina P. Although it was my first visit and I generally like to sample a place a few times before reviewing, there were so many of us there that I felt that I had gotten a pretty well-rounded experience and had enough information to provide input. Phoenix is known for its host of strip mall restaurants, but few can actually transport you to another place. The restaurant interior is a mix of kitschy Italian and moderately nice mainstream. The main patio is actually about the same size as the restaurant interior and is flanked by two cute NYC street scenes (think universal studios city scene) with each window telling a different story and the Statue of Liberty holding court. Very quaint! The back of the patio is taken up by a complete bar. The fire pit that others have mentioned is situated in the middle. The patio is clearly the place to be at this venue!Service was spot on, which was unexpected for such a large group. I have to echo Georgie S., the bartender seemed to single handedly (with the exception of bussing support) kept our brood quenched and fed with no errors. He asked each guests name upon their initial order and remembered them throughout the remainder of the evening. No simple feet, if you consider that we had at least 20 people in our party and he was also serving the numerous other guests that shared our al fresco setting.The manager Matt, came out to thank us for coming by and informed us that there is a separate patio in the back to accommodate private parties/functions. What a divine setting for almost any family or business gathering!In addition to the ambience and service, there is the food... Oddly one of the best things of the evening was the free appetizer provided to each table, which consists of bread and a parmesan/pesto dipping sauce that is so infused with garlic that its sweet fragrance swirls in the air. Now as Bacon B. points out, this will stay with you (i.e.: if you are on a date, you should both eat some) but it is seriously out of this world! I also really enjoyed the bruschetta, which is a classic take on the dish in every aspect except size. More often than not you will receive four or six small slices of toast with some tomatoes and basil carefully assembled on top, but not here... instead you will be served a small flatbread mounded with fresh hand cut tomatoes, chiffonades of basil and more of that dreamy garlic.I was also able to sample two of the new pizza offerings. The Roberto's (ironically offered up by the fabulous Robert M.), which was set off by a sprinkling of pepperocinis offering just a little kick, and the White pizza which had more of those rich garlic undertones. Although I enjoyed the toppings on each of the pizzas, I was left wanting more from the crust. Both were uniform in size and shape and a little on the tough / dense side, which made me wonder if they were not made in house. That said, it was not enough to detract from the overall experience and I will definitely be back in the near future.Il Posto has some really good aspects and it has some so-so aspects.The outside patio area is completely awesome. It's like you're sitting in a little Italian cafe, with one of the walls mocked up to look like the side of an old style European building. There are Christmas lights strung about in different locations, a small bar area, a lil fountain and some other cool decorations. It's worth a trip just to hang out in their decked out patio area, if only to have some drinks.The service was awesome. Our waiter was totally cool, friendly and accommodating. The fresh baked bread and oil with cheese dipping sauce was fantastic. Loved it.They had local beer (Kiltlifter) on tap for only $3 a pint. awesome.The salads and pasta entrees were just ok, which is the reason behind my 3 star rating. I just wasn't wowed by the main course. We'll definitely be back to try them again though, perhaps to sample their highly rated pizzas. I predict a review sequel in my future.For those wondering, the restaurant.com coupons work fine, however the incompetent staff at Il Posto couldn't and/or wouldn't figure out 18% for the included gratuity.The coupon clearly states that it would be included, so no surprise there........but a big WTF when I realized looking at the receipt that they had either purposefully or accidentally calculated exactly 20% as the autogratuity.Now by saying it may have been an accident, I'm really pushing things and trying to be nice because I overall liked the place.I cannot honestly come up with an explanation as to how a person who'd graduated 4th grade math could read a peice of paper saying 18% and then calculate 20%, unless is was blatantly done on purpose with the idea that the customer wasn't going to figure it out.SHAME SHAME SHAMEThe decor here is a mish-mash of old and new, good and bad, nice and ugly.  They've recently done (some) remodeling, since I saw a huge dumpster in the parking lot, but they aren't finished inside.  There are huge areas where exposed surfaces are in need of paint or drywall, and a huge sheet of plastic hung in a doorway behind us, swooshing with every breeze of a server walking by.The outside patio area did indeed look very neato, like a street in italy or new york.  Inside, they have a dining area with warm wood accents, a lit-up fountain, and dim lighting (which i liked, but the mrs said was making her feel woozy) right next to the kitchen area's flourescent light fixtures and flourescent lime green paint.  What classiness the first area had was lost with barely a shift of your glance, since there's no wall or anything separating the two areas.The very uncomfortable booths have hard wood back and a butt cushion that's token at best, with the bottom of the seat being way too long, so your back can't reach the seatback so you are forced to chose between sitting upright with no backrest at all, or slouching so badly that a painful arch is in your middle back.The food had good and bad, as well.  The bread basket with pesto dip was superb, and like many others have said, we should've simply eaten that until full and then left.  The lady's ceviche was a huge portion, and said to be very good (didn't eat it), but the tortillas I did sample were overcooked, looking only slightly dark but tasting burnt.My NY strip pizziaola - after being ordered as "tell the chef to aim for between Medium and Medium Rare" - arrived at barely even MR, but was tasty enough with all that garlicy marinara (*SLICES* of shaved garlic, like in Goodfellas!) that the extra juiciness was okay with me.  I used more of the appetizer bread to soak up the bloodiness.  Mmmmm aus juisThe other had a penne dish with chicken and mushrooms in a brown sauce.  This was said to be all just fine, but my keen eye saw the chicken going untouched and a few peices of penne being pushed around.  Probing proved that all was not just fine, since the chicken was quite dry, and the penne was so barely grasping to reach al dente doneness that she thought at first it might be whole wheat pasta (the dim lighting may have contributed also).Service was 'eh'.  Yes, that's right.  It was so generic, by-the-book, make sure we cover all the requisite phrases and checking in moments -- but nothing more than that -- that I cannot even warrant the "M" to give them the entire 'meh'.  When inquiring if we'd like wine, and asked for Spumante, the server replied, "you mean Spumoni?!? We don't have that."We looked at each other.....I so badly wanted to ask "so, you don't have the wine, or you don't have the ice cream?"....but we both just gave a tentative "okaaaaaaay..."    Chose not to try getting any wine.   8^ |There was nothing too horrible about the service, but nothing great either......EXCEPT of course there was the fact that someone involved in making up the bill decided to _*help themselves*_ to a 20% gratuity when the coupon states that an 18% gratuity is included.Even with the mediocre service, I would have added a personal table tip to the auto-gratuity, but I certainly did not do that once I saw the 20% on the bill.I also chose not to bring it up with the server, because it was obvious that they already knew that it was calculated at 20%, and I wasn't about to play the whole Pretend It Was An Error game.There was no mis-reading the coupon.There was no mistake in the math.It was *calculated* at exactly 20% with intention.So that's what they got from me.  Nothing else....except this review.When we arrived we were told there was a 45 minute wait. I looked around at all the empty tables... Hmm.. So where are all these people and where are they waiting?She points me next door to a really cool and swanky lounge. I couldn't tell if this was an extension of the restaurant or  a separate entity. Either way it was pretty cool. We sat down and ordered a drink, then not 5 minutes later the hostess came in and told us table was ready. Now I can't really complain that our 45 minute wait turned in to a 5 minute wait, but honestly with all the empty tables in the place it felt as if they were trying to turn people away. The starter bread was fresh and the pesto was divine. We ordered the eggplant rollatini to start and were sorely disappointed at the mushy mess placed in front of us. It had the consistency of soggy enchiladas and try as I might I could not find eggplant through all the cheese. I ordered a salad and it was forgotten, I asked for it again after we got our main and it was forgotten. The main was a cavatelli something: Pasta, tomatoes, bell pepper, onion and sausage. It was decent, but I could have made it better myself at home. We also ordered a $32 bottle of Pinot Noir. Now I know that there is a huge mark up on bottles of wine, but please take the AJ's $7.99 price tag off before putting it down in front of me.3 stars for venue alone. The patio absolutely rocks and the new lounge next door is great for after dinner cocktails. The food and service need a little work, but I'll probably come back and try the pizza.Quite possibly the worst steak I have ever been served. I ordered it medium, it came out bloody and I sent it back. After 20 minutes they brought it back and it was charred. It was so chewy and tough I couldn't finish two bites. Horrible. The server was incredibly slow and inattentive. I may have a drink on the patio some day, but I will not eat at this place again.
Krazy Buffet=My girlfriend dragged me here because she wanted to have some all-you-can-eat crab legs.At 7pm the place was packed but we were seated quickly. You do not pay 1st here. Drinks are extra.Well the buffet is really small and all bad asian food. lots of shrimp and fish and some crab legs, a few plates of sushi on plates covered in saran wrap.The dessert bar was a joke-generic cookies and stale bad cake. Fruit and pudding with soft serve ice cream.We were there for an hour-I made 5 trips & not once did they change out any food. The spare ribs looked terrible and everyone noticed because it was busy & nobody ate any. The crab was the winner.Everyone was loading up plates of crab. Myself I'm not into seafood.I see others have given this a positive review because its cheap but thats they only positive thing here. The food is not real impressive but there is all you can eat ice creamcheck here for pics @ http://www.usmenuguide.com/krazybuffetmenupics.htmlDefinitely better than Buffet Asia.  This might be Chinese food heaven for someone that lives in the boonies but it was just alright for me.  They definitely offer a lot for the price and I happily stuffed myself with as many green veggies/meat combos as possible.  All the servers were really friendly and were prompt to refill beverages and take away plates.  3.3389821 stars!!My fella is an Asian buffet food fiend and I try to indulge him from time to time by enduring a meal at Buffet of Asia because I'm a good girlfriend! This morning I decided to indulge him as well as my Yelpyness by trying a new place where he could eat Asian food til her bursts and I'd have the opportunity to check off a bookmark from my list. Win win. We arrived around 11 and the place wasn't too busy. The place is pretty clean and service was really attentive. Refills were quick and plates were cleared away quickly as well. On to the food. The line was kept clean and the food options were plentiful. I was impressed by the amount of veggie options that they had. That is often lacking in buffets. I will probably never be a big fan of buffets, but this is one of the better options in town.This was our first visit and it is about time as my curiosity for the last few years has been going wild every time we pass by and see a packed lot.I used to live just a block from here approximately four years ago when they were building Krazy Buffet. I had moved just prior to their opening and wondered what affect it would have on one of my favorite Chinese restaurants just down the street (Bobo China). I was in the mood for Chinese and we were very hungry, wanting to resolve our lunch and dinner all in one shot.The place is clean, has comfy cushy booths, lots of variety of food to select from and great staff clearing tables and bringing drink refills.The food was good, not bad and not great. The sushi was better than usual buffet sushi which is usually horrid. I enjoyed the stuffed mussels, orange chicken, fried rice, fried shrimp, coconut shrimp, sushi, meatball skewers, pot stickers, cherry bananas and coconut macaroons for dessert.Mmmmm those pork meatball skewers were packed full of flavor with a drizzle of BBQ sauce on them. Yummy. I could sit and just eat a plate of those balls and be satisfied. They have a great salad bar as well which was super fresh and had all of the toppings and dressing you could want.My hubby really enjoyed the super big juicy chicken wings fried to perfection in a delicious light batter.This visit did the trick, we came we ate and we conquered.Their building was built new and looks nice on the outside however the inside of the restaurant was dumpy looking with old booths.
Tommy Bahama Restaurant & Bar - Las Vegas=After filling our tummies with HH food specials from Brio, Tommy Bahama's Tropical Cafe was next on our happy hour tour along Town Square.They offer happy hour daily from 4 pm to 7 pm.They do offer quite a few drinks and food items such as small plate appetizers for $5 and drinks ranging from $3-$7.  (Beer $3, Martinis $7)  We only stuck to the drink menu this time around.I started off with: * Coconut Cloud Martini "Tommy Bahama White Sand Rum, Stoli Vanil vodka, Cruzan Coconut rum, cream of coconut, shaken, strained and sprinkled with toasted coconut." - A smooth drink of coconut goodness that has you transporting to the islands soon!  Their touch of toasted coconut on top really brings the drink together and gives it a nice crunch and aftertaste.  Next up: * Kohala Coladas "Bacardi Superior rum and cream of coconut added to your favorite flavor - Mango, Key Lime and Pina Colada - blended with ice and topped with a dark rum float."  I went with mango for mine and you really can't go wrong with a colada here.  A piece of pineapple and an umbrella tops it off.The Husband isn't usually one for 'fruity' drinks, but the lure of banana and coconut had him downing a few of these babies:* The BBC "Bailey's and Emmet's Irish Cremes, fresh banana and cream of coconut, blended with ice." - What can I say but damn, this is good. It tastes like a coconut and banana smoothie.  At first you can't even taste the alcohol, which of course has you wondering if there's really any in it.  But once you get up, you'll feel it.  There's good stuff in there!It wasn't too busy on a Friday afternoon, compared to the other neighboring restaurants running happy hour.  I think it's because their bar is all inside and you do have a "Tommy Bahama" type crowd if that makes any sense.  Our bartenders were pleasant and drinks arrived quickly, so we had no problems with service here at all.  And there's live music too - someone playing a few cover songs is an added bonus.Overall, Tommy Bahama's is a more laid back place to be when you want to sip some umbrella drinks, feel like you're on vacation, and not get mixed up in the dress to impress crowd.  And plus, their drinks are yummy good and the alcohol definitely sneaks up on you.Where do I start?  There were so many good things about this Tommy Bahama experience that I think I could live there.  They'd probably mind that though, huh?My sis & I shopped at the cute Tommy Bahama store attached to the restaurant and bar before we decided it would be the perfect place for happy hour!  They had a lot of delicious looking specialty drinks but we narrowed our choice to the Blueberry Basil Smash.  And even though it was $12 a drink and we were expecting martini glass cocktails, we were happily surprised when the drinks arrived in pint glasses looking like blueberry mojitos.  :)  We definitely got our moneys worth!  These drinks are the bomb!!!  My sis found the recipe online (http://www.tommybahama.com/TBG/Stores_Restaurants/Drink_of_the_Month.jsp) and then ordered us both mojito muddlers too!  It won't be the same sipping this cocktail without her, but I'll cheers her every time I make it!The menu was filled with yummy food too.  We ordered the Coconut Shrimp and then changed our minds and got the Scallop Sliders.  These had fresh basil and cilantro on them and they were so fresh and flavorful!  I love sliders and they're always made with meat so I don't get to enjoy them.  It was kind of a fantasy to find seafood sliders.  :)The vibe was Carribean and we felt like we were on a tropical vacation with the steel drum and reggae music.  I wish Tommy Bahama had a hotel so I could stay longer.  Definitely worth the trip!The original plan was to do Brio's happy hour but they only had food specials and no discounts on drinks that day.  Might as well just call it apathy hour.  We had never been here so thought we'd finally give it a shot.  Fish tacos were the big standout of the happy hour menu.  These are the kind of tacos you imagine eating while vacationing at a beach resort.  I could've eaten 6 of them.  Ahi tuna was also good.  Judging by other patrons around us, the sliders were the most popular so we'll try that on a future visit.  Drinks were fruity and strong although none were too memorable (cause and effect?).  They also had a guy doing acoustic guitar renditions of songs by the likes of Van Morrison, Coldplay and the Chili Peppers.  I would've requested Stephen Bishop if we had stayed longer.OUTSTANDING VEGGIE BURGER. They make them fresh daily. Packed with beans, rice, corn and spices. It was so delicious I had to write a review ASAP. I think it was $12.99 and included a side of fruit and either a simple salad or cup of soup. Not cheap, but worth every dollar. Everyone knows how hard it is to find a decent veggie burger that's not just a frozen patty.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uUEKndnFbHD8mVkGiirtpA#8M4591pmudsTKD6IhLwd-AThe service was meh. He redeemed himself towards the end, but gosh it was awkward when our server took our food orders and then messed up the drinks. Maybe he had a hangover or a hemorrhoid flare-up. Got me. FYI- If you carry a purse bring a purse hook. The chairs are rounded at the top so you cannot hang your purse. Regretfully I had to put my nice purse on the ground because I didn't want to eat with it on my lap. This was annoying. FYI Take Two- Be careful of the palm tree outside the door. I swear it jumped out and stabbed my boob when no one was looking. Glad it wasn't my eye, but still not the kind of physical relationship I want to have with a palm tree. Like ever.Solid 4 Stars, easy.I have been here a few times for their happy hour in their charming patios by the beautiful central park with a view of the gorgeous fountain pond, and really enjoyed it. This mid-Dec evening, our party of three came for both happy hour AND dinner, and had a wonderful experience! We'll be back!YELPY DETAILS you could SkipOn this cool, mid-Dec evening, our party of 3 came for the happy hour first in its spacious, stylish lounge with a classy bar. Although the bar counter was large, it was more than half full around 5. Our nice hostess placed us at a comfy corner table. We ordered our rounds of red wine (Penfolds Rawson's Retreat Cabernet, $5; BR Cohn Retreat Cab Sauvingnon, $7). Both wines were smooth and tasty. For munchies, we shared several small plates (pull pork quesadilla, 3 per order;  $5; Angus sliders, 2 per order $6; Jerk Chicken Lollipops, $5). All of them were quite flavorful.This evening, they also had a young man (Joe) with a pleasant, mellow voice singing and playing his guiter! We all warmed up to him quickly by his nice performance! - He even took requests from audience, and did an excellent rendition of "On the Road Again"! At dinner time, the hostess led us to our table by the window facing the beautiful park with a gorgeous, gigantic Christmas Tree! Our sweet waitress, Joni, helped us select our entrée: 2 Ribeye with a side of potatoes ($39@), and Crabmeat stuffed shrimps with a side of spinach, $30. The shrimps were crunch, fresh and delicious. The ribeye steak, medium rare was juicy, tender and full of flavor. My ribeye order, cooked to MEDIUM, was a bit too dry, though still tasty - my own mistake for ordering it MEDIUM! The potatoes and spinach were excellent. Over dinner, we were entertained by the view of the beautiful Christmas Tree in the park with its lights changing colors over music, and occasionally peppered by falling (faux) snow flakes! What a wonderful holiday treat it was!We were too stuffed to try their tempting deserts, but did enjoy a hot cup of coffee for good measure. The attentive service of Joni and her wait crew, and the tasty dishes...made our dinner another memorable experience! We'll be back for more, perhaps, even sample their deserts! Dec 2013
Temptations Cafe=I came here for lunch with a colleague on Friday and I wasn't super impressed but if you're hungry, it will get the job done!  You can tell that it is a locally owned, family run business and the staff was extremely personable. They get 5 stars!  I got the parmesan chicken salad sandwich and it was good, not great. It was served warm with chicken salad and cheese only. It was very basic. The salad was also super basic and the Italian dressing tasted like Wish-Bone from the grocery store. My colleague got the turkey club and it looked good! I wished that I ordered it when the food came. His looked much better than mine! There aren't many restaurants near them so i'm sure they get business from the nearby corporations!
Rotisserie St Hubert=Cold, wet and exhausted Krista M and I realized we were in front of this St Cat's St Hubert. This is like a classy St Hubert with a hostess and nice big windows, but really you're getting what you always get. Medium caliber rotisserie chicken, ribs, deep fried cheese bites and things like that. But the truth is, a pitcher of beer and some roasty and greasy things are sometimes exactly what you need and this joint on this particular night definitely did not disappoint.
Paradise Bakery & Cafe=Hurray for a little piece of paradise... thanks  to Paradise for honoring my 3 year old free sandwich coupon  and giving me my scrambled egg breakfast for free. You get mucho points for class in my book! Glad your in Norterra , you are an oasis !I assume all of the PB&C all mostly the same but the few times I have been here it has always been nice. The staff is friendly and helpful, the store is clean. I had an Asaigo bagel with egg and bacon. Apple wood smoked bacon as they tout. The bagel was kick ass, smushed with a panni grill. The egg and cheese were good. The bacon was small rubber strips of ?bacon?...The prices are a little high but this is supposed to be more high end then Mcdonalds right?
Wingstop=I placed an online order on 1-22-11 at approximately 8:45PM and was assigned a pick up time of 9:16PM. I arrived at the location and was told that my order had not been started because the employees forgot to check the fax for an online order. There was another customer there who called in her order, arrived 30 minutes after the call and they still had not started preparing her food and she was being ignored as well. It was not busy, when I arrived, the manager was leaning against a broom talking on her cell phone. The employees were just milling around and no food was being prepared. Additionally there were only 3 tables of customers who were all eating, thus no reason why food should be delayed.  Once I realized it would be another 30 minutes before they could even get to my order I asked for a refund and was refused. I asked 2 additional times for a refund and was refused again by the manager (who is the owner's wife). She did not speak English (per her employees) and because I am African American assumed that I didn't speak Spanish. She proceeded to use racist and derogatory language regarding me and my request to her employees and in ear shot of the restaurant patrons. She referred to me using the slang for whore, fat pig, and the Spanish slang for the N----- word. I continued to request a refund at which time she called the owner Jose Arriola who informed me that I was not getting a refund nor was I getting my food order and even if I called GOD it wouldn't help the situation.I repeated my request for a refund while repeating back his statements for clarification. While I was speaking Jose ended the call by hanging up in my face. Once he ended the call, I asked the female manager? again for a refund. By this time I have been in the restaurant for over 40 minutes. I was told by an employee that Jose was on his way to speak to me in person and to resolve the matter. Within 5 minutes Jose arrived and started a conversation with a friend of his for an additional 30 minutes. I was told in confidence by one of the employees that he was stalling on purpose in hopes that I would either leave without my money or food, or I would cause a scene which would give him reason to call the police.I remained calm and continued to ask at 2 minute intervals for a refund. Finally Jose came to the counter and stated that I would get a refund via online and that he cannot and will not issue a refund in person. I requested something in writing that he agrees to process a refund and that the refund would be placed on my credit card by Monday. He provided me with an incomplete sentence on my receipt stating "Refund order because of ASAP" with his signature. My fear is that he is in fact not going to refund my money and will claim that I received my order. At this point I have filed a complaint with the Arizona AG's office and I am contacting my bank tomorrow (thankfully they are open on Sundays) to begin fraud proceedings. Needless to say I am NEVER eating at another Wingstop anywhere in the world and will encourage others to never eat there again. Beware if you go to the Wingstop on Dobson in Mesa, you may not get your food and you DEFINITELY will not get a refund.Typically, I try to avoid wings these days. I'm older, and my body just doesn't react the same as it used to when I was younger.But, tonight was special. It was my dinner break, and they were the closest and most cost effective place to catch the NFL season opener!I walked in, and there was NOBODY there outside of the employees. Being my first time in a Wingstop, I know I had that "deer in the headlights" look on my face. Unfortunately, the young lady working the counter didn't notice that I might need some help, because she was counting down her cash register so she could go home.Now, I'm relatively bright, and I'm extremely literate, so I figured out what I wanted after a little searching...though, I would have been open to suggestions instead of standing there for five minutes trying to decide what sounded the most palatable.I ended up getting the 10 wing bone-in meal with fries and a drink for about $11. I opted for the regular "Hot" flavored wings, though they did have a decent variety from which to choose if you think you have the gastrointestinal fortitude to palate them. Speaking from former decisions with crazily spiced wings, I do NOT recommend anything rated higher than good 'ol "hot".The wings and fries came out as quickly as could be expected. The wings themselves weren't bad. The "hot"was an excellent choice. Not too spicy, not too bland...just right for my liking. The fries, though...they were a different story. There were three different levels of french fries in my basket:1) Just Right2) Uncooked3) Burnt to a CrispOn top of the inconsistency with the fries, they were WAY over salted...almost to the point of not being edible.The only saving grace for this place was the fact that they were airing the inaugural game of the 2012 NFL season. The service was meh, the food was meh, but the circumstances were fantastic. Somehow, that weird gastric/emotional math equals 3 stars.
Four Seasons Sushi Bar & Grill=Who would have known this place has happy hour sushi if it weren't for Yelp? I wouldn't have!It wasn't quite half off, but a good selection of their rolls and nigiri pieces are $1 off at happy hour. I went on a Wednesday at 6 PM and business was doing well. All the tables were full and people around the bar. The prices are reasonable to begin with, most of the basic rolls are about $3.50-$4.50 so $1 off I think is a great deal. The nigiri is obviously cheaper. Great quality too and extremely friendly service. Can't wait to go back.
Crazy Pita Rotisserie & Grill=Crazy Pita is a delightful little restaurant in The District, that serves flavorful Mediterranean food.My bf and I have been there twice now, and I am pleased to say that their food is consistently good.I LOVE Mediterranean cuisine.   Falafel, hummus, lamb...I love it all, but its sometimes hard to find good quality.Friday evening, having a little time to kill, but not enough time to wait at other places, we decided to hit Crazy Pita.I ordered the kefte platter, which is seasoned ground beef deliciousness.  Its served on a bed of veggie couscous, with hummus, and a cucumber and feta salad. Everything was wonderful.My fella ordered the combination platter, and selected the shrimp and lamb skewers.  YUM.  Shrimp was great, and the lamb was SO tender.  Reasonable prices, clean location, and very friendly staff all add to The Crazy Pita's appeal.  Whenever I find myself on this side of town, I would be glad to come back again.I was meeting a friend for lunch in the District.  I've passed this place many times and it was finally time to try it.  Service here was good.  They were very friendly and accommodating.  Orders were taken quickly and food was prepared efficiently.  The dining area is clean and open.  I ordered the lamb pita with fries.  The pita is topped with tomato, cucumber and romaine.  If you want tzatziki for the pita they will put it on the side.  In my mind I was expecting the lamb to be shaved and not chunks.  The lamb was good but the chunks were a little too big.  I'm also not a huge cucumber fan and there was too much of that inside.  The fries were just ok but nothing special.  My friends skewer plate looked amazing and he definitely liked it.  I would return to try that out.
Burger Stop=So apparently if you're reincarnated as a cow you want to be one of the Kobe sort, which is a special breed of Japanese cattle that is given beer daily and a massage so the meat is more tender (thanks Wikipedia!).  All of Burger Stop's meat is Kobe - nice. After reading Joseph A's review of this place my red meat alarm went off and I decided to check it out for myself, and they do a fantastic burger.  Everything is made fresh daily.  So for $12 I got a double patty, fresh cut thin fries, and a soda.  The bun was toasted and slightly crunchy.  Perky avocado and onions.  It was lovely.  I forgot my camera but I'll post a pic next time.  And yeah, the owner/cook does look like George Carlin and although I did not overhear him say any of the 7 words you can't say on television, he'd probably make a good Vegas impersonator.  The one complaint is it takes a little longer than say Fatburger to get your order, a good 15 to 20 mins, but there were a couple of orders in ahead of mine.  And it's worth it when you know its gonna be good.Just a simple easy place to get a nice solid piece of red meat.  Corner of Trop and Eastern.
San Tan Flat=Wow.  I'm surprised by the eager 4 and 5 star reviews of this place.  Flat out, this place scares and horrifies me.  For many reasons.  Mostly because when any number of my in-laws pick a place to go, it's either this place or Serranos (see my other review)... friendly game of Russian Roulette, anyone?The other main reason I hate this place is the fact that I have to shower when I get home.  The whole family congregates in the laundry room and we all strip.  We leave everything piled in the stench of burnt food and smoking wood and we take showers to get rid of it.  There is nothing worse than your pillow the morning after San Tan Flat if you failed to take a shower when you got home.I don't understand the whole stand in line to order thing.  Is it a sit-down restaurant?  Yes.  If you eat inside and can actually get a table.  Is it a "fast-casual" like Pei Wei?  Kinda.  You stand in line, but no one brings you your food.  So really it's fast food?  You place your order and go get it when your number is called?  Yeah.  But it's a steak and it is ANYTHING but fast.  Speed alone (or lack thereof) is reason enough to stay away.  I don't wait for food.  I don't care how good it is, a wait this long is unacceptable.  Oh, but it's not even good, I forgot to mention.  Actually, my husband and my food came out quickly (20 minutes - and we ordered steaks) - everyone else in the extended family ordered burgers - OVER AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTE WAIT -- FOR A BURGER!!!  Did I mention the food's not that good?  And half the menu is very over-priced.  They should stick to the cheap stuff: it is all anyone orders anyway as evidenced by the run on burgers that caused oppressive delays.Then there is the salad bar -  I'm surprised it passes health code.  See those tongs that are laying ON TOP of the lettuce?  You do realize that everyone else in the place has had their greasy little paws on that handle that is in direct contact with the pile of lettuce?  icky poo.And then there are the fire pits.  Has OSHA been here?  Good God, this is such an accident waiting to happen.  It is SO friggin' dark out there, there are all these raging fire pits, kids running everywhere, all these odd obstructions that are 'ambiance' - barrels, wheelbarrows, just waiting to be tripped over.  Did I mention a young woman was taken from this place (some say kidnapped is a better word) and killed?  That's not on the advertisements, is it?Another ugh from me.  What a great concept gone horribly awry.  Queen Creek, how you need some great restaurants.  More power to those of you who love it, but next time the in-laws schedule a get together here, I'm calling in sick.Campfires, Steaks and Country Music...Well, I can do without the country music, but this place DOES set the mood for a 'home on the range' party.  I recently went here with my wife and her siblings and I was shocked.  I didn't know a place like this existed!Basically, it is a few buildings placed in a huge circle.  In the middle is where you eat and have campfires and party it up!  Picnic tables are randomly placed all over, and a huge stage is set in the middle.  This place is open VERY late and is great for groups.What makes this place so great? Fire! No I'm not a pyromaniac, but you go and get wood from a HUGE pile, you start a campfire in their metal ring pits, and then you go buy 'smores kits'... Yeah you heard me.  SMORES!  Smores and a full bar.  Could it get any better? Well, yes. actually. it can.The food here is amazing.  I ordered a huge T-Bone steak and it was delicious.  It comes with salad, bread, and a couple of sides.  It was cooked perfectly and the quality of the meat was outstanding.For originality, rugged location, and beautiful food, I highly recommend this place.Long before I was YELPING (is that really a verb?) I went to this establishment. I must confess that I really did not remember the experience. So with family in town, we decided to try it again. Before going, I read the reviews, I found myself confused with the mixed reviews. But after our experience, I now understand. This restaurant is for Atmosphere only!!! If you want a good dinner or good steak, go somewhere else. Now there are two ways to eat at this establishment: First--- Go to the sit down restaurant portion. Order from menu. Have food delivered like normal. Second-- Sit out at patio yard in back. To get food, you must go to walk up window, order and have food brought out. I am not sure if menu for this is the same for restaurant or not?? Now tonight, the Saturday before Easter we went to dinner. Figuring that it would be busy, we tried to go early, 5:00. But getting there about 30 minutes late, found that the parking lot was already very full and patio area was packed. Still having some lucky family genes, we found a parking spot right in front and were able to get seated at table in restaurant side immediately. 5 minutes later, I don't think we would have been that lucky... So when you see the reviews about parking and long waits, I understand their frustrations. Three of the four ordered Rib Eye steaks. The fourth a Jack Daniels Chicken. It is pretty tough to screw up a chicken breast so can't comment on that. However, the Rib Eye... Not worth the $18 price tag. Very POOR piece of meat and not cooked very well. I was up sold on the mushrooms, which were served on top. This did nothing to cover the poor quality of meat and poor cooking. Now I fancy myself a pretty good cook. I make a mean breakfast, do well on dinners, and do very well on the grill. So anytime I find myself thinking that I can do better at home, I know the food is not very good.... Service was average. Not sure the waitress even gave us her name. And was clearly too busy, with too many tables to provide quality attention. Maybe on a different night when things are not as busy, it might be better. But if the cut of meat is the same quality, I don't care what you do to it, how good your service person is, or how many mushrooms you put on top, it will still taste bad.  It will never be worth the $18 price. Three steak dinners, one chicken dinner one alcoholic drink for each, no dessert... Total bill $118.00 including tip... NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!I am sure the patio atmosphere would be very fun! Fires in pits, roasted marshmallows, and often times live music. So if you are looking for fun place to go with friends to enjoy an evening under stars, this might be the place. Want a good steak or other type meal... Go somewhere else...The Background:I live about 800ft from your establishment. I have visited with friends and family monthly (maybe even weekly) for the last 2 1/2 years. We are a family of 3 and generally meet 2 extra for dinner, 95% of the time we are a party of 5. Last time we visited we ordered a FULL rack of ribs, 2 filet steaks, 1 burger and 1 JD Chicken, plus side salads and drinks. I tipped my server over 30% (you can ask her) and I recommend you to everybody I know. Sometimes we are squished on a table for 4 and sometimes we are sat on a bigger table, I'm not bothered either way, it isn't Nobu, it's STF.This Evening's Visit:I arrived at 7pm and asked the hostess for a table for 6, she told me she would seat me once my other guests arrived and there was no wait. They were parking their car but once they arrived turned out there were only 4, making us a group of 5. The hostess then proceeded to tell me that we could no longer have one of the tables for 6 as we were only 5 so we would have to wait 45 minutes. I told her that we would squeeze onto a table of 4 and it was ok. I am unsure of how to describe what happened next, she told me that she was unable to seat us on a 4 table because they are for 4 people and she was unable to seat us on a 6 table as we were only 5 people and she was adamant we would have to wait 45 minutes to be seated. Confused? Yes I was too. At this point one of the lovely servers came over and said that we could squeeze onto a booth on her side, the hostess said no. I understand you have limited space but you weren't even busy!My Questions:I guess what I would like to know is do you cater to parties of 5? Is your seating arrangement simply about money? Is there any reason you will not seat 5 people on a table for 4 and is there any reason you will not seat 5 people on a table for 6 or more. I saw couples sat alone on tables for 4, tell me then how that makes sense, there are 2 wasted seats. Is this a new policy? Do you have a new manager? Is it policy to make customers feel uncomfortable and stupid? Is there a reason you have employed an arrogant young girl who is unable to crack a smile? The dining room had 6 fully cleared empty tables (2 tables for 4 and 2 tables for 6+) why couldn't I have one?Conclusion:So it's New Years Eve and I left almost in tears, I felt embarrassed having to do that in front of guests who had flown in from CT, and I felt upset that one of my favorite places has now started with this new attitude. When we left you still had a total of 6 empty tables and because of the mood of your 'hostess' you lost about $200. We went to Gordon Biersch, and luckily were able to save the evening, ironically sat on a table for 6. Our guests were disgusted and asked if that's how things happened in AZ. I have NEVER in all my years of traveling and eating out been made to feel so unwelcome. I am truly disgusted. I am so polite, never make demands, never make a fuss an am still sat here hours later scratching my head wondering what the hell that was all about. You should be honored that people choose STF as a place to spend their New Year and maybe think twice about placing an arrogant young girl as a hostess who is unable to solve even a simple problem.Dan P. wrote a very well thought out review that I agreed with upon my visit. So instead of just reiterating everything he said, I thought I would share it..."I ate here last night and I've never been to a place that has so much potential to be a destination restaurant only to have itself shoot itself in the foot. The owner has to be blind to not see what growth could come and business to be made if he just made a few minor changes.The atmosphere is unique and unlike anything out there. Roast your own s'mores for dessert? Hell ya! The live country music goes right in with the motif and the buildings surrounding you, damn, I felt right in my own wagon circle on the plains! Though I must admit, I don't think the cowboys nailed random revolutionary quotes and bill of rights amendments to every fixture they had. I came last night for a western experience, not to be lectured everywhere I looked like I was in high school history class.Sadly, everything else is so poorly thought out that the charm washes right off you. You stand in line for an hour just to ORDER the food, you still get asked for a tip even though there are no servers, 20 mins to wait for the food to get ready and you are prompted by a very not cowboy deli counter display, only to have you put your own toppings on. Shoot, for the $40 I paid, I could do that at fuddruckers and NOT pay a tip. I will say the burger was a good size and tasted on point, so there was a saving grace, but c'mon. No one wants to stand around waiting that long just to ORDER. I'd have rather had the typical sit down experience. Which, by the way, you are lucky to do if you aren't smart enough to have someone in your party save a table in the first place.If the owner reads this, here's a nickel worth of advice that will be a golden goose, I promise. Move the meat grilling outside, have at least five guys work the station, charge adults a flat $25, and make all of the sides buffet. What could be more western authentic than taking a giant spoon of baked beans and plopping it on your plate next to your ribs? Have fresh corn on the cob, potato salad, onion rings and fries and to top it off, a pot of chili which simmers all day. You have the right idea with the fires, now build on it and make the experience fully immersive! Then I don't care how much I paid for the food, I'd be having too much fun with the food!!!Sadly, I'm giving out my first two star review, not that it was terrible, but this place has too much potential to be something so so much more. At that's a damn shame. In fact, you guys might have just given me an idea worth investing in and I'll bet you I can pull it off with twice the profit. If you feel compelled to come here, go I guess, but I think you'll feel the same way: looks are one thing but execution will always win out."Just happened to be working in the area and needed something that I could eat in a hurry. This review is based on a lunchtime experience and does not reflect getting hammered and enjoying some live country music.This in one of those places where you go and get yourself a beer (several) and kick back while soaking up some really fun cowboy type atmosphere. The whole place is decorated with a nifty western theme and you will notice it in a heart beat.Came here for lunch and had to order at the bar. The usual ordering window was closed and there was no real servers for the tables. That's OK. The bartender was pretty cute and she kept me on my toes.Order a Mesquite Chicken sandwich that came with fries ($10). You can dress it up at the small condiment bar since it basically arrives naked. The sandwich was good but lacked enough chicken to completely cover the bun. The smokey mesquite flavor was probably the best part of the meal.This is what I call a cool tourist trap for those who really like the cowboy experience. There is a nice outdoor eating area with a large stage for live country bands. I'm assuming that they play during the nights and weekends?Give them a visit when you can't resist open air eating with a menu that is pretty basic to say the least. I do love music and can play a pretty good guitar myself. Unfortunately there was no music during my chow down and I couldn't drink any beers before going back to work. MORE COWBELL PLEASE!3 STARS
Dickey's Barbecue Pit=I have now been to both of the places named Dickeys in the greater Phoenix area.One, Dickies Dogs out in North Scottsdale would occasionally get my retox business, when we lived out that way...they were close to DC Ranch and close to the DC Ranch Village, so it made getting a hot dog easy enough:)Then people started throwing dynamite through the windows of Dickies Dogs in the middle of the night in a misguided attempt at extreme restaurant critiquing:)I quit going to Dickies Dogs when the possibility of getting fragged reared its ugly head!I'm thinking the guerilla critic might have been guilty of a case of mistaken identity (as well as multiple Class A federal felonies:(While Dickies Dogs made serviceable hot dogs, you really can't say the same about the "barbecue" from Dickeys Pit.I met a friend at Dickeys Pit yesterday for lunch and a business meeting...from the moment I walked in, I just sort of knew it was not going to go well for Dickeys Pit:(I took a look at the somewhat limited menu, while I sniffed in vain for the slightest hint of wood smoke in the air.Then I read their menu more closely.When they talk about how they make their "barbecue" at Dickeys, they talk about how they "cook" their meats "on the pit" overnight...wait a minute...that's not barbecue!I walked around to the side of the counter and saw the stainless steel "pit", over which they "cook" the meat...oh crap?!?!?At any rate, I was there and I was starving (power yoga and no breakfast make for an empty boy:) so I went ahead and ordered the pulled pork sandwich with "barbecue" beans.They brought out my sandwich, which had been "cooked on the pit"...sliced pork shoulder (not pulled pork) without so much as a hint of smoke, served with watery beans that had more in common with bean soup than with real barbecue beans...except without the flavor of good bean soup:(They have serve yourself barbecue sauce and I got regular and spicy sauce (the sweet sauce was almost like candy:(...and I slathered the spicy on my sandwich in an unsuccessful effort to get some flavor into the meat.It was just a sliced pork sandwich with second rate barbecue sauce poured over the top...it wasn't barbecue, pit or otherwise and it wasn't good:(The place is clean, modern, family friendly, pretty cheap and completely without redeeming value when it comes to the food they serve.I think the mysterious Mad Dickies Bomber might just have had the wrong Dickeys!Was getting my car washed next door and wanted to grab a bite to eat.  Since I love BBQ, this was an easy decision for me to give this place a shot.  After browsing the menu, I decided to try:4 oz BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich, $4.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z8Em-bhZI3Mmspml7tj6tg?select=Erry3muhVFQdFZQPCJRHzw2 oz Hot Link Sandwich, $3http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z8Em-bhZI3Mmspml7tj6tg?select=qxTdcqqimxhFcmoW1Iyj9gI got them both "dressed", which means they give you Onions & Pickles on the side to put on the Sandwich.Next to the Soda Fountain, there are vats of Hot & Mild BBQ Sauce for self service.  I of course went for the Hot BBQ Sauce.The food is delivered to your table when it's ready.  I went for the Hot Link Sandwich first and didn't put any Hot BBQ Sauce on it so that I could taste the natural Spiciness of the Hot Link.....well, I was disappointed, it's not very hot at all.  Damn, the search for real BBQ Hot Link Sandwiches continues.Next, I went for the BBQ Beef Brisket Sammie.....I poured some Hot BBQ Sauce and added the Onions & Pickles to it.  It's not a bad Sandwich.....pretty good.  I thought the Bread was a bit blah....like grocery store Bread......a nice Italian or French Roll would have been better with it.  The Beef was tender and juicy and had a slightly smoky flavor to it.  I prefer it to have a bit more flavor to it, but like how they serve you the Sandwich dry and allow you to put your own BBQ Sauce on it.The Hot BBQ Sauce was pretty spicy......really enjoyed that a lot.Overall, it was a pretty good experience.Return Factor - 71%
Customshop Handcrafted Food=Customshop is the type of place where you shouldn't get food "to go". The ambiance and service is too good to miss. The space and food quality are reminiscent of a Charleston Maverick restaurant, but more intimate and uniquely Charlotte in the commitment to locally grown fruits, vegetables and meats. Oh, and their WTF meats listed on the menu are actually from Wild Turkey Farms in China Grove, North Carolina, and does not stand for the other WTF you potty mouths were thinking. The cheese plates are lovely, and servers are well-versed in the choices and wine pairings. Try the Blu di Bufala (Water Buffalo) with local honey and Cremont Double Cream (Cow & Goat) cheeses for a pungent spin on typical cheese board offerings.There were several entrées that made the main portion of the meal difficult to choose; however, the house made Potato Gnocchi, Lamb Ragu & Merguez Sausage was ridiculously full of savory win. The Braised Beef Boneless Short Rib was gorgeously tender and flavorful, and nicely complemented by the Kale and Marmalade.Attentive service and intimate upscale digs round off the feel of Customshop, which in its entirety is an experience in which you'll want to paddle around within the lazy river of yum.Customshop is located at 1601 Elizabeth Avenue in a building that is over 100 years old, and amazingly hasn't been torn down and replaced by a big bank building and filled with men wearing blue button downs, as is the usual Charlottean custom.
50's Diner=just like Keith a pointed out here....(bunch of oldie pics/album covers plastered on the wall but all tables no booths )but to me it is a BIGGIE it is killing this place...no boothes no jukebox -thats what makes a diner a 50's diner, right??I came at 9 am on a Saturday and it was DEAD-2 other diners scattered in the very small open dining room of tables.The help was very friendly and fast, the food was terrific especially the spuds. The french toast was great, and so were the pancakes.We really enjoyed looking for Waldo in the mural of  a small 50's town painted across the entire wall on one side of the place.The whole time I couldn't get over the eery feeling that something had gone terribly wrong here because the place was empty but the food & service was great?? what's up with that?? did I miss something in the Taste section of the R-J??2nd time around this place is a great little breakfast spot. Never too crowded, very friendly service and great low cost food.They have like 35+ omelettes and lots of under $5 breakfast choices.Still missing the uniforms,jukebox and boothes but the food is the real deal.
Teharu Sushi=I had so much fun here! Little food goes around in circles in front of you and no matter how much shit you grab, your bill ends up being like $8.  Okay that was an exaggeration. Maybe $12. I can see how the strongest arguments for a place like this would be price and convenience.  I'm an asshole so I look at it as a type of "Competitive Eating" environment where we are all racing to see who can make the highest plate tower. I realize I'm given a substantial advantage being as I'm the only who even knows the contest is going on, but it's still a challenge. What can I say? I enjoy challenging myself. It says so on my resume. But I digress.The food is okay. The nigiri is thin, but it's also $1 for two pieces, so I'm not going to complain. The rolls are basic but tasty. You only get 4 pieces on the plate, which is good for just one or two people because you can try stuff without committing to a whole roll. It's basically Sushi for Beginners rolling around on the conveyor belt and though I hear that you can special request things I haven't tried to do so yet. The highest priced plate is $2 so I'm not even sure something like Uni or Ikura is an option, though it would rock my world up if it was.Another fun thing about the belt is that it's not all sushi! During my visit there were little bags of trail mix, pieces of cheesecake, a can of V8 (wtf?), and little Japanese sodas all circling around, waiting to get picked up. I like this concept and feel it should be expanded to include shots, beers, Yoo-Hoos and those Lik-M-Aid things the ice cream man used to sell. Those things were so good.All in all, the food probably won't blow you away but it's fun and funny and you feel like you put one over on everyone when you eat 10 plates of sushi and your bill is only $13.50 including the can of V8. A-OK!I came here for lunch the other day and I liked it.  I didnt think the food was as zippy and flavorful as it could've been, but it all seemed perfectly fresh.  (And yeah, in case you wondered, my yardstick for a freshnes assesment on a sushi joint is if I had to spend that night curled up in the fetal position on my bathroom floor, white as sheet and drained of all color, weakly clutching a wastebasket and praying for the sweet, blessed release of death.  And the good news is that DEFINITELY didn't happen.)The food was cheap and I really appreciated that part of it as it's getting harder and harder to afford work lunches that consist of something more than a PB&J at my desk.  I think the most expensive item on the rotating sushi belt was about $3 a plate.  The service was friendly and prompt and I have no complaints there.  The only suggestion I'd make is to make sure to have your doors unlocked on the second that you advertise that you are open for business.  I walked up and tried the door at almost 5 minutes past 11:00 and it was still locked and I had to stand there like a fool waiting for someone to come and unlock it and let me in for lunch.  Overall not a big issue, just a minor observation.Anyway, this was a unique experience for a very small outlay of money, and for me that is a recipe for a return visit!  ;-)Went here 08/1/2013 place was shut down by the county and the notice said "Imminent Hazard".it appears they had refrigeration issues but still chose to stay open. Think about that. Sushi with out proper refrigeration? (Vomits). Never again, if you come here after knowing this you deserve a stomach virus.  They obviously don't care.BEWARE OF THE FRAUDULENT PRACTICES OF THIS BUSINESS!!!!I am absolutely FURIOUS! After receiving TERRIBLE service (on a Friday night, nonetheless), which included my server not bringing items that I ordered when the conveyor belt was empty, my friend and I both decided not to tip him because of his terrible service and attitude in response to our requests.Today, my friend checked her online statement for her credit card and found that she had been overcharged $2. I go online to check my statement to find that I had also been overcharged $2. Checking with the 3 other friends who ate with us and decided to tip the server, we were the only 2 who were charged an extra $2 on top of our bill. Furious, I called Teharu, was told that the manager was unavailable and proceeded to begin explaining my situation and was asked if I left a tip. I explained that I hadn't because I had received terrible service. In my opinion, by not leaving a tip I am helping my server to realize that he did a terrible job and he will therefore reevaluate his service and perhaps improve upon it. Being that many people comment on their subpar service that they receive here, the servers must not be tipped very well. Is this the way that Teharu responds? By overcharging customers illegally? When I sign a Merchant's receipt, I am agreeing to pay the amount that I write...NOT any more than that. It's no wonder that their service does not improve...Teharu is illegally making customers tip their servers (I bet we are not the only ones that this has happened to) which causes the servers in turn to have no incentive to improve their customer service.What upset me even more was that the woman on the phone said that there is "no proof" that I had been overcharged unless I bring in my receipt and bank statement, in which case they would refund $2 to my account. Obviously, it's only $2 so I'm not going to go all the way there just to get it back...I'll probably spend more on gas doing that. What infuriates me however is that when I explained that what Teharu did was ILLEGAL and FRAUDULENT, the woman on the phone was absolutely unfazed and did not seem to care about her business' immoral practices. Furthermore, my friend is a very light eater and $2 was nearly 33.3% of her bill. Imagine that - terrible service and a 33.3% tip? This business is absolutely terrible...I refuse to support a business that cheats customers out of their money by means of illegal and fraudulent practices.UPDATE: My friend spoke to the manager, who was apparently on break when I called earlier, and he said that he saw his worker on the phone with me and considered intervening (but didn't). The manager continued to claim that this was a "mistake" and that it happens "often". My friend said that he seemed concerned and wanted to help us by offering to refund us $2. However, we do not care about the money, but rather that this does not affect other people. Therefore, our concern is not about the fact that we were both overcharged, but rather that this business is not taking the necessary actions to ensure that their customers are satisfied and treated with honesty and respect. Being that the manager recognized that this is a problem that arises often, I do not understand why they are not taking this issue more seriously and investigating the source of this problem...if it happens so often, how is it an accident?! We expressed that we do not think that this is an accident in any way and that we will be contacting the police to investigate Teharu's fraudulent business activities. Furthermore, I have already submitted a complaint to the Better Business Bureau.If you have eaten at Teharu and paid via credit card, I highly suggest that you check your bank statement to see if you were overcharged. If you were overcharged, I hope that you will either comment on this post, submit a complaint to the BBB, or call the police directly as I will be contacting them shortly. I do not feel that anyone should sit by and allow a business to conduct themselves in this manner - it is not only wrong, but ILLEGAL and I am determined to put an end to Teharu's fraudulent practices.A last minute decision to come to Teharu Sushi turned out to be an awful one. It being a Sunday evening with a majority of restaurants closing early, we didn't have too many options so we came here.We arrived two hours before closing and the restaurant was empty with the exception of the very few tables occupied. There were 4 sushi chefs working behind the conveyor belt yet none of them welcomed any of us upon walking in.Having been to other rotating sushi locations in So Cal, Teharu sushi has limited options available and their kitchen items menu is pretty non existent. The plates cost between $1-$2. Everything on the belt was basic; California, spicy tuna, tempura shrimp, rainbow and spicy crab. In regards to the taste, the quality was poor as the seafood did not look fresh. Even the rice fell apart upon taking a bite.Service was extremely poor. The server kept forgetting our orders, accidentally dropped our order on the floor and at times had to be approach to ask for items such as more napkins and drink refills. With the manager sitting directly across from our table, she decided to ignore our party while she continued to dine on her meal though it was obvious we were frustrated with the lack of service and disappointment in food. Never would I return to such a place that could careless about the food they serve or paying customers.
Indian Paradise=I always love being pleasantly surprised. I love driving to Scottsdale Airpark for Indian food, expecting nothing special (as to not get my hopes up) and being very pleasantly surprised. Mr. Hottie was coming into town and I had Erin and Ayesha rounded up for dinner at another venue. Well, Mr. Hottie throws me a curve ball by texting me during a layover to state "I'm craving Indian food." I think to myself "Keep cool chica, sure you can find a good spot on last minute's notice!" So I hop on Yelp and try to find a good Indian joint that is NOT located in the East Valley. Yay! Indian Palace pops up on my search. Suh-weet! So I alert my girls of the venue change and off we go! When we arrived at the strip mall location, and walked in, I noticed how big the place was! It reminded me of a big warehouse that was converted into a restaurant. I was also hit with the smell of spices and gravies which was actually impressive because this was on the eve of the complete loss of my sense of smell and taste due to a terrible cold. The menu for dinner was quite large. I chose the Chicken Tikka Masala (my fave) while my dinner partners chose a few other dishes. Everything was delicious and made to order. I ordered my masala medium, while Ayesha ordered hers spicy and it seemed to come out as ordered. The one draw back that I had with this place is that they charge for rice to go with your meal, but we soon got over it and enjoyed our wonderful meal! I returned with Ayesha on a Sunday to try their lunch buffet. It was very good and large! For about 12 bucks, you had a choice of about 10-15 dishes, rice, naan, and a drink (champagne was an option for Sunday). On that day there was a very large birthday party being seated and I think they sat about 30-40 people with more revelers coming in the door. So, the restaurant is no small cafe, for sure! Indian Paradise is the place to go if you don't want to drive to Arizona's "Silicon Valley" (Chandler/Ahwatukee area). Their food is flavorful, and delicious. I look forward to trying them again very soon!We really enjoyed ourselves here last night. From the moment we stepped inside the service was impeccable - you can tell these guys are really serious. The menu is huge with dozens of dishes I have never encountered. Being our first visit we kept things simple with coconut chicken curry. Their hot sauce is wonderful, as is the unleavened bread and the hot carrots they start you out with. I will return. (FYI don't let the yelp picture fool you - the buffet is only available at lunch time)7/25/12Heard great things about Indian Paradise from good Yelp friends, and I thought it was about time I scratched this itch I had for Indian cuisine for many weeks.  I've passed IP many times before, noting it was on Hayden Rd, but never really memorized its location.  Disregard the directions from Navigation android app and follow Yelp directions, instead.  $10.95 gets you all-you-can-eat lunch buffet with fresh garlic naan and a glass of water.  All other beverages will cost extra.  I ordered a mango lassi for $4.  Buffet selections weren't many, but I managed to gather a varied plate http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg?select=d7H3JJ4h89IFRIFY0IA-7w#d7H3JJ4h89IFRIFY0IA-7w that consisted of (clockwise starting with) Tandoori chicken, Palak paneer, Chicken tikka masala, Dal tadka (yellow lentils), Dal makhni (red lentils), Chicken curry,  Paneer tikka masala (curd cheese in masala sauce), some shredded lettuce for texture (not pictured), mango and tamarind chutneys, and finally Gulab jamun for dessert.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg?select=SzJNBzvd9lXjaDhg9DMh7g#SzJNBzvd9lXjaDhg9DMh7g  The mango lassi was gorgeous, and better yet, it tasted fantastic!  Before I had a taste of it, a man who was passing by my table on his way out of the door stopped to ask what it was.  I guess he liked the look of it, as well.  I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loves mango lassis-- great mango flavor, a touch of sweetness, and a definite yogurt tang.  The naan took a long time to arrive, even after I sat down, asked for a lassi, first had a look at the buffet choices, and then proceeded to gather my plate and utensils before lining up to get food.  I had to wait another five minutes, maybe more, before it arrived on my table, which then allowed me to take a good photo to upload and THEN start eating.  The naan was warm, some parts were crispy, some parts were charred, and not very flavorful.  I couldn't detect a garlic flavor at all.  The dals were OK, the red saltier than the yellow, so I preferred the yellow.  I found the palak paneer to be tastier than the paneer tikka masala, which was salty, yet I found the paneer tikka masala's curd cheese cubes to be more tender, therefore more preferable; The cheese cubes in the palak paneer were rubbery.  The chicken curry was very appetizing!  Loved sopping up the sauce with the naan.  Perhaps the blandness of the naan was intentional, to make it a great companion to the sauces...  The tandoori chicken was very, very good, and perhaps the best I've tried anywhere.  Great smoke flavor, tender and moist-- I wouldn't mind ordering this for an entree.  I was already finished with lunch and wanted dessert (gulab jamun, rice pudding, or watermelon slices) when I spotted the chutneys, but I had some naan left, so I thought to try them out.  The mango chutney looked wonderful, and made me wish I had pancakes or crispy waffles to eat it with.  Before trying it with naan, I spooned a little bit into my mouth and found it to be quite salty, so it wouldn't do well for a sweet snack, unless you like sweet and salty (and I do on occasion, but not in mango chutneys).  The tamarind chutney, more syrup than chunky chutney really, was definitely sweeter.  The gulab jamun rounds were tougher than others I've tried; I kept wishing the centers were creamier/silkier.  I liked the sweet milk flavor, although the syrup wasn't scented with rosewater or saffron.  I'd say pass on these last three and save your calories for a lassi!
Sundance Grill=Dry tasteless salmon.  And...we waited 20 minutes for this  fish, without any drinks...because the waitress forgot what we ordered.     Gosh and I  was so starved after the long drive, and this place appeared to look good.   Nice waitress...but she forgot everything everyone ordered several times.  She forgot the drinks and silverwear.  I used the silverware from another table.
Café Santropol=I've been coming here for 24 years now which should tell you right away of how great the sandwiches, soups, milkshakes and salads are.More than once I've brought out of town guests here and they always, without fail, are impressed with the food, the presentation and the atmosphere. The garden in the back is by far the best place to sit during the hot summer months but the seats inside are just as cozy in the winter time. Prices have been steadily going up over the years but the place still somehow manages to rely that hippy-Boho vibe it's always had.  I'm not going to tell you which sandwich to get, my favorite changes constantly over time but you can't go wrong with the traditional flavors. Their originals have some unusual combinations here but they are always quite tasty like the Killer Tomato, Sweet Root and Pepper Island. I know I'm weird in saying this but sometimes it's the basic ingredients in the construction of any one dish is what either makes it or breaks it and in this case , it's the bread. No joke.Once you start coming here, make a mental note of this place. You'l be coming back all the time.
Cal Club Snack Bar=I consider it comfort food.  Quick warm stuff that will make me happy for less than $10.When I got off the plane - I was hungry, I didn't really like the airplane food and was just hungry.  The bus that was taking us dropped us off at the hotel and I dropped my tush down as quickly as I could here as I could smell some warm food.I did get so quickly a hot dog, onion rings and pepsi- I was just happy.Later that week- I was feeling like an upset stomach coming on...so I went there and got a saimin.  Warm broth and good noodles that taste just like noodles from Honolulu.  Needless to say- I felt better.It's not the healthiest food- but it tastes good and to me is comfort food.Nice service and quick.  Really all I wanted just to get me to my next meal.This is located in the California Hotel Casino in Downtown it's downstairs near the craps tables. Here you can get snacks from hot dogs, burgers, saimin, spam musubi's and sushi. It's like a fast food take out thing but there are tables to eat at too. Not the best due to you can get better stuff upstairs at Aloha Specialities. But when hungry and don't wanna wait in lines or crowded restaurants there then this will hold you up for a while.Picked up some dinner to go. We wanted to take food back to the room. Originally I wanted fried saimin but they ran out of noodles! Boo! How do they run out of noodles? The next best choice was the bento box which consists two scoops of rice, Chicken katsu, one piece of fried spam, and beef teriyaki. The chicken Katsu was crunchy. It didn't come with the sauce, so make sure you get the sauce where the condiments are. My daughter even like the chicken Katsu. The beef teriyaki was tender and melted in my mouth. Spam was cooked to a crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. The rice was perfect consistency. It wasn't too soft or mushy. Food was descent. There are a few tables within this small establishment. It wasn't too crowded when we got our food but the line was slow because there's only one cook who takes your order. You basically order and then pay at the end of the line. They even sell the Hawaiian Sun drinks! We had drinks in the room. Food was descent but the teriyaki meat just melted in my mouth. So good. Chicken Katsu was crunchy. I recommend these two items. I wish they didn't run out of noodles. Maybe next time.
Saddle Ranch Chop House=I've never had a worse experience at a restaurant than i had here..even mcdonalds would have been better. we came here as a last resort because the breakfast club was overcrowded, and ive heard they have great mimosa's and bloody marys which was exactly what we were looking for. i tend not to dine in scottsdale at these kind of places because of the overtanned, over-steroided, bejeweled-wearing, snotty environment. first off, there was a long wait - we were offered a free round of drinks on the house because of this...the bartender was new, so when we ordered she neglected to tell us about the different kinds of mimosas and bloody marys they offer...and they are only $2 until 3pm which was a pretty slick deal. try the fallen angel bloody mary, it's made with chipoltle and jalepeno. delicious.while we were waiting, a group of the typical scottsdale bitches and bros walked in and just decided to seat themselves like they owned the fuckin place, while we kindly sat and waited. and don't even get me started on how many dirty looks my girlfriend and i got while we were waiting...ugh.we finally got seated after 30 mins of waiting, and our waitress was very friendly and apologetic about the whole situation. we ordered the breakfast sandwhich and steak and eggs. the food didn''t come out for 45 minutes. forty five fucking minutes! the table of bitches and bros even got served way before us. and the food was COLD, and my bacon was not how i ordered it. my girlfriend had them re-make her dish, which took like 15 minutes and they STILL left off my bacon. we got offered free shots, and had several people come up to us and offer their condolences. what the fuck ever, there is no excuse for shitty service like we received. they ended up comping our food, but we still had to pay for drinks and dessert (the cookie with peanut butter was alright). the main bartender told us he was going to get us another drink on the house, and never came back with it. the manager/owner also claimed he would be back with a card for us, and never came back with that.it was also SO FUCKING LOUD in there (there was a football game) and they had the volume turned up so high i couldnt even hear my girlfriend speak and she was sitting right next to me. i was looking for a cure for my hangover with steak, eggs, and a bloody mary and this place just made it that much worse and ruined my first day of the new year.HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!Yell at me, call me names, beat me up, just PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't make me go back to Saddle Ranch!!  Ick from beginning to end.  I made the mistake of bringing a couple out of town buyers here last night, a Monday mind you, thinking it would be fun and kitchy.  You know, they could watch a couple lushes get on the bull and made fools of themselves and fall off, rustic cowboy atmosphere, good enough for entertaining out of towners anyways.Oh how wrong was I??  Just my luck it was their 1 year anniversary party and the placed was packed.  And packed with the worst kind of people.  It looked like a Real World casting call had thrown up all over the bar.  Skanky, underage girls literally falling over chairs, and being annoyingly in the way all the time.  Oh, and I'm pretty sure that all the steroids ever injected in AZ were in that bar too.  And get this, they were all wearing crystals on their shirts...puke.It took FOREVER to get served at the bar which we obviously didn't stay at long because my clients wanted to get the hell out of there ASAP.The only reason in gets any stars at all is because I cannot entirely turn my back on any place that serves cotton candy.  That would be the 5 year old in me : )(I have not ate at this Saddle Ranch. This review is for SR on weekend nights after 10 pm).You will like Saddle Ranch in Old Town Scottsdale if you are:A creepy middle aged guyA creepy douchebagORAn attention seeking skank of a female who likes to ride mechanical bulls in super short dressesSeeing as how I am none of those, I dislike Saddle Ranch as a bar/late night destination. Plus the bar service sucks and you can get cheaper beer at other places.It was Sunday in America, our nieces had packed up and headed back to their respective parents (fueled by a hypergolic combination of maple syrup and chocolate leftover from Easter...I have no idea how they got their little hands on all that sugar and chocolate) and the Beautiful Carin and I were, once again, free birds!http://tinyurl.com/ca67ffWe decided a celebration was in order...we love our nieces and nephews, make no mistake (in fact, "Auntie Carin" is a family legend...the good kind) but it's always good to rev the kids up and then send them back to their mommies and daddies...kind of a practice session for when we have grandkids.After everyone was gone, we decided a big ol' breakfast/brunchy meal was in order and since I had a Groupon for Saddle Ranch...well, you see where this is headed, don't you?The joint was really jumpin'...I mean for a lazy Sunday in America, it was really going strong...we soon found out why..."Babes on Bulls"...adorable young ladies, in the fullest bloom of babehood were going to be riding the bull, while wearing very little in the way of clothing!Is there a better way to spend a lazy Sunday morning/early afternoon than eating too much, having a few cocktails and watching live softcore?I don't think so, either!Babes on Bulls was a charity event...I have no idea what the charity was, but Carin and I donated, anyway...if only because the name of the event reminded me of the last great cinematic feature I saw...I think the movie was called "Babes on Bob"...there was a little riding going on in that movie, too!A huge and pretty tasty breakfast of steak and eggs, hash browns, biscuits and half a six pack of Devilish Something Bloody Mary's later, I was ready for the showAnd what a nice little show...Babes rode the mechanical Bull...lot's of "yee-haw's"...lots of jiggling...lots of hootin' and hollerin' from the crowd...in short, pretty much exactly what you expect when you walk into SRCH!Sure, there are better breakfasts around...even some within my walking radius...but...SRCH is pretty decent  grub and better than average drinks and service (I mean, these people are always smiling and friendly) and ..."Babes on Bulls"...I mean come on!I'm giving Saddle Ranch three stars because as a restaurant, this is a fun option if you're looking for a casual atmosphere with decent food, but as a bar, it's just ok and good for crazy nights on the town when you're looking for a mechanical bull and strong drinks. Beware of massive food portions! The food comes out on large skillets and many of the meals take up the entire plate. They have great breakfast with everything imaginable, including $1.99 Mimosas. For lunch/dinner, the have salads, wraps, burgers, steaks and more. They serve tasty biscuits and cornbread with every meal and they always seem to add a special treat to the meal whether it's a shot or over-sized martini glass full of cotton candy. The drinks definitely flow here at Saddle Ranch. They have everything from carafs of fruit cocktails to liters of beer. I can handle Saddle Ranch anytime before 10 PM. Before 10 PM, it's a lively restaurant that provides a social atmosphere for some eating and drinking. After 10 PM it turns into a scene straight from a bachelor or bachelorette party. It's the perfect spot if you are a part of either of those parties or looking to pretend like you are, but this isn't the spot you choose for a casual night on the town. This is the bar you choose if you want to throw back shots for hours and ride a mechanical bull while hundreds of people watch.The last two times I've been to Saddle Ranch, it's been disappointing. Both times, my group and I arrived during dinnertime and asked to be seated inside for dinner. When we arrived, the entire restaurant was practically empty and yet both times, they told us that the wait was 45 min- an hour due to "reserved parties." Yet like I said, nobody was there and in the time we were there, I never saw one "reserved party" arrive. While the wait to sit inside was 45 min - an hour, coincidentally enough, they always have seating available on the patio which is where they seated everyone who were walk-ins. Since we were hungry, we ended up sitting out on the patio and the seats inside remained empty for the majority of the time we were there. Do they want people to sit on the patio to make it seem like more people are at Saddle Ranch then really are? Who knows, but when it's that hot it's too to eat outside. I understand that restaurants get crowded, but we've now come to Saddle two times and have been told it's too full to be seated inside both times and we could either wait an hour, leave or sit on the patio in 115 degree weather. Next time I will probably choose another restaurant to visit when it's time to pause the Saturday activities and have a bite to eat in a lively setting. Instead, I'll keep this place on my list when I need a spot for a rowdy night out and I don't need sit-down service.
Sonrisa Grill=We wanted to find a restaurant within Lake of Las Vegas, since that is where our cousins are staying with a 2 month old.  After giving up on finding a 4 star place to eat within the area, Earl made an executive decision to try out Sonrisa.  When we arrived on a Friday at 6:30ish pm, there were not many people at Lake of Las Vegas.  It was very dead.  When we got to the restaurant, there were not many guests there either.  The food was mediocre at best.  I got the avocado rolls, Earl got the...I don't even remember.  It was so unmemorable.  Earl asked the waitress if they make good Michelada.  She said yes with confidence.  When she brought out the michelada, the color was off.  It was no bueno.Summary:  We won't be coming back.
Grazie=Great choice in choosing a spot to open your 3rd location, Grazie!~ DC Ranch can totally use another pizza place on this side of town!When Jared and I decided to go grab some dinner last weekend, we had no idea that Grazie would be so crowded - after all, this place just opened!  Well, word has gotten around, because it was a zoo!  We waited a few minutes for a table... and were both pleased to be seated inside shortly after.  The acoustics in the restaurant were not great.  We couldn't hear each other speaking let alone the music playing amongst all of the chatter.  Aside from that, we had a great meal...I actually met Jared at the Old Town Scottsdale location of Grazie almost 2 years ago, so it kind of holds a special place in my heart.  It's a consistent, laid back, old standby for pizza, salad, wine, and that amazing 'dolce della casa' dessert of theirs.  During this visit, we mixed it up a little and went with an order of the eggplant parm or 'melanzane parmigiana' as they call it; in addition to sharing a large insalata della casa.  I hate to say it, but stick with the pizza... the eggplant breading stood out more than anything in the dish... don't get me wrong, it was good, but the pizza is probably a better choice.  Of course, even though I begged Jared not to order that dessert, he went for it... and sure enough, I have no will power, and I ate my fair share.  I have to say - it's frickin' good too!  Don't ever tell me the nutrition info; i don't want to know it.  The ingredients make me feel guilty enough; it's a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with chocolate hazelnut sauce and banana and topped with vanilla ice cream.  Talk about a splurge!  And of course I took a huge bite just as I was tapped on the shoulder by a friend I hadn't seen in awhile - how embarrassing!  I think i was drooling chocolate at that point!So, all in all - Grazie is great... I am sure I'll be back to this and the Old Town location.  I do have one suggestion other than the acoustics in this place.  Please add protein options as add-ons to the salads!  (IE: grilled chicken, shrimp, salmon, and turkey).  If you had these options, I'd go more often for lunch and not feel like I was completely splurging with every visit!Lastly, if you go to Grazie, make sure to request Kaycee as your server - she's fabulous, and she's a fellow yelper!
Giovanni's Pizza & Pasta=It's the most unfortunate of days when something you love betrays you. I absolutely loved their pizza. Sauce was sweet and delicious. I always recommend them to people looking for a pizza. But today was dooms day. After a long day at work I didn't wanna do anything expect watch the walking dead and cuddle and binge on some pizza and wings. We waited close to an hour for the food to arrive which I didn't mind cause like I said, I loved them. Walking up the steps to my apt a roach crawls up and out of the pizza box. I swear on everything holy. So I call them and tell them and to my surprise they don't even argue it they tell me to come get my money back. So already fuming I drive downtown from south side and get stuck in traffic in the 10st tunnel. When I get there we simply received an "I'm sorry" and a refund. What? Is that really all you had to say? A roach crawled out of my pizza box! Needless to say I'm never eating there again. Traumatized. I took my refund and went to Luke Wholeys and that kicked butt! My review for that soon to come haha.
Chef Chiang=I picked up take out from Chef Chiang yesterday.  $6.95 for the hunan chicken lunch special.  It comes with the entree, white or fried rice, egg drop or hot & sour soup, one crab rangoon, one fried wonton filled with some indistinguishable meat and one thin fried thing filled with cream cheese and possibly something else but I couldn't really taste anything besides cream cheese.The crab rangoon had no discernable crab flavor.  If I had sent it off to a lab they may have found some I suppose.  The entree was soupy.  Very soupy.  The sauce was ok...nothing special.  It was a little spicy.  The veggie assortment in the chicken dish was pretty minimal and the only thing that tasted fresh was a little bok choy.I don't care for egg drop or hot & sour soup so I won't comment on that.  I didn't eat the egg roll.  It looked overdone & greasy.I probably won't go to Chef Chiangs again.  Mediocre at best.
Pink Spot=We stopped in here tonight to grab some kona coffee ice cream draped in hot fudge and there were a few issues, so I'm deducting one star. 1) They had a small acoustic group performing that was 70's wonderful but they were so loud we literally had to scream our orders to the staffer. 2) The staffer was either new, or short bus special, because we had to tell him that the whole point of ordering a sundae was to get the toppings (he didn't offer and I wasn't paying $5.25 for two scoops of ice cream). 3) The previously larger than life scoops have experienced significant shrinkage. They really aren't even normal size scoops anymore. 4) Some how my $5.25 sundae came out to $6.27 after tax. I know AZ is experiencing a budget crisis, but there is no way that taxes have gone up that much, so I must conclude that I was overcharged. 5) The place was so full of Zpizza customers listening to the music that there was literally nowhere to sit, unless we went to the noticeably empty pizza side. The result was not only a complete invasion of my personal space (I simply don't like rubbing up against strangers just to get to the counter unless I'm at a bar) but it also created a really strange odor comprised of pepperoni and sugar... far from appetizing. All in all, the visit was a complete disappointment - but the band was great.How about G Spot baby!? These little ice cream sammies, are not so little actually, and have always hit my G Spot! Get your mind outta the gutter my yelpitas! By G Spot, I mean Goodie Oh So Goodie Spot. And ice cream always hits that spot. The cookies are first rate and the ice cream, while no Marble Slab or Cold Stream Creamery, makes those packaged Nestle Tollhouse numbers at the QT quiver in dairy shame! I've been here a few times an hour or so before closing and they're already swabbing the deck and having the "we're closing in 50 minutes vibe, so go to Safeway and get some Ben and Jerry's"...hate that! And hope my staff doesn't give off that aura. Tonight I had a ZPizza delivered WITH Pink Spot yummies and Mr. Gonzales and I are very happy. And full. So four stars to ice cream sammies DELIVERED in Phoenix. Come on, how cool is that?I am slightly confused as to what this place is.Is it a coffee shop? yes.Is it an ice cream parlor? well..yes.Is it an antechamber for the hair salon upstairs? kinda.Seemingly the Pink Spot *giggle* is trying to be a few things at once, and vaguely succeeding at those goals.I like the Pink Spot *giggle* for a number of reasons:-location-convenience-ambience-selectionIn all honestly it isnt the best coffee shop that the area offers, but It's another option- and that my friends, is a corner stone of capitalism: consumer choice.Now I won't be making the Pink Spot *giggle*, my local haunt, that spot belongs to Lola, and I would never cheat on my beloved tranny. But for those special nights when I get the strange urge for simultaneous brain freeze and a scalded tongue, i'll go down on the Pink Spot...*giggle*
Crust=This could've easily been a four-star review!  Thin-crust pizza lovers- you will love Crust's thin-crust. I ordered a personal-sized bianca ($8.50)- a four-cheese (mozzarella, ricotta, romano, and parmesan) with garlic and marinated tomatoes on a default white dough (Crust offers wheat crust by request!).  Others have mentioned the pizza's phallic appearance- I don't think it does look like one, but I do think it looks ugly.  Almost a turn-off, actually, but once I took a bite of that crust, I was hooked!  I almost went for the special (I was told on the phone that it was an all-day affair) of a slice of pizza, salad, and drink for $6.50, but upon inquiring came to find out that it was only the cheese pizza (Crust's house- mozzarella and house marinara) with a side salad (I was hoping it would be my choice of their salads, as some places do offer this option).  Upon my mention of the special, Mitch (my server who was also the bartender) had the specials board erased.  So much for the info I was given over the phone.  So why three stars and not four?  I had to ask for bread to be brought to the table (slightly sweet with great textures), which isn't a big deal as most places are doing that these days, but it would be nice if it was offered, instead of my asking since I had already barraged the poor guy with so many questions.  I'd asked for the wine list and couldn't find any mention of any wine-by-the-glass offered during happy hour (only beers), so I had to hail Mitch over again to ask about that.  FYI, Crust offers a merlot and a pinot grigio, each $6, during HH.  I was very curious to find out what ingredients were used in the making of their meatballs (for possible allergens), but I decided to save that question for my next visit.  When I asked for a box for the leftovers, the slices were returned to me sitting on a paper plate and placed inside a tented brown paper bag- this wouldn't do as I had other errands to run before returning home, so I asked for a closed container.  Thankfully, Mitch remembered about the to-go pasta rounds.I inquired earlier if the cannoli filling was made with powdered sugar, and Mitch assured me that it wasn't, so I had a mini-cannoli for dessert.  $1.25 will get you one that is about 2.5 inches in length and about an inch in diameter.  The filling's a little sweeter than other cannolis I've had, but still very good!  I really liked the shell- crunchy, light and flaky, without a greasy aftertaste!  (No grease on the fingers, either!)Restroom was clean and spacious.  The pizzaiolo was friendly and greeted everyone hello and goodbye.  I'll definitely visit again!9/15After ordering take-out from Goldman's Deli, I decided to stop at Crust to try their happy hour (50% off all apps and a few alcoholic beverages, with 50% off glasses of wine).  Even though I arrived 15 minutes before happy hour (4:30p start till 6:30p?), Mike, one of the owners/chefs told me I could order off the menu.  How nice of him!A coworker testified that the filet mignon sliders were pretty good, so I chose the small plate (3 sliders), originally $11, and a glass of Riesling.  While I waited for the sliders to arrive, I devoured the deli sandwich from Goldman's (loved the textures and flavors, but not the price!).  The sliders arrived after about fifteen minutes- not too long for what was to be one of the best sliders I've tasted in recent memory!  Loved the crunchy exterior of the bread, as well as the color.  (I took some home to enjoy at a later date, and I'm happy to say they were just as great re-heated in the toaster oven!)  The filet mignon strips were very tender and juicy, and the accompanying horseradish cream sauce was splendid!  Not a drop of it was left on my plate, this I can assure you  :)  Oh, and what about the au jus?  I only tasted saltwater with a little bit of meat essence.  Pass.  The sliders and cream sauce were flavorful enough to make the au jus unnecessary.You'd think that half a deli sandwich and three steak sliders would've been enough, but rich entrees (and the cream sauce was very creamy and rich) usually make me crave for something sweet, so I went ahead and placed an order of the nutella pizza (same Rustica crust, with nutella, sliced strawberries and banana, and dollops of vanilla bean ice cream), minus the banana.  Please note that there is at least a fifteen-minute wait for this OUTSTANDING hazelnut and chocolate pizza.  Oh my...  I'd come back just to order it again and ravage it all by myself =)10/12Happy 2nd anniversary, Crust!To celebrate Crust's 2nd Ann'y, the entire menu, minus hard liquor, was going for 50% off today!  I decided I'd order my fave Rustica bianca, as well as two other selections I've wanted to try: the Crusted Mac 'n Cheese and the Pasta alla Forno.  The mac 'n cheese is too-die-for!  Love that crust topping and toasted cheeses- count 'em, there's five: fontina, velveeta, romano-pecorino, parmesan, and cheddar?  I'll have to double-check sometime soon ;)  The Pasta alla Forno is also very tasty; the peas lend the dish a sweetness that I like.  Oh, but the mac 'n cheese...  For dessert, I'd ordered the Nutella pizza, but with everything included (I was going to try eating bananas again).  I forgot to stipulate "no powdered sugar," so after the 15-minute wait, I was presented this pretty dessert pie, but I couldn't enjoy it due to all the powder.  It was promptly removed, but I'd have to wait another 40 minutes for a new batch (the resto was packed).  I must've had a pretty sad face on while waiting for my ticket, bec. Mike came out and offered me a complimentary mini-cannoli.  I was still pretty sad about missing out on all of that Nutella goodness, but after a couple of cannoli bites, I was once again my happy self :D  BTW, the leftovers warm up well!10/27OK, I've decreed that Crust is my favorite pizza and wine restaurant!  (That is, until a few friends prove to me otherwise that there are better NY-style/thin-crust pizza joints in the valley.)  Not only does Crust offer up super-crispy and flavorful Rustica pizzas ("hand-stretched"), but their 20" thin-crust round pies (I've tried the Little Nicky- white pie w/ fresh spinach and tomatoes) and pasta dishes (crusted mac 'n cheese is delicious both fresh and re-heated) are good, too!I am IN LOVE w/ Crust's filet mignon sliders w/ horseradish cream sauce.  This time the au jus reduction was SUBLIME, and oh so garlicky!  I was told that the "regular" chef was working that day.  To the unnamed chef, I salute you!  :)  The table bread, which you will have to specially request or you won't get any, was great w/ either butter or dunked into the au jus.  MMmm!As if the steak sliders and the decadent cream sauce ($4.50 for 3 pcs, HH menu) weren't enough- I've got to find out where I can get my hands on those buns these sliders are served on!- I went ahead and ordered a pot of brownie sundae ($9.50).  This was my first time ordering the brownie sundae and had not realized it came served in a mini-caulderon-style pot.  Should you decide to order this sweet, make sure you have at least two other tablemates w/ you to share the wealth!  The walnut brownie came w/ sliced bananas, fudge sauce, and a scoop of ice cream and then topped w/ homemade whip cream and a maraschino cherry!  If you're a sundae fan, you'll love this delectable sweet pot!Addendum 10/30:So why not 5 stars?  The atmosphere here isn't as inviting as it could be.  I never minded much about this quality until I spent happy hour with three friends at Cork last night.  (What a beautiful and cozy space Cork has!  Cork review coming soon!)  I'm assuming it's intentional- this being a pizza and wine cafe, the owners want quick turnovers.  Am I right?  Hmm...8/28, 9/11, 10/1, and 10/12Crust is still in my regular rotation, no surprise to some of you, I know... After a few updates, I usually won't add another review unless I try something worth yelping about!  Aug. 28th's Rustica Bianco was definitely a joy to experience!  Or perhaps I'd stayed away too long?  No, this pie really stood apart from the previous Rusticas I've ingested, and I believe it was the added seasoning I detected that I'd never seen before (and didn't see again in the pies that followed).  9/11 was the day Mom and I tried a couple of new items- new to us, that is- the Eggplant parm, which was served in a crust.  I was speechless!  Mom was enjoying her Spinach salad (we ordered it w/ a crust), and didn't care to try the eggplant.  She did, however, tear off a couple of pieces of  the entree's crusty bowl.  This dish is best eaten fresh from the oven, so bring a couple of friends to help you polish it off!  I also learned of the arrival of Nick's (correct me on the supplier's name if I'm wrong, Mitch!) Gelatos on this visit... I was given the green light to sample as many flavors as I'd wanted... I'd enjoyed so many flavors, it was hard to choose one to take back to the table!  We tried a new Rustica variety on 10/1- the Bella Rossa (again, new to us...).  This pizza was absolutely a beauty to behold, and I really enjoyed the wheat crust-- this is the only Rustica variant that is served on wheat.  However, we both found it too salty, which we credited to the presence of olives in the pesto sauce and the sun-dried tomatoes.  Almost docked this review a star, but decided the effort was there, and that wheat crust...  10/12 marked Crust's 3rd ann'y, and I wanted to help Crust celebrate!  Crust's expansion proved to be a smart move, but I couldn't help thinking perhaps Crust should've gone for even more square footage!  The turnout was just unbelievable!  And to mark the special day, I chose two specialy entrees to try: one I'd had my eye on since first visiting Crust a couple of years ago (Sausage, Spinach, and White Beans pasta), and one Mitch is particularly proud of- the Chicken Francese pasta.  We both loved the sausage entree!  I adored the light garlicky sauce, and we both thought the presence of white beans ingenious!  The beans not only enhanced all the other flavors in the dish, but also added a hearty texture that we found very pleasing!  This entree also proved to survive reheating the next day.  Sadly, I've had to give up chicken as a meat option, so it was up to Mom to give me all the details, which I had to wait for until the following night, bec. she'd eaten her fill of Rustica Bianco!  Great news, Mitch-- Mom loved this dish!  The battered and pan-fried chicken cutlets were juicy and paired well w/ the beurre blanc sauce.  No wonder you're a proud Papa!Four dining events marked by new flavors worthy of a Yelp, and a higher rating!An absolutely awesome little spot tucked away in a stripmall which proves that great food can found in the most unassuming of locations!The pizzas are outstanding, most notably the thin crust pies. The sauces are beautifully balanced, the cheeses properly dispersed and the salumis perfectly crisp and juicy. Along with a nice red you cannot go wrong.Our server was also one of the owners and he was incredibly helpful and friendly. I left feeling like we were long lost friends, and I felt like my dollar and patronage really mattered. Find this place and you will find a great dining experience. And eventhough it's small, they take kindly to kids, which us a bonus when my son and I have pizza night.10/24/12Crust celebrated its 5th year anniversary today, and as it has in the past four years, it did so by offering 50% off everything on the menu, dine-in only.  Glasses of wine and and a handful of cocktails were also offered for $5 each.  We celebrated by ordering a Strawberry salad, Meatball sliders http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=skLo5ITLHCYc-7KTQ097pQ#skLo5ITLHCYc-7KTQ097pQ, Filet mignon sliders http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=9NBWbmur1iGAYDRAQyfP6w#9NBWbmur1iGAYDRAQyfP6w, a Rustica Bianca (sub artichokes for the tomatoes, $1.50 extra) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=gBqV2d_OzEapAwM7Ih7EIw#gBqV2d_OzEapAwM7Ih7EIw, two glasses of Mango moscato, and a glass of Hey Mambo, a red blend.  Oh, and an order of Warm chocolate chip cookies and ice cream sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=85Xw1x9f7gzbpLARkjZEhg#85Xw1x9f7gzbpLARkjZEhg.  All were, of course, delightful, although the rustica wasn't as crispy as Mom and I wanted it.  No matter, as I pointed out that we can toast the leftover pizza at home and just enjoy the other items we ordered at the restaurant.  An hour and a half later, our stomachs full, my wallet $72 lighter (which included a $17 tip), and my ears ringing from the deafening noise indoors (my second complaint, which I can overlook on this special date), we left happy and contented.  Thank you, Crust!  Congratulations again to Mitch, Michael, and Duke, and everyone else at Crust, for yet another anniversary milestone, and we hope you have many more!2/19/134.5 stars.Received a text** from Crust alerting that all entrees were $10 each (dine-in only), so I stopped by after work.  Having combed the menu during one of my breaks, I knew I was going to try two new (to me!) pasta dishes, the Ravioli Pesto Cream and Grandma's Pasta, and a half (crustless) Tuscan salad.I was welcomed immediately when I entered and was seated.  My server came by shortly with a glass of water and asked if I'd like to order anything else for dinner, so I asked to try a sample of the week's special red blend before I ordered a full glass.  I've rarely been disappointed with their selections, and sure enough, I liked what I tried and asked for a glass.  I placed my food order, tweaking the Ravioli dish a little by asking that the kitchen sub out the usual chopped fresh tomatoes for artichokes (I'd asked Mitch on the phone earlier if this would be OK, and he said "no problem") and asked if I could have some table bread, as well.Ten minutes passed, and I still hadn't received any bread, nor the small crustless salad I'd ordered, but I was reading while I waited, so I wasn't too worried, although I did ask a passing server to see what was going on.  Around five to ten minutes later, my dishes arrived, and these came with a dinner roll each, so the missing bread was forgotten (although it's always nice to have some extra to enjoy at home).  The salad was still missing, so when my server came by for a check-up, I mentioned it, and he said he'll look into it.  A few minutes later, a full order of a Tuscan salad arrived.  (Because of the mix-up, the salad was on the house- thanks Crust!)The Pesto Ravioli Cream with artichokes was terrific! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=FxAhyaHn1yiexaqxjH5P3w#FxAhyaHn1yiexaqxjH5P3w  When I order creamy dishes, whether it's Italian, or Thai, I like the sauces silky and rich in flavor, and this dish certainly fulfilled my expectations.  The ravioli was cooked al dente (perfetto!), and the tangy artichokes served to cut the buttery richness of the sauce.  I LOVED every bite!  The sauce also went well with the dinner roll.  Squisito!  As for Grandma's Pasta http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=Ip7IWfw0zSUc3hHg8Ni5bQ#Ip7IWfw0zSUc3hHg8Ni5bQ, I can take it, or leave it.  One problem I had with it was that the ricotta was too cold, and I found the clash of hot and cold in this pasta dish a little strange.  I also found that the small chunks of sausage were much tastier than meatballs, and I found myself wishing the dish just contained sausage links, instead of the meatballs, which is a shame, since the meatballs are HUGE!  Last, but not least, the Tuscan salad was delicious!  Loved the peppery arugula, dressed in a housemade Italian vinaigrette, and the white beans, and when I read "homemade croutons," I expected the usual cubed chunks of bread, not the toasted and seasoned slices of bread that adorned the bowl.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=h8xkl7KOxVxNx5r7m86lyg#h8xkl7KOxVxNx5r7m86lyg  I could order this salad as an entree and a glass of white and be happy!With so many dining options to choose from in this valley of the Sun, it's great to know that whenever I do dine at Crust, dinner specials or not, I can always find a great meal and walk out happy and satiated!**To receive Crust specials via SMS, text CRUST to 91944.Though most flock to Crust for the pizza and pasta, sometimes a salad is in order. Gotta eat healthy(ish) every few meals, right?Good news - Crust serves salads as well. Meal-sized portions that could satisfy even zealous appetites like mine. This summer, Crust is serving a kale and apple salad that comes highly recommended. Yes, you heard it here first, I'm actually suggesting that you order a dish with kale as the main attraction.Served with shredded chicken and a dollop of goat cheese on top, this green concoction had just the right leafy:meat ratio. And the bowl was very generous, kept this girl satisfied until dinnertime. My dining companion enjoyed the Greek salad, which comes in its own crusted bread bowl. You can literally eat your way in and out of this salad. Very nice, attentive service and a pretty quick lunch, which is important on a weekday.
Laloux=Laloux is a Montreal institution, and it's evident why as soon as you walk through the door. The service is impeccable - someone greeted us immediately, and the timing throughout the evening was perfect. Our waiter, Guillaume, is clearly a pro who loves what he does, and we had a lovely nerdy conversation about crumbers and the logistics of importing wine.We went for the 2015 edition of Montréal à Table, which was a slightly reduced price for a three course meal including items already on their menu with one special exception - a mousse de foie de volaille that knocked our socks off. The smoky beets with root chips were also incredible and a surprise: I'm so used to every restaurant serving beets the same way, with goat cheese and acid, but these had an earthiness to them which gave them depth. The duck with risotto was very rich and we enjoyed it, but the Arctic char was a bit of a miss, lacking originality. That said, we probably wouldn't have chosen that particular dish had it not been one of the options for the evening's special.Dessert knocked our socks off, but we couldn't even finish it. Absolutely must try their Crémant de Jura if you like to start with a glass of bubbly - we loved it and may order a case of it thanks to our server's wealth of knowledge and advice! (Fellow Yelp-ers, feel free to contact me about ordering cases of crémant to share!)
The Breadfruit & Rum Bar=Dear Breadfruit,  We became acquainted on the internet, like so many relationships these days do, and I must admit that I became fascinated with you quickly. Your menu sang to me with so many tasty words, and your location couldn't be better. We finally met last night, and I am disappointed. While you have a very cheery atmosphere and wonderful staff, your food just didn't woo me at all. The fish was overcooked- burned on the ends,even- and left me unsatisfied. The slaw looked promising, but proved to be nearly impossible to eat. (you try picking up long strings of cabbage and bean sprouts. Just see what happens.) And the breadstick? Oy. The taste of it was fantastic, but it was so overdone that I thought for a second that I might have to send you a dentist's bill if I finished it. My dining companion was enamored with your curry tofu. Sadly, the one bite of his tofu ended up being the highlight of my meal. Sigh. I wish that things had turned out better, Breadfruit, because I really wanted to like you. But, when visiting you leaves me hungry for the hole in the wall Caribbean place on Camelback and 35th Ave, I know that it just isn't going to work out. Good luck to you. PS...did a midget design your bathroom? I had no idea they even made sinks that small.Breadfruit is a cool spot. The interior of the place is well decorated and they can only seat about 15-20 people, making a nice, intimate ambiance. I really appreciate that they serve locally grown organic produce and that their chicken is all natural and raised cage free. Any addition of a Jamaican restaurant down town earns at least three stars in my book. We arrived at 7:30pm and were the only people there throughout almost the entire meal..We brought our own bottle of wine and there was only a $5 corking fee, not to shabby.We started with the plantain and avacado spring rolls, I really liked that wonton was baked and not deep fried, the presentation was nice, the mango chutney was fresh but the rolls themselves lacked flavor. I really wished they would have paired some other fruit or spice to add more contrast to the dish. For my main I got the jerk chicken and I was a little disappointed. Again they did an excellent job with the presentation, but the corn was mushy and what the jerk rub lacked in flavor they tried to make up for in spice.  I like spicy, and can handle a lot of heat, but heat shouldn't overpower flavor...The chef/owner came out and asked us how we enjoyed our meal, and explained his philosophy behind the food. The service was excellent, but in comparison to some other Jamaican places I've been, it really only warrants 3 stars (sorry)!I had the opportunity to visit Breadfruit in the company of a good group of friends who were all willing to share bites of the dishes they ordered. I brought a bottle of champagne to share and it seemed all of my friends brought bottles of liquid treasures themselves! We had so much to drink, that the champagne didn't get opened. With a reasonable corkage fee of 5$ it was easy to bring a ton of wine! For an appetizer we shared the plantain avocado spring rolls. They were so-so. Nothing overly impressive to me. I was actually wishing for a spicy sauce to dip them in. For my entree I had the Brown Stew Chicken dish. It's a marinated and sauteed chicken dish served with rice with peas and some steamed veggies. Again... no spice with the dish. I actually asked for some hot sauce to go with the dish. Despite the lack of heat, It was still very flavorful and I enjoyed it. I would like to give Breadfruit another try. I think their simple menu lends for getting a dish just right and making it well! I look forward to trying their other menu items!I don't intend to return, but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week, my "uncouth" self doesn't exactly feel welcome anyway. However, I'm not quite convinced that it's my loss... It had been almost a year since my original visit to Breadfruit which did not overwhelm (as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back) but I did have an appreciation of the option for Caribbean cuisine. Since a friend and I were going to be downtown for an event, I suggested Breadfruit for our dinner spot. We enjoy good food and supporting local. The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus, as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat! While the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly, 2 for $12.50 -- $6.25 per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book. We also shared the Jerk Chicken Salad ($9.95) and the Jerk Prawns Off the Grill ($14.95). Here's the ultimate rub, the bottom of the menu states "no substitutions or modifications"... Since when is cutting a KFC-side-sized ear of corn a "modification"? At the same time, the menu describes the restaurant and it's offerings as "Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body." It seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it -- particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate it's "beauty" AND after we've communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items -- is in the vein of "nothing fancy." How about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves, then? The fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the KFC-side-sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams "pretentious and grandiose" and tainted our entire experience. To quote my dinning companion, "You are not James Beard and James Beard would've cut the corn!""Rum makes a fine hot drink, a fine cold drink, and is not so bad from the neck of a bottle." So wrote Fortune Magazine in 1933, and it's nice to see we are starting to rediscover this spirit (after the demise of the Tiki scene). In fact, if you really want to motivate yourself to get out to Rum Bar, read "And A Bottle of Rum: A History of the New World in Ten Cocktails" by Wayne Curtis. I highly doubt you will make it through more than 2 chapters before you show up at Rum Bar wanting to try this fantastic spirit. Rum Bar is ideal for your venture into rum because soon they will have 108 rums to offer, ranging in price from $8 to over $120 a glass (with most between $8-15). On top of that, Rum Bar is offering unique and classic rum cocktails (which are going for $6 now, before going up to $8 plus per). We tried a handful of cocktails and each was well-made, even though the bar is still perfecting its recipes. The Estate Mai Tai is very good, and in no way hides the alcohol with overly sweet mixers like some Mai Tais...I consider that a good thing, some may not. The Dark and Stormy, properly made with Goslings, is good, but I think it could use some lime. The Mojito Vanilla is refreshing, without being overly sweet or filled with too much fake flavor. Another nice feature is that Rum Bar offers rum flights, a great way to try a range of rums. The food is right from the pass through to Breadfruit, so you can have some decent Jamaican food with your Rum. The service was very attentive, although a little to "salesy" for me, but then again, they are new and are trying to get their concept out to new customers. The space is small, cozy, and has just the right level of lighting for a drink of rum with your friends, pirates, your sugar supplier, or your copy of And A Bottle of Rum.I rarely go for Jamaican, as there are usually no vegan options except peas & rice.  I was lucky enough to find this place (via Yelp!)  when I was traveling for biz in PHX.  had an awesome lunch.  the menu clearly marks vegan options.  the tropical salad had a lovely tart dressing & the fresh pineapple was a nice touch. the sorrel drink was gingery hibiscus goodness!  but my entree took the cake:  an AMAZING coconut curried tofu.  it actually was seitan-- not tofu-- whatevs.simple, modern ambiance. super friendly & attentive waitstaff.will definitely go back if I make it to Phoenix again!01/27/11Yes, the mango fish rolls http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-breadfruit-phoenix-2?select=kKlpgD3Aa5BpVWDOnaufyg#kKlpgD3Aa5BpVWDOnaufyg were definitely crispy and tasted delicious, and yes, the oven-roasted plantains http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-breadfruit-phoenix-2?select=Q-JPbNWKKO0gMe66G9W2TA#Q-JPbNWKKO0gMe66G9W2TA were firm on the outside and just-like-buttah on the inside, but were they worth $10.50 and $5, plus tax, respectively?  I don't think so.  I took photos of the food w/ a pen next to the plates to show you how small these portions were.  Really, $12 for a small mango fish roll, sliced three-ways?  And I'm supposed to feel good about ordering an entree and dessert after?The Sweet potato pudd'n http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-breadfruit-phoenix-2?select=GhUFceoWCGwSCHxRw8ZMVA#GhUFceoWCGwSCHxRw8ZMVA was just absolutely fabulous, but you won't catch me driving all the way to The Breadfruit to spend my hard-earned money here.  At least I know they've reinvested some of the profits into remodeling the place... it looked fifty times better than when it did on its first year of opening.  If you wish to dine and converse w/ your companions, it's best not to come here on the weekends, when next door Rum Bar is hopping.  Then again, maybe it was just hopping on this night, bec. of the rum-tasting event held there...  I haven't been back since, so I don't know how busy these two businesses are.I can't really review the Rum Bar without reviewing Breadfruit.  They are really one in the same, and Breadfruit's food stole the day. But, to be honest, we have never physically be IN to Breadfruit.  We only go to the Rum Bar and we LOVE this place.  I have been there 3 times. Once when I was a sardine and packed into the place without room to even breathe, once with my parents in the comfy window seating are and once with my husband on a romantic date for 2.  I loved it every time...and by the third time, I was told by my husband "YOU HAVE TO YELP THIS PLACE NOW!" and he then exclaimed "I think this is my favorite food in the entire city."  My husband is not one to stake claim on anything less than spectacular (he is married to ME!)  so here I am giving them the highest rating and review I can muster...The drinks are extremely tasty, unique, clever and strong. I love the rums and the free tastings we have had of the various types of rum.  This place has really opened my mind and expanded my knowledge. I like that the bartenders and staff always ask our names and take an interest in what we are eating, drinking, talking about and liking about life.  They are so kind!But...and yes, there's a but...the Rum Bar experience won't be bringing us back.  It's the FOOD that is the big draw. What a great culinary experience. Every bite is a wonderful adventure. The spices, the mixture of fruits with the savory dishes, the fish...oh the fish!We plan on going back again...and again!  The location is a little tricky to find, but if you found SENS/Turf, it's in the same block (nearly the same building), but just around the corner. Don't despair, just walk south and take a left (east) and you'll see Breadfruit on the left.Wow. I really hated this place. Our server was also the bartender. (I ate there last night 1-30-12.) She was either terribly slow or terribly overworked. Either way-- not my problem. She came to the table and gave us a canned speech about "what she really likes on the menu." Of course, wow, everything she liked numbered amongst "most expensive" on the menu. Big surprise. (If you read other reviews on Yelp, you can read about the pushy service. Just awful.)She talked at us, and not to us. When we were done ordering, she-- in constant sales mode-- pushed the Rice & Peas, which is Jamaican rice and beans. I love rice & peas, so even though I didn't like our pushy server, I ordered anyway. When the food arrived, my companion and I each took a bite of the rice and-- if I would have had a napkin-- I would have spit it out. The flavor could only be described as "odd"-- and it was served room temperature. We both agreed- independently of one another-- that the rice was inedible. Gosh, the way our server upsold us, you would think it would be at least edible. I ordered the soup of the day. I was told it was red snapper with vegetable. It was a fish broth with vegetables. There was no red snapper. So why was "red snapper" included in the title of the soup? I have no idea. So they basically boiled some fish heads, put some veggies in, and made $7.25 profit on a $7.50 soup. I was pissed. Of course, I would have liked to tell our useless server / bartender about this, but she never stopped by to ask us how our meal was-- NOT ONCE. When the food was dropped, we ordered another round of drinks and did not get them until our meal was almost finished. The manager came and cleared our plates, so I told him. He just smiled and basically told me it was my fault for not enjoying the overpriced rice and soup. Plaintains were oven-roasted and tasty. Very stingy portion though.  I would say about half a plaintain per order. These people have their food cost in control baby! Don't serve any food! That's the key.The only thing that was good was my companion's jerk chicken. It was excellent, actually. As far as drinks go, the overpriced Mojito Vanilla was also good. So here's the deal: If you are a hipster foodie who likes the idea of eating overpriced Jamaican food-- even though you and your knit cap has never even been to Jamaica-- with stingy portions, and poor service...this is your place. They missed on every level. Horrible.Wow, wow, wow.  My hubby and I have been wanting to come to Breadfruit for a while.  My hubby has been to Jamaica and all over the Caribbean kiteboarding so he loves the cuisine.  We decided to have early dinner since the sitter came earlier this Saturday.  We didn't have a reservation, but that was no problem since we usually like to sit at the bar and talk to the bartenders.  Tony and Beth were so nice and efficient.  Tony just moved from Portland in  November, so we had a nice conversation with him about the area (we spend summers in OR). I had a mojito, wow, the best mojito I have had in the Valley, probably ever.  My hubby had the Caipirinha.  It was so good.  We thought we would have one appetizer and leave.  So we ordered the Scallops, then the Plantain and Avocado Spring Rolls.  They were so delicious.  The scallops were spicy, it was like fireworks in my mouth, in a good way.  I loved the sweetness of the chutney for my spring rolls.  My hubby wanted the soup of the day, the pumpkin and sweet potato soup.  I ended up eating most of it.  Since I was DD, the hubby had another drink, this time the Kingston Rum Punch, wow, that was strong but tasty.  Tony recommended the Rum Glazed Prawns and Roti Flatbread, double wow.  My hubby had a Pina Colada to wash that down. That was the best PC I've had.  Not the blended coco lopez type.   For dessert we had their bread pudding.  This was the only thing I was not that crazy about, don't get me wrong, I still ate it.  I am just used to the New Orleans type of Bread pudding, more gooey.  The experience at  Rum Bar was so great we can't wait to come back and bring friends.I haven't had many experiences in Jamaican dining but if this is what it always tastes like, then I think I'm adding Jamaican cuisine to my list of likes. Nestled on a side street in Downtown Phoenix, The Breadfruit could just as easily be nestled in a corner of a beach village just waiting for diners to experience an intimate meal. The vibe here is definitely like that of a beach town. Everything is calm, cool and collected. The dining room is tiny and if you plan on coming with more than just one person, I definitely suggest calling ahead. It's cozy, with dim lighting and perfect for a date night. Moving on to the food, those who can't handle a kick of spice to their cuisine should be warned! The menu doesn't lie when it says that the food is spicy. But if you can handle a major kick, the food is worth it. To start, I tried the mussels. I'm not typically a mussel fan but these were an exception. They had a Jamaican kick to them and the servings were generous in size. For my meal, I had the Jerk shrimp and holy moly did they have a jerk of spice to them! The shrimp came with pineapple and this long piece of plantain type bread and I ordered a side of rice. The meal was delicious. Now be warned, the pricing here isn't cheap, however I am not letting that take away from the fact that the food was delicious, the atmosphere was wonderful and the cocktails made of fresh fruit and delicious rum were supreme. I will definitely come back and this time I'll take a cab so I can continue my post dinner cocktailing at RumBar next door.The Breadfruit and Rumbar has been serving downtown Phoenix patrons tasty Jamaican food since 2008, but I finally checked it out for the first time this past weekend. I fell in love with it instantly and can't wait to go back.The Breadfruit and Rumbar is a charming Jamaican eatery with an extensive selection of more than 100 rums. I had one of my new favorite cocktails there, the changing-daily Punch Bowl Special ($9), made with fresh pomegranate and cranberry juices. It was so refreshing, plus pretty strong, and I could have sipped them all night long. And if you're into cigars, you can purchase one there to pair with your rum, too.We started with the Plantain Avocado Spring Rolls ($8.50), paired with a mango chutney. If you like the avocado rolls at Kona Grill, you'll definitely like these. And it's nice to know The Breadfruit locally sources all their menu items, so everything is extremely fresh.I'm usually not a huge tofu fan, but I took the recommendation of our server to order the Coconut Curry Tofu ($11.50). It was a really hearty, delicious dish, and the tofu reminded me of chicken bits -- I really liked it. The rice and beans (they're called "peas" on the menu) was my favorite part of the dish, which also came with veggies and plantains. It was a great variety of foods and really filling. I'd highly recommend it.My boyfriend got the Jerk Chicken ($12), which he said was the best jerk chicken he'd ever had.Besides the tasty food, the atmosphere at The Breadfruit was so pretty. The lounge area was dark and sophisticated -- you won't find any sports televisions -- and the main dining room was small and cozy. Service was excellent, and I'd recommend it as a great date place.There are very few places around downtown to have a drink and cigar, but this is one of them. Stocked by Churchill's cigars; a local cigar shop, Rum Bar has a reasonable selection of about eight or ten cigars and a bar full of rum and a mixologist to go with it. If you're into rum drinks this is also one of the best spots in town to get one.There are definitely a handful of shops in the area you can pick up a cigar, but none of them are open past 8 or 9 pm, and none of them will serve you a cocktail while you smoke. When I'm out with the pals and in the mood for a cigar, it's generally not before 8 pm. You've got to have a bit of forethought for that, and I'm rarely blamed for foreword thinking, that's for sure. Sure the drinks are premium priced, and the cigars too, but this is the spot when you're looking to pair them up.Note that smoking is only on their outdoor patio, and not in an inside lounge. It would be nice to find a spot with an inside smoking lounge in the downtown area, but beggars can't be choosers, right? :-/Happy Yelping Phoenix, see you around downtown!This isn't a "Jamaican spot". It's more like Fusion cuisine. And it's good for what it is, but it's not what I wanted. I just wanted a plate of Jamaican food, similar to what id get in a spot in Brooklyn.. This place is fancy, and they do a good job at that. They fit in well with what downtown phoenix is becoming. I got the scallops, it came with some spinach carrot mix. It was plated very well, presentation was A1.   Ambiance is very well executed. I think the prices are high, but then again I expected the type of Jamaican spot I'm used too, this place isn't that, but it is nice place to go out on a date. Somewhere where you would expect to pay about 40-45 dollars for dinner. I spent $13 plus tip for 2 scallops and a small veg medley and was still hungry.  In the future I'll find a hood Jamaican spot and get a full plate for $9this place is the pits. Also, you can't even order breadfruit at the breadfruit.I'm a huge fan of Jamaican food having a really good friend from the island that spoils me with authentic recipes that have passed down through generation in his family and traveling all over the world my palette is internationally known lol! Back to the story, needless to say my taste buds were going crazy with expectation! Well dannng, my girlfriend and I stood at the podium long enough to pull up Yelp and read several mixed reviews, since we had been noticed yet NO ONE was coming over to greet us we started toward the empty bar with one guy seated and a totally empty lounge area when we noticed the sign, "Please wait for server to be seared including the bar". So we waited and waited and waited until someone- anyone would make eye contact with us, finally a waitress approached us and asked if we have a reservation, I snickered like really, my girlfriend said no we do not and she stated it would be a wait haha okaaaay so we waited only shortly though. Once at the table we began browsing the drink menu in search of the Jamaican rum Wray&Nephew which they did so cool now as for the menu, we both noticed the absence of jerk wings hmm we thought maybe we'll ask our server. The server approached our table with a mouthful of the day's special selection and a great grasp of the menu, very impressive so we ordered Admiral's Punch and some starters: She had the Roasted Plantains with Chutney dip and I had the Baked Mango Fish Rolls. The plantains were soft not crisp and void of flavor as for my fish rolls they were pretty good but the fish was over cooked. The drinks were a bit weak until we added shots of Wray&Nephew. So as we sat sipping, a man stopped by our table and asked if we were enjoying our food, we looked at each other and she asked why jerk wings weren't served on the starter menu. The islander became very defensive explaining "his island eats the whole bird not just part of it", my girlfriend rebutted, having spent a lot of time in Jamaica feasting on local island cuisine as well as falling in love with the jerk wings! Wellll this stuck a nerve and to be quite honest I don't think he was expecting a real reply to his question just pretending to care. Needless to say, in life you meet some people that try so hard to upscale their image that they lose the true essence of their identity! Oh and he was rude because he kept wanting to rush off as if the place was packed lol! WARNING:  the only people that would be impressed by the food are those that have never truly experienced "real"Jamaican cuisine. And to think their "philosophy: Our philosophy is that good food should be good to eat...", my point exactly!In case you're wondering the one star was for having actual Jamaican rum!I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS PLACE!!! we arrived about 7 minutes earlier than our friends, and we waited about 15-20 min to be seated in an EMPTY place!First, we were "greeted" by a pretentious host, who tried so hard to make it seem as this place was the most chic and expensive restaurant in New York City! Haha NOPE!! We asked to be seated on the front patio since it was empty and it was super nice out. He quickly responded in a condescending way " No, patio is ONLY reserved for dining" "are you dining?" I was already over this place at this point.  Once the host decided enough time had passed he came and took us to the back patio, which is the smokers section... We were not smoking, we wanted to have a few drinks in a Non-smoking section... But I guess here you don't get the option. Anyway, it worked out after all since the place was empty. The host back here was nice and he did an ok job, but we asked to get a few drinks and an appetizer and we were told "We are not allowed to serve food back here" I was already over the pretentious attitude of this place and now I was over all the "Rules" they had.We order 4 drinks (all the same) and they only brought 3!  lol! I mean this place was EMPTY!! How can you forget 1 drink out of 4?! The drinks were Meh!, the pretentious service was Meh! And the tacky uncomfortable patio set was Meh! This could be an amazing place if they would only stop pretending this is fine dining, get rid of your host upfront and all your rules. Focus on making people comfortable and welcomed so they want to come back!I will NEVER BE BACK HERE AGAIN! so please don't waste your precious time and money. We drank our meh! Drinks payed our bill and took our party to Bliss Rebar, now this place was amazing. Drinks were great, food is great and the service is frendly and welcoming! Boom!! That's what you want as a review!
L'Express=with a handwritten menu, this place has all the charm and bustle of a real french bistro.be sure to be adventurous and try out their specialities.my father and i enjoyed the following at lunch:1. the roasted bone marrow - topped with a delicate lettuce leaf, each selected bone was a different height.  2. the mustard celery was fantastic!!!! thinly sliced and "pickled" with mustard, i devoured this right up.3. the veal kidneys with mushroom and house potatoes were excellent!  rich and filling.  this is a must try.4. the veal liver with perfect fries and homemade mayo is not for the faint of heart.  this was quite a generous portion.  it would be something that i normally would not try but now, i would order it in a second.  the dish was packed full of flavor!for dessert, we enjoyed a giant but light serving of the floating island - a lovely confection of whipped eggwhites with a sugar caramel crust topped with almond slices and floating on a sea of english cream.  it was the best one that i have ever sampled even compared to all the restos in paris.fast and friendly service, this is a definite stop for anyone - local or just visiting.  be sure to look around as you may spot a local celebrity or two.Excellent food, wine and service. The bartender was extremely knowledgeable and gave great recommendations along the way on food and pairings. They encouraged us to take our time and order each course as we were ready for the next.
Ranch House Grille=Cute...there's really no other word that covers what you see when you walk in to the Ranch House Grill:)There's gingham, lariats, spurs, split rails, barbed wire, saddles and all kinds of "ranchy" things in the décor.The décor is basically what my mother probably wanted to accomplish with the ranch house that I grew up in (and maybe could have, if she'd figured out how cover up the 40 year old wall paper, the dead white linoleum floors, and hot pink appliances and kitchen sink:(But enough about me:)The menu here is basic, but well executed, and what more can you ask from a place that bills itself as country cookin'?...Not much in my book:)This is the second RHG location (the first is in Page, on the way to Colorado City, I guess so you can fuel up with big food, so you have enough energy to "visit" all your wives:)This RHG location brings that small town, big food, restaurant feel to SE Phoenix:)Lunching with some buddies the other day...we decided to give RHG a test drive...none of us had been there before (in fact, I think lots people haven't been here...and they should be going to RHG:)Walked in at noon, had our drinks almost before we asked (I said "almost before"...to say we had them any sooner would imply a temporal causality paradox that I don't want to deal with here...email me if you want the math:)The menu is "robust"...not much in the "amuse bouche" section, but plenty of "steak and eggs" options.I selected Chicken Fried Steak with double mashed potatoes...and gravy...incredible, delectable gravy!:)RHG has a sign outside that says they have been voted "Best Chicken Fried Steak" in Phoenix, by somebody...I'm adding my vote to the total:)...It was outstanding...hand pounded round steak, sausage gravy, buttery mashed potatoes and thick toast...I haven't had CFS this good since the last time I was in Waco.My luncheon companions had, respectively, a Patty Melt (which he said was as good as any he'd ever had...hyperbole?...sure, but he's an attorney and given to hyperbole:), and a Chili and Cheese Omelet (BTW, I'm going back just for their chili...two kinds...red beef and green pork...both homemade and both crazy good:)The platters (that's right, I said "platters") of food arrived and we spent the next half hour wading through the food...more than plenty to eat!...a ranchers lunch in the truest sense of the word...enough food to keep you going through a long afternoon of building barb wire fence, bucking hay, herding recalcitrant bovines and mucking out the feed barn...none of which I have done since I was 15 years old...thank god!:)It also helps, even if you're just pounding out emails and answering phones:)Every so often, you need a lunch like this one...Mark Knopfler said it best..."if you want to run cool, you have to run on heavy, heavy fuel":)http://tinyurl.com/y8nw3dsThe bill came to about $10 apiece and the service was 25% tip range service:)I think RHG fits the description of "hidden gem":)...It is a gem and you really have to look for it to find it:)It will help if you look at the intersection of Thomas and 56th Street:)I'm dropping Ranch House Grill into the diner category, and in that category they rate a nice 3 stars.The service was prompt and friendly, the prices were fair and the food was pretty good.The huevos rancheros with roasted pork green chili was very tasty.  I would probably get that again if I were dining at Ranch House Grill again.The diced green chili and cheese omelet was less impressive.  The green chili in the omelet didn't have alot of flavor and the omelet itself needed more cheese.  The shredded potatoes were nice and buttery but I like them with some crispiness, at least on the top and bottom.  These were a bit soggy but still good.  They just needed another minute on the grill.
Brio Tuscan Grille=Town Square is the place to be for happy hour!  With so many choices - Brio Tuscan Grille is a great place to get your grub on for cheap!Their Tuscan Taster Menu is available in the bar area only and runsMonday through Friday: 3 pm to 6 pmSunday through Thursday: 9 pm to closeAll nine of their mouthwatering items are only $2.95!!  What a steal!* Braised Meatballs & Creamy Polenta "Topped with Marsala tomato sauce, Reggiano and parsley." - Three generous sized meatballs in a tasty and tangy sauce.  The polenta is a minimal amount the covers the bottom of the dish, but a nice touch.  The Husband really enjoyed this and was about to get another!* Beef Carpaccio "Served with field greens, capers, mustard aioli and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese." - Our favorite of the ones we tried, so we got two orders.  So good and tasty, and the field greens are a nice complement to the dish.* Margherita Flatbread "Fresh Mozzarella, vine-ripened tomatoes and fresh basil." - Very basic flatbread pizza, no fancy frills here.  A nice simple crunch.* Sliced Steak Bruschetta "With Gorgonzola Dolce, arugula, fennel, charred tomato, shaved Parmesan and Tuscan Italian dressing." - Four slices of bruschetta makes this a hearty dish with the cheese and beef.  Good flavors though and sauce adds a nice sweetness.Unfortunately, their happy hour only extends to the food so there are no drink specials.  (When I called, whomever answered said there were drink specials but it wasn't so when we sat down.)  The bartenders took our food and drink orders, and the food came out promptly.  We had no issues with service as a result unlike the other reviewers.Overall, it's a nice place and we enjoyed ourselves here.  The dining room looks like a grand hall with all the drapery.  I suggest getting your grub on here and getting drunk somewhere else if you want to save a few bucks.Update! 07/15/09 - Went back again last Friday and finished off the entire Tuscan Tasters menu.* Brio Burger "A quartet of BRIO's famous Bistecca Burgers, with smoked Mozzarella and housemade chips." - A very decent size burger for three bucks that was tasty and cut into four, perfect for sharing.  Chips were yummy too!* Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant "Grilled shrimp with Romano crusted eggplant and a black pepper cream sauce." - A surprise goodie!  Came with eight shrimp/eggplant stacks and definitely would definitely order again.* Sausage & Pepperoni Flatbread "Fresh Mozzarella and housemade tomato sauce." - Good pizza where they aren't shy about the toppings.* Shrimptini "Chilled shrimp served in a martini glass with roasted tomato cocktail sauce and fresh lemon."  Uneventful of the bunch, fine for simple shrimp but lacks any excitement.* Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta "With fresh basil and balsamic drizzle." - Tasty bread bites with four pieces of bruschetta.This time we went with a group of four and ordered one of everything.  It pretty much filled us for the most part, although if you're hungry, just double up on the burgers and meatballs.  We grabbed a little table this time in the bar area inside and our waitress was fine again.  It took a bit of time to get the table cleared and for the orders to go in, but nothing to complain about.  Overall, they did well again for filling our tummies on a budget!When I hit up Vegas I don't usually hit up restaurants.  I know some of you are probably thinking... Why not?  Don't they have tons of great restaurants out in the City of Gluttony?   True that... But!  Remember!  This is also home to endless scrumptious buffets as well!  How can I let that slide right?  Ok... so I ended up at a restaurant this time around... Buffets I'll see you on my next trip.Stopped by this hidden shopping plaza near the South end of the strip... Yes!  There is one real nice shopping mall and it's not an outlet!  (Town Square)  This plaza is totally nice and especially during the winter time coz it's got such a cozy feel to it... since we were looking for food, we came, we searched, and we landed at Brio Tuscan Grille.Initially I thought I wasn't going to like it, but I'm glad that I was wrong.  Let me tell you why this is definitely a place that I'd go back again...Décor:  Awesome!  Interior design at this place rivals those at the Grand Lux café except much fancier!  Dim, beautiful lighting, and awesome outdoor patio with a fire pit for a nice little gathering should you have a large party.Food was actually more tastier than I was expecting...  Here were just the few that I've sampled-Calamari:  Flash fried to perfection with aioli dipping sauce, yum!-Penne Gorgonzola:   Off the hook good with just the right amount of sauce-Fettuccine Rustica:  Just ok... not enough sauce for my taste-Chipotle Chicken and Bacon Panini:  One of the best sandwiches I've had!  The bread was toasted beyond perfection to a point that it is crispy yet chewy!!! Not sure how that happened but I really need to try more paninis and see if they all taste this good!  Then the chipotle flavor coupled with load of chicken was just awesome!  (Yes, this was my dish!)Service was wonderful too!  Water was always filled to the rim without requesting them to come by to do so, and they also allow dogs to be right by the gate so our buddies can share some food with us!  (not inside but at least near us)Price:  Very reasonable!  Majority of the dishes for lunch runs no more than $15 and good portions too!If you are in the Sin City and craving Italian, do help your wallet a favor by giving this place a visit instead of some fancy Italian joint inside the casino... you won't regret it!One of my best dining experiences ever!!!!What could be better than a pleasant and romantic Las Vegas night with your BF in a place with world class service, ambience and food? I am not exaggerating! You heard it - world class! I simply did not expect this at all - it was that great!From the moment we walked around the beautiful exterior of the restaurant and sat in the waiting area and got to see the gorgeous interior of the restaurant I had a great feeling the experience would be great - but it actually excelled that expectation!We were seated quickly even though we were told we would wait a bit longer. I could not help but look at the pretty earth toned surroundings while my BF and I chatted away. I had read that the risotto was great here so I looked for it on the menu but could not find it. Well, the waiter overheard that I was looking for the risotto and he said that he would see if they could make it for me anyway. WOW!!!! Double WOW actually, because he came back soon and said that they would make it for me! The bread basket here is just great! They kept it coming too! They serve a thin crisp bread which is just divine!Their iced tea is great and it kept coming too! We never had to ask for anything. The waiter was always looking to make our meal just perfect! You should have seen us drink it too! The hot desert night made us so thirsty!My shrimp risotto with red pepper was a dream of a dish! The rice was just right and the creamy sauce was ever so tasty! The shrimp were fresh and cooked to perfection! I am not a big fan of any kind of pepper but they integrated the pepper into the dish ever so subtly and created just the right level of spiciness! It is like they read my mind! OMG!!!!My BF had grilled shrimp, steak and chicken. It was soooo tender and juicy that I just wanted to cry tears of the utmost food ecstasy! It all had a really nice grilled taste to it too!This place was recommended to us by a good friend of my BF and he really impressed me with his taste on this one! Thanks Pedro!Parking is no issue since Brio Tuscan Grille is located in a large mall. There is outdoor seating as well. Great for people watching! Let no one fool you - this is no average Italian restaurant!Brio is one of our loves and the place we like to go for birthday dinners, family get togethers. It's very pretty inside and the beautiful decor reflects the good food.They have a full bar and happy hour and a wonderful outdoor seating area where you can people watch while enjoying your meal.I have a great affinity for the flatbread that comes in their bread basket. Crispy triangles that are coated in herbs, sesame seeds, and cheese full of flavor and texture.Our favorite is the Pasta alla Vodka. That is why we come to Brio.My heart skips a little beat when they put this dish down in front of me and shower it in finely grated parmesan cheese. The aroma of the vodka sauce is one I have not experiened in any other Italian restaurant. Can't quite put my finger on what makes that distinctive delicious Brio Vodka sauce so special. Maybe it's the garlic that's been shaved thin (with razor blades?), or the fresh basil that perfumes the sauce, or it's the star of the dish...the soft pillows of heaven...the delicate ricotta filled pasta purses that melt in your mouth and go oh so very well with the sauce. I swear someone else must be eating my dish because it goes too quick until you devour the last of the pasta and reach for the sourdough bread to sop up the rest of this amazing sauce...it would be a sin not to!This is all I want to write about Brio, because when you come there you must order the Pasta Alla Vodka :)So glad we ended up here last night!We started off at Texas De Brazil but the wait was over and hour and a half! Then we tried Tommy Bahamas and they were closed for a private event!Finally we happened upon Brio and their wait was over an hour!We slipped into the bar and as fate would have it a table was getting up to leave right as we walked in!! So we swooped the table like the stealthy women we are and all was right with the world.We had an amazing server! We had a few drinks and I have to say their Raspberry Mojito is a must try!We started with the Carpaccio appetizer and it was absolutely heavenly. Like I'm crazing it right now at 8:00AM just writing about it good.For our main course we had the Steak salad and the Salmon salad. Both were ginormous portions and incredibly tasty. Neither of us were able to finish them and we left incredibly satisfied!This will definitely be a go to for girls night!Oh sweet, sweet Brio.  I absolutely love this place.  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  Yes, it's a chain, but I definitely give props to a restaurant chain that makes food as delicious as Brio.  There are no negatives or neutrals about this place.+ Wonderful service.  Our waitress was so nice.  She helped me make a decision on my meal and she was very knowledgeable of the menu.  Also, the other employees were happy and spunky.+ You can add or modify your meal as needed.  A lot of big restaurants (especially more expensive ones) don't allow you do personalize your meal.+ FOOD.  Oh my goodness.  If you want a meal that is flavorful, cooked right, and unique, you have to try this place.  I ordered the Mushroom Ravioli and it was the best meal I've ever had.  I could taste the different cheeses, the pasta was cooked perfectly, and it melted in my mouth.  My mom ordered a chicken dish and it came with two large chicken breasts and vegetables (she substituted rice for veggies).  Of course, I'm vegetarian and can't eat meat, but the veggies were ridiculous!! They were so delicious.+ Prices and portions.  Yes, the prices are a tad high, but the portions make it worth it.  I had ten large raviolis stuffed well with mushrooms.  It could easily be split into two meals.+ Creme brulee.  They have about eight different kinds of creme brulee to choose from.  I ordered the chocolate cake, the original and caramel.  Fantabulous.  Spectacular.  Even if you don't eat a meal here, you MUST try their desserts!!  It will be the best thing you ever do for yourself.I had wanted to try the happy hour here but just missed it (ends at 6) and decided to stay and try out dinner. They have a nice big patio along a not too busy street. This is a nice place to come on a date in this area. I asked if they made any of their pastas in house and the only one that I was told was made fresh was the fettuccine so I substituted it in the garganelli carbonara dish. It was yummy. A good balance of pasta, sauce, chicken and spinach. I usually never have enough chicken for the pasta, but I actually had chicken and not pasta left. My boyfriend had the lasagna. I took one bite and thought it was really good. He said it had some hard chunks of tomato that he wasn't too fond of. We asked for more bread, which never came because it was frozen or something. We were told it was delayed, but it never came. We had the vanilla bean creme brulee and caramel creme brulee. It was served in these small tea cups which were the perfect size for an after dinner treat. The caramel was my favorite and they were only $2.45 each. I didn't try the bruschetta, but it looked delicious and I will definitely come back to try it. Please bring your patience. It took over an hour and a half to have dinner here and all we had were our pasta dishes and dessert (no appetizer or salads).9/18Checked out their happy hour- select apps $2.95 each!  However, no specials on the alcoholic beverages, with a quick glance at the wines-by-the-glass revealing prices of about $9 and up.  Thank goodness Total Wine and More was holding its grand opening (w/ a penny wine-tasting!) that day... Violeta and I decided to try a few apps here and then head straight to Total Wine for the liquid component :)I should make a correction to the last statement above- it was I that tried a few apps- the Sliced steak brushetta and the Brio brushetta quattro," while Violeta H. tried the Margherita flatbread.  My apps were both outstanding!  I could probably be satisfied w/ two orders of the steak brushetta (loved that Tuscan Italian dressing!), while an order of the brushetta quattro would suffice (it's their burger, quartered, and a side of homemade potato chips).  While I had my hands full w/ the two apps AND their great sourdough table bread (there were also some great-looking seeded crackers/flatbread, too, but I couldn't try it due to food allergies), Violeta confided that she loved her Margherita flatbread.  Brio Tuscan Grille's happy hour, despite the lack of discounted beverages, provides impressive hors d'oeuvres at exceptional value.  I'll definitely visit again =)We've gone to Brio a couple of times now and have been pleased. This most recent time, I went with my mom & bf and really enjoyed our experience. Our waitress came by after we were seated and took our drink orders immediately. She was great in coming by the entire night to check on us if we needed anything, got us drink refills, etc.For food, my bf really wanted some eggplant. Although there's no entree with eggplant on the menu, our waitress said that the kitchen would be able to make eggplant parmesan. Exactly what he was looking for! Me and my mom shared the Pasta Brio with chicken. I snagged a bite of the eggplant and thought it was cooked well, the breading wasn't too thick & it was really flavorful. Only thing lacking was maybe a bit of the pasta sauce since there was quite a bit of pasta that came with the dish. The Pasta Brio was cooked al dente and even though the split portion looked small, it was actually very filling. My mom doesn't like mushrooms so I got all of them, which made me realize that there were actually more than I thought/expected! They didn't skimp on those nor the portion of chicken.The prices of the entrees are a bit on the high side, however I think for the quality of food, I can still justify giving them a solid 4 stars. We'd recommend this restaurant to others.
Brooklyns Best Bagel and Deli=It's fast, it's friendly and about as inexpensive as you can get in Desert Ridge.  Wasn't blown away by thier food, but I would go back.
Primanti Brothers at PNC Park=***The good thing about the concessions at PNC Park is that they feature local brands/products like Primanti Brothers; the bad thing (and definitely not surprising) is that the ballpark version of Primanti Brothers is probably not a good representation of their food***I have never been to an actual Primanti Brothers location, but I've heard of it.  This Primanti Brothers location is inside PNC Park and it features a limited menu (a few sandwiches and their fries).  The sandwiches are served on thick bread and topped with French fries.I ordered some of their French fries as a side.  They were freshly cut, but the fries had been sitting around for a while.  Some of the fries were crisp, but most of them were limp, soggy and cold (they were also quite greasy).  With the skin on and everything, the fries might capture the great and guilty pleasure experience of carnival fries when they are served just out of the fryer.  But given that the fries are so unevenly cut here, you still may not get consistently great fries with one order (even when they are hot and fresh).Cheese dip is also available for an extra charge.  The cheese dip was the standard cheese dip you get with stadium nachos.The fries were expensive, but I did purchase them at a ballpark and the portion size was generous.Service was fine and quick.Since ballpark food often sits around (I had a similar experience with garlic fries at AT&T Park in San Francisco), PNC Park is probably not the best location to try Primanti Brothers.  The fact that Primanti Brothers is a local product might make you consider giving it a try over other generic concession food at PNC Park.  That being said, PNC Park seems to feature a lot of local food so you may want to explore the park a little before committing to Primanti Brothers (or at the very least, you should request the staff to serve you a fresh batch of food).Primanti Brothers is located within the stadium so it is only for ticket owners.  There are several parking lots and structures nearby.  The lot right next to PNC Park is $25, but a structure just one block over is only $15.
Pizza Brutta=some gouddda pizzzza, though expectations were high so ehh.ingredients are fresh, kept simple. all about minimalism. classic thin crust dough. twas good, but didn't blow me away. although I've never been one for thin pizzas (unless it is Ian's..they do their crust so right: crispy, yet doughy, so good). dough here was a bit on the gummy side?? if that's a thing. we tried:pizza bianca - olive oil, basil, garlic, fresh mozzarellapizza rossoverde - basil, prosciutto, parmesan, arugula, mozzarellacustomized pizza of mozzarella, parmesan, fennel sausagealso ordered the caprese salad - tomatoes, basil, housemade fresh mozzarella, olive oil, sea salt^^delicious.not sure which pizza was my favorite. all were pretty aight flavor wise. their pizzas are on the smaller size, so if you are starving, you should order six of them and you could probably polish them off just fine..*exaggeration*I'll be back to see if they can't impress me more next time.
YOLOS=Pretty tasty sweet corn tamales and huge margaritas....raspberry flavor to boot. Service was okay, but the chips and salsa were spot on, just like Chevys...yep almost my favorite. Small, inside location, quite accommodating.Best part...didn't have to pay. Me likey.The food was good. They make the guacamole table side and give you the option to not include any of the ingredients. I heard the flautas were amazing, but didn't try them. I got the barbecued salmon with mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus. Salmon with 2 of my favorite side dishes are hard to beat. Perfect amount of food too. Enough to create a nice base for drinking all night, but not too much that you feel bad leaving most of it behind. I felt the specialty drinks were a touch too sweet, but you could tell they were made well. Also our server was incredibly nice and not just split up the tab for us but also split the shared items so we were charged a fraction of each.After finding out it would be a 2 hour wait at Gordon Ramday BurGR, we decided to hang out inside YOLOS (they had no wait) for drinks and appetizers. I was first impressed by the large, long booth we were sat at. That quickly changed when the people at our table kept kicking each other. There was no room under the table for us to sit comfortably. Our server was quick to take our drink order and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. We ordered a "Quesadilla" priced at $10 and "Empanadas" priced at $10 for our snackage. The quesadilla had jack cheese, onions and peppers inside. It also came with a side of salsa, sour cream and guacamole. The quesadilla was good, but average. If you want beef, chicken or shrimp in it then it will cost you $4-$5 more. The empanadas were well liked by hubby and I. They were stuffed with chorizo and had a green chile avocado salsa underneath them. The only complaint I have about that dish is the size of it. They put enough of the green chile avocado salsa on the plate so why not add just 1 more empanada to make it an even 4? If this were a cocktail party I could understand the small bites and portions, but this wasn't the case. With 4 people at our table it was awkward so hubby and I just ended up splitting one of them. The margarita did taste decent! They have lunch specials during the week that right now start at $9.95 and a Happy Hour at the bar as well. Also beware about the music inside this place. it's very loud and it's hard to have a conversation with the people sitting right at your table.Stopped in here to hang with some friends and most likely won't be back. The music is way to damn loud. Seriously you can't hear the person sitting right next to you let alone sitting across from you. The booths are so cramped together that you play a game of "kicking footsie" with others at your table. My wife accidentally got kicked from the person sitting across from her and she was bleeding. Like missing a toenail bleeding. The food tasted decent however you don't get enough for the cost and it certainly isn't authentic Mexican food.
Bradbury's=BESTEST CREPES. ME LIKEY.I've experienced quite a few...multiple times...These guys have mastered the Art of Crepe. Yes. It's a thing. Spot-on thickness. Splendid texture, akin to the dense-quality of a good pancake, yet not so doughy. Plus they've got an oh-so-delicate sweetness that allows for versatility as far as making these beauties sweet or savory.  *Dark chocolate, caramel, sea salt crepe - FAN-frickin-TASTIC. My most-ordered crepe from here. The one that I dream about at night. I no lie. *Pumpkin mascarpone pecan crepe - SEASONAL, sigh. *Lemon curd and whipped cream crepe - in the words of my dear, econ-majoring friend: "THE TANGENCY!" (for the mathaphobes out there - this is code for: she loved it)*Apples and caramel and pecan crepe - one of their greatest. (certainly on par with the dark chocolate one I crave every waking moment of my life) the sugary deliciousness of the caramel...with the sweet crunch from the apples and the indulgent flavor of the pecans - love.*Smoked prosciutto spinach parmesan scrambled - this is the one savory crepe I've dabbled into, though this was my friend's order so I only took a few bites. Tasty nonetheless. As far as beverages: I've had their peppermint tea. Check mate. And their chai latte can't be beat. The Art of Crepe carries over to the Art of Latte/latte art - they've got this down man. Delicious AND beautiful bevvies. Basically, I love you Bradbury. One of my favorite spots - to study/chill/gastronomically indulge - in Madison.I love Bradbury's. I live a block away and head here just about every weekend. Their crepes are really tasty and their coffee is great, too. I also appreciate that they have fast wifi and even though it can get a little tight (it's a small place), I've never not been able to find a seat. Plus, the big windows make it the perfect place to absorb a sunny morning and do some people-watching.
Patati Patata=I had Patati Patata on my list of "must try" places in Montreal and I STILL managed to walk right past it earlier in the day without noticing it.  Patati Patata is super small (I can't imagine it seating more than 15 people) and unobtrusive, but it is fantastic.  You can opt to sit at the counter or one of three or four tables.  I wouldn't recommend this place for parties of more than two - you're going to have a very  hard time finding some configuration so you can sit together.  I saw lots of people getting takeout from the counter (fill your order in on little slips of paper, hand it over, wait briefly, receive cheap delicious food, hand over coins rather than bills (oh, Canada!), and go).Patati Patata served up the best poutine I had in Montreal (though granted, I only had it twice) with onions and green peppers for $4.  Amazing.  Even MORE amazing, 10 oz. beers were $2.50.  Even with the waning exchange rate advantage, that's awesome!  The staff is a little brusque (they're super busy) but also nice.  One of the counter guys offered the girls behind me free beer because he had to change the taps.  They were drinking the red, and I had the blonde so I got no free beer.  Drat.I will say Patati Patata is not a place to linger.  There was a line out the door on the Thursday evening I went (it seemed to be mostly university students) so I finished as quickly as I could. Before I was even to the register, my seat had been snatched, but I think that's more a testament to how good this place is than anything else.I came here in Summer 2013 (twice) and I loved it!  Their prices are very reasonable and I ordered take out twice because I didn't want to wait for a table.  The restaurant is very small and can only seat up to around 15 people I believe.The burgers are very cheap (I believe around two bucks) so ordering two will fill you up easily.  Their fish burger is also very tasty and their poutine is decent.  The walk from central Montreal is perhaps 15-25 minutes so I feel like it's worth it since there is a lot to see on the way to this restaurant.The restaurant is actually pretty hard to spot because the name is kind of hidden so you might want to look it up on google images to prepare yourself. (or just use GPS on your phone if you have data)  Patati Patata is the epitome of the term  "cheap eats" and definitely should be visited by anybody, not only people on a budget!
Cho Won Garden=So we were wondering about the Korean options in Charlotte - or lack thereof - and finally Yelp-searched the situation.  The only real contender according to our search was Cho Won.  So we checked it out one recent Saturday for lunch.Disclaimer: we went after "slaying" a workout session at the gym, and since exercise = hunger, and hunger = the best sauce, it could be that our ravenous appetites would have made any meal seem like a sumptuous feast.Anyway, we got our menus and realized that this place is pretty expensive.  A lot of the entrees and BBQ options were up in the $20-30 range.  Even a lot of the appetizers were over $10.  We were all "WTF?"  Then we took chill pills and decided to order the cheapest thing on the menu, bibimbap.  Actually, that's what I wanted in the first place.  The bibimbap was $10, or $13 for the hot stone bowl version that makes the rice all crispy.  We both got the former.  At $10, it was a little high compared to Korean joints in Chicago or NYC, but only by a couple bucks.But we got our money's worth.  The bibimbap was as good as any I've had, but we also got the full-on Korean BBQ side dish treatment: seven or eight sides plus a bowl of soup came with the bibimbap, and the waiter asked repeatedly if we wanted more (refills on the sides were free).Everything was super fresh, super tasty, spiced well, just awesome.They've got some good lunch specials if you can make it out there on a weekday.Can't wait to go back on a special occasion and splurge on the non-bibimbap options.
Grimaldi's Pizzeria=We visited our friends in Goodyear and I was kind of psyched to revisit Taste of Italy 2 where we had pizza the last time. Our local friends wanted to take us to Grimaldi's instead, their favorite pizzeria about 20 minutes away. Being the Yelpcurious sort, I was game to try this much hyped place. The downside to a place that has been hyped is that one's expectations are higher. We ordered:* Mediterranean Salad - Tasted fresh and good, but the dressing wasn't very balanced. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=ARQro-dR-8Hd90yb1yUyAQ* Pizza half plain cheese, half with basil and tomatoes http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=SbHD7fVvL32LgaUIpCBq9Q* Pizza with sausage, pepperoni, and basil http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=wl7YMUaOquTxdYgR4SG6Hg* Louis Martini Cabernet - for our friend* Red Sangria - for our friendPositives:+ I'm all about the thin crust. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=qf12YBWeKcLe2leFp09fPA+ The sauce has a nice kick to it.+ The fresh mozzarella tasted good. In fact, everything was very fresh.+ They give kids pizza dough to play with while waiting for the food - fun! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=9ZRm5qrrVJIQDnohj1llDANegatives:- There was a 45 minute wait - the price of popularity.- The service had chain feel to it that didn't rub me the right way. "I'm (server's name), and I'm going to take care of you." It was friendly enough, but wasn't for me.- My friend's pizza didn't have enough basil, and she asked for more. Our server said she could bring more for $2. That was disappointing for a tiny dish of chopped basil, considering it was already a topping and our $75 bill.Overall, I enjoyed the pizza and the kid-friendly atmosphere. It wasn't the best ever, but I'm a fan.3.5 stars!  After doing some light shopping in the Park West area, my friend and I stopped into Grimaldi's Pizzeria for a quick bite.The coal-brick oven was a pretty enticing feature and my friend and I ordered two personal pizzas.  The crust was thin, crispy, and had a good amount of char.  The tomato sauce also had decent flavor.  What I didn't enjoy was paying for each topping I wanted.  It can go from a $10 pizza up to a $20 pizza easily... and this is for a small 12" pie!  We passed up on dessert and just headed over to the chocolate shop across the way. Grimaldi's is a cute little restaurant with lots to offer.  It's a tasty pie but for the price, I rather eat elsewhere.I have been the original Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge & the location in NYC and I have to say...  Eating at the Peoria location brings me back to my NY trips!  Of course, without the heavy winter coat, shaking in the cold, and wind in my face while waiting for 45 mins for a table for two.  I am here in AZ, in flipflops and enjoying the weather while waiting outside on the bench!  :)  The service was great (no asking for refills).  He checked on us a few times.  I had the white pizza with chicken and bacon...  YUM!  I am still in love with the regular red sauce.  Guess I need to go back soon!Grimaldis is a nice pizza restaurant with amazing thin crust pizza. The pizza is thin, but not too thin where it's crunchy. They also have a variety of salads most standard. It's a very simple yet good menu. The New York cheesecake does not disappoint either. It's so rich and creamy and not overly sweet just perfect. The waitress was great also and made us feel right at home. Only reason for the 4 stars is it's very pricey. If you come here you will pay top dollar for these great pizzas. It's a must try!
TaCarbon=I can't find a better Mexican grill anywhere. I'm addicted to their pastor, asada, and quesadillas. Their service has improved, so it's only a few minutes for my meal on even the most crowded days. And the prices are modest for the quality of your meal. Next time you're in the west valley and want Mexican, come HERE. If you had another place in mind, I doubt it's as good!This place is without question my favorite Taco Shop in AZ !!!! Period!!I had no idea what I was missing until I was brought to this wonderful establishment by a friend of mine.So here's how it works, they grill up the meat and tortillas on a Mequite Fired Grille. You will not believe what kind of flavor it adds to the meat. They offer the standard Carne Asada for the White Boys, but I would stay away. It is far too simple.If you want to experience some real flavor, go for the Barbacoa, Lengua, Al Pastor, or Tripas. The Tripas are deep fried and so damn flavorful.They have a ridiculous salsa bar, with amazing salsa's, but you have to ask for the Habanero which they keep behind the bar. They also have fresh cabbage, onions, limes, and peppers with carrots at the salsa bar.All I can say, is you have to experience the simplicity and mesh of natural flavors. The true experience and blend of flavors is truly indescribable.The place is clean, super authentic, and always full, even in the morning hours.it is a straight up Mexican Joint, so learn some damn Spanish and be respectful!This place is so worth the drive, I now go there at least once a week! I'm craving this place just writing about it.Trust me on this place, and write a more descriptive review and tell me how right I was by recommending this place. I swear that they put something in the meat to get people addicted, it's that good!Salute! =)Ok...so I know I have said this before, but this is legit.  These are the best tacos in the valley...perhaps anywhere! It wouldn't have even happened had Fajardo's Cafe been open! We had driven out to Glendale and it was closed, so I jumped on Yelp and this place came up!  It's a very small place and if I hadn't read Floyd C's review, I probably wouldn't have found it! (Thanks, Floyd!!!)  It is on the north east corner of 59th Ave and Camelback.  However, it is facing 59th avenue...yeah.  we drove around a few times...then read the review! Oh....gotta love random adventures leading to a diamond in the rough!You go up to the counter, order...and they hand you a little plate to fill with all of the fixings they have at the salsa bar...which to be honest...they're all AMAZING!!!!  Plus, they have cucumbers, lettuce, onion/cilantro mix, carrots and limes! LIMES!! Remember...I have a lime fetish.  ***the ONLY complaint I have...and it is not even that big of a deal and I won't be taking any stars away is that they don't have cilantro alone...I hate raw onions. Like to the point of having a close to "ick" reaction! *** Anywhoooo...I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and a lengua taco with a side of beans.The lengua (tongue...yes tongue) is absolutely flavorful and SOOOOOOOOO tender!  The carne asada is probably the most flavorful I have ever had here in the valley!  The beans are amazing and super yummy...it seems to me that they have chorizo and cheese in them.  The service is quick and not so personable, but not rude at all! They are busy and are pretty much just making sure to get everyone their orders!  We will be back! Every Tuesday! ;-)Wanna know how much we enjoyed our meal?  We each ordered a carne asada burrito to go...for lunch tomorrow!  We never do that!  So who is up for Taco Wednesday? Thursday? Any day that ends in "Y"??
Restaurant Ong Ca Can=If you are Vietnamese or appreciate Vietnamese food, and are looking for Bo Bay Mon (7 Courses of Beef), this is the best place in the Montreal Metro area to get it. It may not be as good as Westminster's Little Saigon or San Jose, but for Montreal, it is the best. This on recommendation of the Vietnamese locals.If you like Beef and Vietnamese food, this is the choice for you. If you have never had this 7 course meal wich is becoming very popular on the West Coast of the US, check it out, or bring  a Viet friend to show you the ropes on how to eat each course.
RE Tapas=Ok so really I know my tapas. I've been to Spain and spent hours in a tapas bar drinking wine eating great food and enjoying great conversation. This comes real close to the tastes. I came here with a small group with intentions to see what Chef Errol was all about. I was very impressed with the fact he was using Food Science which is the new cutting edge trends hitting up many spots in LA and NY.The ambiance of the place is very dark, clean, and comfortable. The staff was exceptionally nice.We let Chef decide what to make for us. The drinks were very good. Made from fresh ingredients. This place also has a guiness surger! SCORE!The food is exceptional and the price is definitely reasonable.I enjoyed the grilled romaine salad. Very flavorful. The salad was warm and you can really taste the dressing and the individual flavors. The lamb was phenomenal. We enjoyed the Carpaccio, LOBSTER, and tortilla espaniola which is so authentic spanish.(It wasn't room temperature which is how it's supposed to be served) It was warm and tasty with the herbs and potatoes. Definitely try the duck breast. - I usually like it more rare, but it was definitely delish. The dessert presentation was very classy yet cutting edge. Truffles and Kai Vodka? PHENOMENAL! If you get a chance you definitely should try this out.I'm not really too sure why there were even bad reviews. HATERS!
Black Bear Diner=I have this recurring dream where I'm lying in bed, and my friend Tyrone calls. And he's all "I can dig more clams than you!" And I'm like "No wai!" And then I spend the rest of the dream looking for a place to park. I don't know where that dream came from. I don't even know anyone named Tyrone.But if I did this is where I would take him. Because Black Bear Diner is as surreal as road trip dining gets. The ironic pictures featuring little bears trying to do what humans do ("haha! Silly bear! Manual transmissions are for humans! One day you will become somebody's rug! Ha ha!). The suspenders. Reading your menu from an old Goodyear Gazette. The faint presence of Wilford Brimley in the air. Wilford Brimley is everywhere, and can take many forms.*But alas, Tyrone is not real, and so therefore did not make a suitable dining companion. But Misty S is very much real (and very much my squeeze), so I brought her here instead.Our initial disappointment at the absence of African-American leather daddies aside, we quite enjoyed ourselves.She ordered the pot roast, and me the chicken fried steak. Both came with a side of mashed potatoes (you get your choice of two from a list of six or so) that came topped with gravy that matched the entree. This was done without prompting. I was so excited to see my meat and potatoes so perfectly accessorized that I nearly shat glitter.BBD's claim to fame is giving you a lot of food. It says so like twenty times on their menu. And in reality it is a lot. So much that you can hear the strained whines and cries of other patrons trying to finish their garlic bread. Or was it Texas Toast? I don't think it counts as Texas Toast if it's only grilled on one side. Why do I keep capitalizing Texas Toast? And why is everyone staring at me? Is it because I'm not dry heaving my way through my entree?Oh shit, is there glitter on my seat?*My review of Trader Joe's. Oh snap, self-reference!9/04I like!  Not all diners can take me back to my first months living in CA.  Stepping into this Black Bear Diner, I felt like I had stepped into my uncle's Buckhorn motel and restaurant (sold a long time ago), thanks to the comforting aromas of coffee and breakfast cooking on the griddle, and the hustle-bustle of a busy diner!Our server was friendly, prompt, and efficient.  No complaints there.  Still no complaints when we received our orders of the daily special of NY steak and eggs (which came with hash browns and choice of bread: muffin, toast, pancake http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=q7dK8yU76GIyLxt6KVjrHQ#q7dK8yU76GIyLxt6KVjrHQ , or biscuit) and a plate of biscuits and gravy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=EpBzkp0dH2QNe4m-F7F4dQ#EpBzkp0dH2QNe4m-F7F4dQ  Loved that she asked us how we wanted the steak cooked- medium rare to medium, please. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=30v8SVaQU2f7AcTsPIRd2w#30v8SVaQU2f7AcTsPIRd2w  Oh, and she was thoughtful enough to split our entree when all we had asked was to have an extra plate. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=RCVOGduEtBFY2S63er9qlA#RCVOGduEtBFY2S63er9qlA  She even remembered that I didn't want to have any of the eggs... cool.Everything was delicious!  The color/temperature of the steak was perfect!  I did ask for the hash browns be cooked extra crispy, and it wasn't, but no big deal, since we had the lovely biscuits and gravy to contend with, too.  (I suggest you get your fill of the B&G when fresh, 'cause they're not good eats hours later, most notably the gravy... ugh.)Glad to find another breakfast eatery to take my Mom to!I wrote a scathing review of BBD but I will reluctantly upgrade it from 1 star to 3 stars. David D. at customer service responded to my complaints promptly and politely. No...I did not receive a comp. nor did I want any. My only hope is they will take care of their problems as he stated to me in his reply so unsuspecting customers will no longer be taken advantage of. No....I definitely will still not be returning nor recommend them to anyone!One of my favorite places to eat breakfast in Arizona! When we go out for spring training each year, its a must we stop when we arrive in AZ , and as we leave AZ! Gets pretty packed but they get people in quick. Love their omelettes and all dishes are huge portions and good service. They even sell their own hot sauce which is good too! Recommend Papa Burn sauceBeing an Arizona native, walking into Black Bear Diner the first time was a surprise.  Whoa.  Did I get transported to Redding, California or something?  It was like we stepped out of the concrete jungle of Goodyear and into a log cabin in the woods.  Hansel, get Gretel out of the oven!I've visited this location for the past five or six years and the food is always great whether you come for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  The portions are generous and the food is always brought to you hot.  The chicken fried steak is one of my favorites and the chicken pot pie is pretty solid too.  I haven't tried their tempting desserts since I'm always beyond-stuffed by the time I'm finished with my meal but they got a delicious maltshake.  Malts... so much better than regular milkshakes!Black Bear Diner is a cute rustic-looking eatery with friendly service and good food.  Come and give them a try!  I'd take BBD over Denny's and IHOP any day.This place is literally within walking distance from my apartment, yet I have passed by it daily. This morning I was hungry for breakfast and had a lot of things to do so I thought I would try something close. I have noticed the parking lot is usually full, so I thought it must be good. I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table. The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee. The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone. The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee. I don't know how I have overlooked this place but based on the experience today, I would put it right at the top of best spots in town for breakfast. I will say come early because by the time I was leaving the lobby was full, people were milling around the parking lot, and the wait to be seated was 15 minutes.Fantastic food, but I wish I could give this location zero stars for my experience.  On Father's Day (two weeks ago) my family went to Black Bear Diner to celebrate my Grandfather.  There was a total of five adults and we ended up spending about $50.  The food was absolutely worth the money!  I got "The Griz" and it arrived on two gigantic plates filled to the brim.  It tasted great and was satisfying.  We were also celebrating a Birthday in the group and the server brought out a free peach cobbler for her.  The place was busy and a little messy inside, but this is to be expected on a day like this.  Up until this point, we were having a great time, but going to the restrooms changed everything!I had to take my very elderly Grandfather to the men's room, where there was what appeared to be a Black Bear Diner worker (wearing one of their shirts) exiting a stall, that was not properly flushed.  There was a second Black Bear Diner worker entering the men's room behind us.  The two workers exchanged fist bumps and words, before the first worker (who just left a used toilet) exited the men's room WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS!  I know he didn't wash his hands because since I was holding the door open for my Grandfather, my back was to the sinks and watched him slip right out the door.  If I did not have to constantly be at my Grandfather's side, i would have followed the worker out of the men's room and confronted him.  To add insult to injury, there is a sign next to the sinks saying employees must wash hands.  After exiting the men's room and washing up, we left immediately.  My stomach was churning thinking that this guy might have handled food without having clean hands.  As we left, a worker at the front desk was notified and she said she would take care of it.  I left an email that night with the main email address for Black Bear Diner and the Gilbert store.  After one week, I did not have any response, so I went to Facebook, where they finally responded.  I ended up speaking to a very nice lady at the Black Bear Diner headquarters.  However, since this location is a franchise store, it seems that headquarters cannot do much.  I told the lady at their headquarters to pass along my contact info to the Gilbert store.  It has been two weeks since the visit and have not heard anything from the Gilbert store.  The best food in the world can not make up for a worker not washing their hand after using the restroom.
The Farm Kitchen=I adore places that transport you to another locale without even driving too far! One beautiful sunny afternoon, I asked a friend to have lunch with me at The Farm Kitchen. We only drove 5 minutes away from the office and we were on a farm at a picnic table enjoying a wonderful lunch. The line had already started to form for the lunch at the Farm. We walked into a little building lined with racks of local product to peruse while you wait to get your order started. For my lunch I chose the turkey curry sandwich, a slice of pecan pie and a lemonade. Everything was really tasty. I could have used more mayo on my sandwich, but that was a personal preference. The curry on the sandwich wasn't overpowering. It was wonderfully complimented by the sweet cranberries. The pecan pie was so good! My lunch pal left her dessert alone to dig into my pie! The lemonade was, lemonade. Not to sweet, not too tart. The Farm Kitchen is a great place to step away from it all if only for a lunch hour. The food is good and well made, and the setting just can't be beat!I'm a huge fan of the Farm Kitchen on Maya's farm.   I frequent the farm businesses and I am a CSA member of the farm itself.  So, of course, I have very high marks for this farm in general.  The Farm Kitchen is a casual dining experience suitable for a date picnic or girlfriends lunch in an open air patio with quaint picnic baskets to boot.For the novice visitor to Maya's Farm, there are 3 restaurants.  The Farm Kitchen is in the "Little house" at the right of the driveway on to the farm.  This season, they stopped allowing cars to park along the drive to the back of the farm where the 2 other restaurants (Quiessence and Morning Glory Cafe).  Now when you come to visit The Kitchen, you have to park in the parking lot on the east side of 32nd street and walk across.once you enter into the Farm Kitchen, you are greeted with the aroma of some amazing baking or cooking.  It always smells so wonderful in there.  You will find some local food items in the store, even down to the locally made Poore Brother potatoe chips!  LOCAL LOCAL LOCAL.  Inside the Kitchen, you place your order from a menu that is loaded with your choice of sandwiches, salads, flavored teas, and soups.  They normally have an array of desserts to choose from as well.  I personally love the buttner squash creme brulee.Once you place your order, you go outside and wait for your number to be called.  Once your food is ready, you can choose to sit on the patio or venture over to the picnic tables or spread your own blanket and eat your food under the pecan trees.One thing of note;  you can schedule baby showers, et al with the kitchen.My personal favorites on this menu are:Tuscan Chicken SandwichItalian SandwichAny of their broth based soups.  Butternut Squash Creme BruleeChocolate Chip Cookies
Little Rangoon Taste of Burma=Rereading my post, I'm aware that my review may sound to be a negative one, but I want to make it clear that I did enjoy the flavors of the dishes I tried.  It was the less-than warm reception to the questions I had asked- a perception I haven't had in a VERY long time (all the venues I've been to for many months, a few years, even, have been quite accomodating), and the long wait times I encountered affected the tone of this review.  ---I've had this "Taste of Phoenix" giftcard (purchased through Costco) good at restaurants such as Tapino, Picazzo Gourmet Pizza, Medizona, and Little Rangoon since pre-Christmas, so I decided to go for my first LRvisit last Friday.  Alfred, who I later found out is one of the venue's two owners (found a business card w/ his name on it), showed me to one of the corner tables (there were two occupied tables indoors and a full table outdoors).  After food allergy issues were covered, I ordered the two items I spotted on the online menu beforehand- Chicken satay app and Dhal curry.  I was starving and was thankful for the complimentary fried wontons and questionary dipping sauce.  It looked somewhat akin to Chinese duck sauce and was sure to contain allergenic ingredients (Alfred didn't check on the info).  Though I was almost starving, I had to ask Alfred to take the plate away, even though 2/3 of the wonton chips remained.  Thankfully, the two menu items I ordered almost arrived simultaneously, albeit after what I thought was a long wait for an app dish and soup (15 minutes for homemade soup I can understand, but 15 minutes for an appetizer of four 4"x1" skewers of grilled chicken skewers?).  Though it wasn't as dark in the restaurant as my photos would lead you to believe, the somewhat fatty satay skewers didn't have that gorgeous caramelization I'm used to seeing in other venues and as such did not strike me as "grilled to perfection" as stated on the menu.  The serving temperature of the skewers also seemed closer to room temperature than straight from the grill, but at least I was able to eat these right away since the Dhal curry was so hot, I had to let it cool for at least ten minutes.  The paratha that accompanied the curry was nicely plump and flaky when it first arrived, and, fortunate for me, I tore a piece and tried it with the too-hot curry then and so was able to enjoy its flakiness.  After devouring the slightly luke-warm satay skewers, which were very good when paired with the DELICIOUS peanut sauce (although I found it visually off-putting), I turned my attention to the curry soup, which was still very hot, but was so tasty that I decided to plow ahead (an almost visual truth since I was hungry!).  The split pea and lentil soup was a satisfying meal, yet I was expecting a more viscous consistency, closer to hummus, although I cannot fathom why, since dhal/daal curries of Indian cuisine are also on the watery side (at least Pasand's and Udupi Cafe's were, as I recall).  The cooled paratha was disappointing at this point since the flakiness was almost nonexistent, and the bread's texture was now almost pasty.  Should I order the dhal curry dish again, I'll have to ask that the paratha be brought out after the soup's cooled for a few minutes.I hope to visit soon for lunch where I hope I'll be able to give a higher rating.  In the meantime, please enjoy the pics I've included!  :)  Be warned- it took at least fifteen minutes for my check to arrive, despite the fact there were only three or four tables occupied at any given time (around ten people or under that).  Thought I'd also mention that while the take-out menu only indicated two dessert items (Sanwin Makin and Mango-coconut pudding), the server did show me a menu with many intriguing gelato desserts ranging from $3 scoops to $5-$8 sundaes and other creations!  Since I had the impression that Alfred didn't appreciate the food allergy questions I posed to him earlier, I wasn't in the mood to go into more detail with the gelatos' ingredients.  'Twas a shame, since my sweet tooth was raging after having consumed the spicy curry soup.Saturday night.Date night."Let's try somewhere new," I suggest to my man... and alas, he agrees!Ten minutes later, we find ourselves sitting in Little Rangoon.  We're the only ones in the place aside from the staff.  We probably would've left had it not been for the "People Love Us On Yelp" sticker on the door and Alfred, the friendly owner who was also our waiter...Jared not only agreed to go somewhere new but he allowed me to do the ordering.  The first dish that caught my eye was some sort of vegetarian dish that Alfred said people either love it or hate it.  He wasn't trying too hard to sell it, so we went with some more common (at least to us) choices from the menu:  spring rolls (the kind that are not fried) with chicken, a noodle dish similar to a pad seu eu, and a vegetable dish with tofu that we added okra to.  (I love okra!)Unfortunately, the chicken in the spring rolls was rubbery and kind of gross... and the vegetable dish was covered in a really oily sauce that lacked flavor.  I'd probably give this place two stars, but Alfred was nice enough and they serve okra - huge props for that.  Even so, the meal was pricey for what we had... and I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.  I hope it was an off night for their sake.  And now, because of our so-so / not fantastic experience, I am pretty sure I will not be allowed to choose the date night restaurant for a while... :(
Fresh Mint=Pretty darn amazing for a vegetarian menu! The owner was super friendly and I told her how much I love spicy fare.. she took care of me!!I ordered the Kung Pao Soy Chicken.. you don't even miss the chicken at all.. nice and spicy sweet with LOADS of veggies!! Also ordered the Imperial Roll Noodles.. yummy! I didn't even miss the BBQ pork that usually comes with this dish elsewhere. Lots of pieces of egg rolls amongst fresh cabbage and rice noodles.. she also threw in some Thai chiles.. my mouth, my mouth, my mouth is on fire! Can't wait go come back!!I'll admit... the thought of going to a vegan restaurant was a little scary for me. I'm no vegetarian, and a meal without a little meat just doesn't seem like a full meal. In fact going into Fresh Mint, we even made provisions to do a post-meal In-n-Out burger trip just to get our meat fix in for the night. As it turns out, we didn't need to make our 'meat run'... this vegan food is rockin! We got the kung pao soy chicken and a pad thai... both were very tasty. My soy chicken was so flavorful that if I wouldn't have known any better I'd have thought it was real chicken. The stand out here was the flavor... each dish seemed pretty perfectly seasoned; not too spicy but not too bland either. A lot of character and distinct tastes, which is always good. Service was pretty good, but nothing amazing. One funny thing that happened, and I don't know if this is a nightly thing or not... but they gave us a stuffed animal when we paid (weird lookin' thing). The guy that gave it to us actually said 'Guys get the check, girls get a doll'. Odd. Pretty solid place, although for the setting/decor it does seem a tad pricier than it should be. Give this place a shot!First off, let's give some praise to the concept: A vegan, vietnamese-style, Kosher restaurant? That's the coolest thing I've heard since someone explained nonstick frying pans to me. Unfortunately, the service can be a bit slow, and a bit weird, but you've got to give them some credit for opening a place like this.Most of the dishes are composed of rice/noodles, steamed veggies, and one of their vegan meats like chicken, beef, ribs, fish, etc., doused in sauce. It's awesome sauce (saucesome?) but it pretty much negates a lot of the healthier aspects of the dish. Why not wait to add those extra calories with some vegan carrot or chocolate cake instead? As far as recommendations, the lemongrass tofu rolls and green papaya salad are both light, filling and fresh tasting dishes. If you're a sauce-o-holic, opt for the tasty BBQ citrus spare ribs or soy fish in a clay pot.....For those of you who don't want to read any of that, refer to the short & sweet version below:Concept: hell yeah.Service: weird.Selection of "meat": awesome.Vegan desserts: much appreciated.Dishes: varied & satisfactory.Sauces: too heavy.Overall: 3.5 stars. I'll probably go back at some point.Eek! Methinks not, indeed!Okay, I never usually give a place a 1 star because I have this moral dilemma with it... BUT, I also never usually walk out of a restaurant. So, I walked in, was awkwardly greeted, and told to have a seat. It was lunch time, so the place was full, but not overflowing with stressed out customers. In all honesty, it was a typical lunchtime scenario inside. *I'd also like to note that I read reviews for slower than average service, so I was prepared to wait a little extra to try the food*Once I sat down, I noticed the server bringing menus over to the patrons that entered immediately before me, but he never came over with one for me. I decided to patiently wait for the next five minutes. That's when I started overhearing the conversation at the table next to me, and to sum it up:I don't know if we can stay and eat, we might have to get it to go.. We've been waiting a long time.Again, that's not verbatim, but it's exactly along those lines. I figured the reviews were right about the food prep times, and continued to wait. After a few more minutes passed by, another couple walked in, were acknowledged and seated, and after a minute, they were given menus (This is about 8-10 minutes in). It was then that the server came over with water for the first couple that had walked in before me. He then walked back to the drink area and brought out two more glasses of water for the couple that came in almost ten minutes after me. With no menu, water or sense of appreciation for wanting to spend my money at Fresh Mint, I got up and walked out.A good way to lose a customer is to not serve them. With service complaints since 2008 on Yelp, I really think something needs to be done. That was unbelievably insulting.
Pita Jungle=Beep, beep, beep.   No that sound isn't coming from a big truck backing up, it's from the wheelbarrow that they use to bring your food out on.  I swear, my portion was stupidly huge.  I had the Medchilada, ---Grilled chicken and mixed beans in lavosh bread, topped with cheddar and wood-fired. Served with brown rice, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, pico de gallo and sour cream.   It was hanging over the sides of the platter and easily was over 5000 calories and I couldn't eat a quarter of it.I looked over at the diner next to me and saw the largest fruit salad ever created.  IMHO, it should have been served in a bucket.  I'm guessing there were 4 bananas, 2 pints of strawberries, 1 bunch of grapes and a full melon in it. I really like the food at all the Pita Jungles, but damn some of their portions are way out of line.Good god I love Pita Jungle. Go there, eat, drink, be happy. The food is varied & fantastic, the service is good, the place is interesting.
Pullman=This is a super cool wine bar, but expensive for the area it's in considering it's near McGill campus. However I went here with my mom and discovered it was the perfect atmosphere for all ages! Perfect for more of an upscale date but also nice for a place to relax before and/or after a dinner. The cheese plate is delicious but like any wine bar like this one it doesn't contain enough cheese for the price. There's a large variety of wines available dating way back but for our budget we chose the cheapest red wine available, but it was still deliciousAh, a wine bar. Plus tapas! When I see either one of these categories I get very excited, so when they're combined you know I'm happy as a clam. On my last day of vacation, while Adam was executing the "business" portion of our trip, I chose Pullman as our final restaurant stop together. I'm totally happy with the decision and I'd definitely return.First of all, Pullman is in a great location that was walking distance from our downtown hotel (right next to the amazing La Crepe 2 Go, which I'll review soon). The atmosphere is very chic and sexy. There's a gorgeous, sparkling, ornate chandelier right as you walk in, and there are many small tables and a little bar. We didn't go upstairs (but it looked fabulous up there like the rest of the restaurant) - we walked down a little half staircase to our own tiny table. And I mean tiny... Adam even had to share a stool with the person behind him. It was meant to be shared, of course, but it's just super close quarters. We had trouble fitting our food, plates, silverware, wine, and water on our table since it was literally like a 2X2 foot square. It was really lovely though - with only a little light from a single candle. Romantic and cozy.Our waiter did a great job talking about the wine and making recommendations. You can get little 2 oz pours of several wines for $4.5-$7 CAD each, a 4 oz glass for $8-$15ish, and a flight of three 2 oz pours for $22ish. We stuck with a regular 4 oz glass, and our favorite was a white from Slovenia. We mentioned to the waiter that we're not picky about wine as long as it isn't sweet, and he told us "there's no sweet wine on our menu." Well, good!For dinner we had the cheese board, the charcuterie board, and the Piri Piri short ribs. Ohhhhh man, I was in heaven. There were 4 very different and beautiful cheeses paired with 4 accompaniments (pureed fig, apple, some other kind of fruit jelly thing, and a walnut paste). The charcuterie board was AMAZING with 2 incredible sausages, prosciutto, duck, pate, a mustard cream sauce, grapes, and cornichons. The piri piri short ribs were phenomenal - the sauce was super spicy, but not overbearing. Nice portions and plenty of food to share on each plate. Plus, these tapas are definitely affordable. I'd say most items were between $8-$12. Beautiful meal and setting all around.
Sandbar Mexican Grill=Friday night, meting a several friends for a drink. They had a live bad and the weather was great. That was the good of it. The server, while nice, was slooow and the drinks were weeeeak. The prices are average, which makes a bad combo. Once the band stopped and the house music started it pretty much killed the fun. Was not a fan of the food last time but neglected to eat this time.
Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant=Something about this place always told me to stay far, far away. But by all rights, all of us should try every Italian restaurant around, because someone, somewhere, must be nailing "Italian Restaurant", the triple-Axel of the culinary business. I just haven't found them yet.I should have listened to my impulse to stay away, but my wife has been wanting to try this place for years. For some reason we thought we would forgo some risk by using the To Go service and ordering online. Nay, the problems this place has pervade all its crevices. all the way out to the parking lot.I ordered some junk online: A small Caesar Salad, a Small Quattro al Forno, and a Small Eggplant Parmesan. It would be ready from 5:00-5:15pm. I got there at about 4:50 and a friendly lady came out right away and gave me the bill to sign. She said my food was "not quite done". Fine, cool, whatever. I was early. I could wait a few.A half hour later, it would dawn on me that "not quite done" in restaurant parlance actually means "We haven't started cooking your food." After I watched numerous people park at the To Go window and leave with their food, the harried lady finally came back out with my stuff, explaining that "they had to cut more eggplant". Ah, the mysterious "they" and their lack of kitchen management skills. An order for eggplant comes in online at 4:30.. why cut up any eggplant? Silly.I got home and discovered that the rest of my order had apparently been sitting around while the eggplant dish was prepared. The eggplant was moderately hot -- however, the Quattro al Forno was room temperature and so was the salad. The eggplant was way too thin and not seasoned well, and featured chunks of uneven Parmesan that had clearly been cut instead of grated. The Quattro al Forno might have been good when it was designed to be served, but its temperature made me quesy.When all was said and done, I realized that I'd consumed passable Italian food at quite a premium price with poor service to go with it. I felt full of lukewarm food and disappointed, which is really a strange sensation. I'm sure this place has its moments when it's hitting on all cylinders, but it ain't Sunday at 5pm.I held my company Christmas party here over the weekend and it was a wonderful experience.  From the moment I requested information on holiday parties back in September and was responded to immediately by the Sales Manager, Rebecca; to the moment I walked in for the actual party and was escorted to our private event room the whole experience was efficient, friendly and professional.Our party went smoothly, the food was delicious, the cocktails (with the exception of the mojito, which seemed to be mixed in an 'unusual' way) were very good, and the servers assigned to us, Jordan and another young man (who's name I didn't catch), were very efficient and friendly.  I will not hesitate to hold another event here.  I was really very pleased.I came to Buca with some co-workers for a job well done celebration. I'm not a real fan of chain Italian restaurants, but Buca is different with the atmosphere, being able to handle large parties, and if course family-style dining. We were seated in the Pope room which is fun but little freaky. Pictures of the Pope all over with a head of the Pope on the middle of the table and the Pope chair. Strange but cool having the Pope watch you eat. We started off by having the Mozzarella Garlic bread which was really good, the Chopped Antipasto salad, and the Apple Gorgonzola salad. The salads were pretty good not great but I thought it had a little too much vinegar for my liking. We had the Margherita pizza with fresh mozzarella which I thought was very good, Chianti Braised Short Ribs where they gave us three huge ribs that were boneless and covered in gravy which was very tender and very good. We couldn't have ribs without Rosemary Potatoes (meat & potatoes kind of guy) and they were really tasty and cooked perfectly. To top it off we had the Macaroni Rosa that had macaroni (of course) with a creamy sauce and chicken, broccoli and peas. It was really good. We ate it all up and had very little leftovers so that tells you the food was pretty good. No one seemed to be holding back. We can't forget about desert so we had the Dolce Platter which included Tiramisu, Double Dark Chocolate cake, Cheese cake, and Apple Crostata. The deserts were fantastic. Really good and everyone enjoyed it. The service was right on. Filling up our water glasses, beer, wine, ice tea, and soft drinks. Food came out in a timely manner too. So I have no complaints about the service. So overall, I had a very good meal with lots of variety of food and massive amounts to fill up everyone. Coming here is about having a fun time and good Italian food. So enjoy, eat up but don't forget to unbuckle that belt after you eat all that food.
McKoy's Smokehouse & Saloon=ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?  I have lived in Charlotte for 3 1/2 years and only ate here for the first time tonight?  I apologize to my tastebuds.  Pulled pork, ribs, pot roast, chicken.....each one had an incredible smokey flavor and were cooked just perfectly.  I can't get over how excellent those ribs were....great bark on them, not too cooked down but not too tough either.  Green beans and mac'n cheese were excellent as well. Even got dessert...best coconut pie and pecan pie i have ever eaten.  You can tell it was homemmade! Service was great, atmosphere was fun. Do yourself a favor and stop going to Mac's and make this place your go to (don't forget about Bobbee O's in Northlake too though because they still have the best brisket around).This place serves the best pot roast you can buy in Charlotte. I put off trying this place because they don't serve brisket and while I like pulled pork I don't have the same love affair with it to begin with as I do with some nice juicy beef. Based on the reviews from other Yelpers I decided to go one evening after work to try this famous pot roast and I am now hooked.We were enthusiastically greeted upon entering and led straight to a table. I ordered a $4 mango mojito which was promptly served and it was as sweet as it was refreshing. Since we were basically starving upon arrival we ordered the appetizer sampler. In hindsight this was too ambitious for just the two of us since we were ordering full diners as well. The nachos and potato skins were delicious and the establishment did not skimp on the cheese. I loved the chicken fingers which were juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I am not huge on bone in wings but my dining companion said they were excellent. I ordered a soup as one of my fixin's, and it came out before the entrees as requested. It was potato and bacon and super creamy and filling. This could have easily served as an appetizer to hold me over until dinner.When the mains came (we both opted for pot roast) I saw the soup again and when the waitress saw she remembered that I already had the soup brought out but shrugged and said that I get two soups today. This was totally okay with me - free food is one of my favorite things. The pot roast was completely tender. There was some fat to pick around but the generous portion made me feel like I wasn't being skimped on. They must cook this roast for hours to get the beef so tender. The darker sauce (not sure what it was called, not vinegar based) that was at our table was a great compliment to the pot roast. Overall both the food and service were great and I will definitely be back! PS - the leftover pot roast made for great sandwiches the next day.
Islamorada Fish Company=This place is pretty cool! Its inside Bass Pro Shop, which you think at first is kind of weird and would be really small, NO not at all! Bass Pro shop is huge and this restaurant is also. When you first walk in you can see a large fish tank that separates the front room dinning area and bar from the back dinning room. Once you get around the bar and the beautifully large fish tank, the restaurant opens up into a large dinning area. The celling is very high and the space in there is just so opening and welcoming. The decorations with the fish on the walls, the tables, the large fireplace in the middle of the dinning area, the paint, the fish tank..... it all works perfectly together to create an outdoor ambiance, with a lot of class and openness! I really loved the way they have this restaurant set up, its beautiful!Ok onto the food! We received an order of I believe sugar glazed bread when we ordered our drinks! Oh my goodness this bread is delicious. The sugar on the top gives the bread a little extra mmmmmm. It might just be me because I cant eat a lot of bread due to my gluten intolerance, but I had to have at least 1 piece! They have a great spread of different kinds of meals, from chicken, to sea food, to steaks to alligator! YES I said alligator! I have never had alligator before, so of course it was one of the appetizers I ordered just to give it a whirl! The best way to describe the breaded alligator, is that it has a shrimp texture, with a chicken tenderness to it. So its a mix of shrimp and chicken. It doesn't have a weird taste or bite to it at all. The sauce that was served with the alligator actually really played with the flavor well! It created a nice little extra bite to the gator to give it more flavor. For my main dish I had the shrimp pasta. The alfredo sauce was different, and really blended with the shrimp well. It was nice to have a dish with large pieces of shrimp to eat and not little bite sized shrimp. My friend ordered the cajun chicken pasta. This dish was served with the same alfredo sauce as mine but with the cajun taste instead of shrimp. I have to say his chicken was spiced deliciously and I enjoyed his plate much more than mine. The combination of the cajun spices along with the alfredo sauce made a great dish!The staff here was incredibly friendly, our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful when we asked about he alligator dish, the manager came and checked on our dishes as we were eating and everyone wished us a nice goodbye as we left! I like going to places like this, being surrounded by friendly people who enjoy their job and having a great meal, its just a great way to start off a good Sunday funday!
Dragon Wok=As you can see, I'm writing a lot of reviews these days because this is my last month on Yelp. Before I split, I wanna give credit to some of the unsung and under-appreciated small businesses in the NW area. DRAGON WOK is one of the better Chinese places that I have eaten at in Las Vegas. And I believe it's even better than most places on Spring Mountain. Summerlin/NW does not have many traditional style Asian restaurants. But places like DRAGON WOK are the closest you will ever get. This is not a generic panda express-like joint where food just sits out in a warmer. They cook it when you order it. They got amazing noodles here and the Orange Beef is also really great! I know that I get a lot of criticism from other Yelpers about how I tend to give "free" 5-star reviews out if the restaurant is operated by an Asian-American. Maybe some of that is true, but you need to realize that I am a 4th generation Asian-American whose family were direct survivors of the internment.  I'm always going to support Asian-American owned small business. But, DRAGON WOK does deserve every star I give it.
Yard House Town Square=An all-inclusive place to hang out, eat, drink, and watch the latest sports on their multiple TVs!  With it being Vegas, no dress code or cover charge means it will be very popular!Walking in on a Saturday night, expect a wait of at least an hour because that's how long we waited for our party of four.  Call ahead to get yourself on the list since they don't take reservations for parties less than 10!  If you're lucky, you can squeeze yourself over by the bar and try one of their 100 to 250 beers on tap.  They say they do offer the "World's Largest Selection of Draft Beer."  You can order it by the pint or half yard, but watch out if you break the half yard glass; it'll cost you an extra $10!  But if you want a sampling, request their six-pack.  It's a weekly rotating variety of six different beers so you can get a taste of each.The best seats are in the booths, which can fit five comfortably.  The tables in the middle are for the big parties, but you're constantly being bumped into as people and staff attempt to squeeze on by.We went for a variety of appetizers to share:* Grilled Jamaican Wings: "tossed in jerk spices with rum bbq sauce" $10.25 - A generous amount of wings, but not enough of that sauce.  Full of flavor though and tasty!* Firecracker Wings: "tossed in a spicy sesame garlic plum glaze" $10.25 - Favored over the Jamaican wings because of the spice kicker.* Grilled Hearts of Romaine: "topped with red onions, candied walnuts and a gorgonzola champagne vinaigrette" $8.95 - Good enough to share with really nice walnuts and yummy dressing.  Even the guys in our group were fighting over it!* Baby Leaf Spinach: "portabella mushrooms, red onions, smoked gouda, tomatoes, croutons, and balsamic vinaigrette" $7.95 - Not enough portabella mushrooms, but I like the Gouda.* Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip: "main lobster, blue crab and artichoke hearts baked with a four cheese blend served with tortilla chips and grilled flat bread" $11.45 - Good dip, but not the most popular dish we ordered.* Barnaise Sliders: "four mini burgers made from Naturewell Natural Angus Beef served with fried onions, barnaise sauce, fries and pickle $9.95 - The fried onions make it taste really good, although the side of barnaise sauce sure doesn't hurt.  Even the thin fries taste good!* Classic Sliders: "four mini burgers made from Naturewell Natural Angus Beef served with cheddar cheese, our house special sauce, fries and pickle" $9.95 - Only okay after you try the Barnaise ones, stick to that one instead.  * Fresh Baked Brownie: "topped with mint chocolate chip, caramel or vanilla ice cream" $7.95 - Takes about fifteen minutes and meant for sharing.* Draft Beer Float: "Lindeman's Framboise with vanilla ice cream" $6.50 - Like a root beer float, but with Lindeman's.They do offer regular entrees like sandwiches, steaks, burgers, chicken, pizza, and seafood.  There's bound to be something on the menu for everyone, which makes this place a good choice.  The noise level is over the top though and you'll find yourself screaming to be heard.  (Not exactly the best place for a date if you're sitting across from each other.  But a good place to check out people and possibly make some new friends.  We ran into quite a few people we knew that Saturday night, so it's definitely a hopping place!)Since I'm still not a beer drinker, I like the Yard House because they serve up Lindeman's ($8, in a goblet) and Wyder's.  I can drink something I enjoy while everyone else is having their rounds of beer.They do offer Happy Hours: Monday through Friday, 3 pm to 6 pm; Sunday through Wednesday, 11 pm to close. Select appetizers are half-priced and drinks are discounted.  After 11 pm on Friday and Saturday nights, it's 21 years and older.  The crowd does change a bit and the skirts become shorter.  There's even a line outside by then, so come in earlier and get yourself acquainted at the bar.This place is kid-friendly since they do offer a kids' menu and their "Kids Klub."  But you probably don't want to take them here on weekend nights.Update! 05/31/08 - This time tried their (Mac & Cheese)2 "roasted chicken breast, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and parmesan cheese with castellane pasta and white truffle oil."  Next time, I'm going to skip the chicken because it's dried out.  But so yummy though when you get past the poultry part.A recent visit to celebrate a friend's birthday, Yard House left me feeling disappointed.  We had a large party, about 14 people at the table.  During our visit, we even had a shift change, where our original waitress was kind enough to let us know she was leaving and who was taking over.  Although the rest of our table had appetizers, The Husband and I arrived in time for entrees:* New York Steak Salad "green beans, roasted peppers, avocado, crispy potatoes, red onion and baby lettuce tossed in a gorgonzola vinaigrette with beefsteak tomatoes and pickled egg" ($16.95) - A generous and flavorful salad, loaded with the ingredients listed and a tasty steak.* Cuban Roast Pork Dip "tomatoes, pepper jack cheese, pickles, dijon and garlic aioli on french bread grilled with bbq au jus" ($12.65) - This was The Husband's order and I had a bite.  It wasn't that great, especially when I recall my previous experience with a Cuban sandwich.  The fries were good though.My concern was more with service.  The waiter asked the birthday girl what kind of dessert she wanted (out of three choices), and she went for the Chocolate Souffle Cake "mini serving with vanilla ice cream, served warm".  When it arrived, there was no candle which surprised us all.  (How are you supposed to sing happy birthday without a candle to blow?)  And he only gave us one spoon, which reminded me that he never brought back dessert menus for the rest of us.  At this point, we didn't bother ordering dessert since the birthday girl already had hers.  That part made the experience disappointing.The other waiter was able to do a split tender on the check, which was helpful.  (Although he put the costs wrong on my receipt, oh well.)  I usually think Yard House is on top of things, but I guess they weren't that night.Until last night's visit to the Yardhouse I was a big fan....now, I'm not so sure, here's why.A good friend and his fiance were visiting from California and wanted to get together for dinner & drinks.  Since Town Square is located on the Strip, it was a convenient place for us to meet.  Over the past few weeks I've been drinking a lot of IPA's and Chimay and was telling him that the Yardhouse would be a great place for him to give them a try.  Since they don't have a Yardhouse where he lives in California, we were all very excited.The Better Half and I met them at the Yardhouse.  It was pretty packed for a Sunday evening but we were able to find 4 spots at the bar in the corner so we could face each other and get seated immediately.  After browsing the beer menu, we decided on a Stone IPA.....the bartender said they no longer had it.  Ok, how about the Long Hammer IPA?  Nope...no longer carry it.  He proceeded to tell me they only had 1 or 2 of the IPA's on the menu because they are in the process of switching out the menu......what?  WTF is that?  I understand changing out the menu, but not being able to offer what you have listed until you make the change.....that's BS!  Especially for a place that claims to have 100's of beers on tap!  Ok.....well, if that's the case we asked for a Chimay Triple....guess what?  They didn't have any!At this point I was a little embarrassed because I hyped up this place as a solid "go to" place to enjoy new brews and good food.  We settled for a Ranger IPA and called it a day.For food we ordered Hot Wings, 4 Cheese Pizza, Jambalaya, and Sliders.  The Pizza was very soggy, even though I ordered it well done....that's the second time we've had Pizza and it come out soggy....we won't order it again.  The rest of the food was good, but not great.Overall, it was a disappointing night at the Yardhouse.  There are tons of places in Vegas that serve good bar food, but came here specifically for beers that were not available....and that's suppose to set them apart from the rest.  I hope this was an anomaly and not the beginning of a trend.Okay, there are a few things that are going to be brought up and I'm almost guaranteed to get a manager comment on this, but whatever, it's happening.Went here last night to try the Gardein line here. I was very excited to see that vegan meats have been added to some of their dishes. How cool is that?? But upon doing some internet research before we ordered, I found out that due to cooking methods, ALL of the dishes wouldn't be vegan OR vegetarian. They cook everything on the same grill as the meat. What sense does this make? None. It's like having a black coat and putting bleach all over it - it doesn't resemble a black coat anymore and is tainted. If you mix vegan food with meat, what is the point? And here comes why it is 2-star. IT IS NOT STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR THE VEG*N MENU TO BE COOKED IN A SEPARATE PAN. You have to go out of your way to ask for this, and even then a manager comes out to explain that it's not going to taste the same as if it were on the grill. Hmm - do you really think a vegan WANTS dead cow mixed in with her food? HELL NO. Granted, Yardhouse has already taken *some* action and put a little dot next to a few items that absolutely will come in contact with meat since these items are fried and have to go in the same basket as everything else. But they haven't specified that ALL the menu items will come in contact with animal products which is not okay. It would be really helpful if people who come here know this right off the bat. If I hadn't had my phone on me that night, I literally would have gotten sick since I haven't had any sort of meat in 6 years. Here's what I would suggest: just like other companies before you (Chipotle comes to mind), please automatically make all the vegetarian/Gardein items cooked separately from the meat. You don't want a lawsuit a la McDonald's. It is ridiculous that these vegan meats come to you and then you cross-contaminate them with animal sources to make them not even vegetarian. Oh and this isn't just for this Yardhouse, it goes for all of them - trust me, I will be contacting your corporate offices today. Also, it would be nice if you could put a little V next to the items that could be made vegan or are vegan on the menu. Makes ordering easier, and the confusion of your staff minimal.Anyways, I ordered the veggie sliders that come with fries, and we also ordered a side of sweet potato fries. Matt ordered a thai "chicken" pizza. After some back and forth, the sliders couldn't even go on the bread (only the wheat bread is vegan) so I got them protein style, wrapped in lettuce. The sweet potato fries we got as our appetizer were severely lackluster. Very bland, no taste, no toppings like sugar or anything. We couldn't have the sauce since it contained bacon, so I guess that's where all the flavor is. After the aforementioned back and forth with the wait staff, we got our food. Do they seriously only have the meat and the bun (in my case, lettuce) for the sliders? NOTHING else? No tomato or onion or even ketchup and mustard? For serious? The taste of the Gardein patty was wonderful, but for almost $11 for plain patties is ridiculous. The fries were way better than the sweet potato ones, but it just wasn't worth the price. I wish they would have suggested to make my order a veggie burger since that's essentially what they did anyways, was cut the patty into four pieces and pass them off as sliders. At least then I could have had the wheat bun and toppings. It was very difficult throughout the night to try and signal our waitress. I know it was very busy and that I did ask a lot of questions and such, but she was an expert ninja. Not the best customer service in the world. I also unfortunately don't see this Gardein line lasting here at Yardhouse. Until cooking the items separately becomes standard procedure, I can see a lot of vexed veg*ns. Honestly, what is the point of having vegan meats if they're going to end up on the same grill as actual meats? I just don't get that logic. Yardhouse itself is a bit pricey and I understand this, but at least give the customer the most you can. Plain sliders are not okay. In fact, I don't think I've been anywhere that has completely bare sliders. Due to the lackluster food, the outrageous price tag and the lack of good customer service, Yardhouse really deserves a 1-star review but I still love that a chain has decided to put vegan faux meats on their menu. The intent is there, but the execution is awful but can be easily improved upon. I might be back since there were other items that looked appetizing, but only when I want to deal with the headaches and the hassle. Until then, I'll stock up on Gardein at Whole Foods and make my own delights at home.I have been here about 3 times in one month, but I never complained until now. My friends and I went there earlier in the day to have dinner, but when we were waiting for a table, there were about five hostess' waiting there and doing nothing. After about 5 mins we finally got seated. They knew we were there, but did nothing.Other than that small incident, food is incredible! Id have to say the ribeye steak, macaroni and cheese are some of my many favorites. I've also tried a couple salads which were yummy as well!!Been coming here for years. I always get the tomato bisque soup to start DELISH! its very light and creamy with a touch of basil and homemade croutons. for the entree i can never resist one of two items. 1) truffle mac and cheese 2) seared ahi dinner.Mac & Cheese- very cheesy/creamy, bits of bacon and a truffle glazeAhi- Seared Ahi drenched in a Chinese black bean sauce with crisp basil on a bed of brown rice.these items are a must try!And now for the fun part.... THE BEER! ***Young's Double Chocolate Stout- omg its desert in a glass.***Big Sky Moose Drool- a creamy, slightly hoppy beer you could pair it with anything***House Honey Blonde- the perfect summer beer. amazingly refreshing***Sam Adams Cherry Wheat-  The best Sam Adams has to offer! a bright cherry flavored wheat beer with a crisp finish.. DELISH!***Chimay Triple- slight raisin taste with a touch of hops.. yum! perfect before dinner beer.why only 3 stars? the bar service is terrible. this location and red rock.After and independent of a UYE, when I join my Yelp friends for socializing at the Yard House, it becomes the Yelp House. The Yard House is a fun place for groups of friends to hang out over beer and good food. The restaurant does a commendable job accommodating large groups. Both times that I went to the Yard House we had no problem getting a large table. The service is precise. And when it is time to pay, we had our own checks. Substitute Yelpers for a gathering of general friends, or a date and the Yard House is everybody's social house.  The Yard House is my choice chain restaurant for beer selection. The Yard House is to beer what Baskin Robbins is to ice cream. Whereas Baskin Robbins features 31 flavors of ice cream,, the Yard House features approximately 600 flavors of beer (I counted the beer listed in the menu). If I were to go to the Yard House one Friday a week to order a flavor of beer, according to my math it would take me 12 years to done this. Or if I were to go to the Yard House everyday to try a flavor of beer, it would take me 2 years to do this. Some of the beers may have been listed under a couple of different headings. The deal is that the Yard House selection of beer is as good as it gets.   There are eleven series of beer. There is the chalkboard series. The cider series is the seasonals. The light beer is less than 5.8% alcohol content. This series includes many of the name brands such as Michelob and Budweiser. There is the Honey Fruit series which includes BBC Strawberry Blonde and Blue Point Blueberry. There is the wheat series that includes Blue Hawaiin Hefeweizen. The Malty series includes Bass Ale and Alaskin Amber. The Dark series includes Big Sky Moose Drool and Bison Organic Chocolate. The bitter series includes Anchor Liberty and Blue Point Hoptical Illusion. And there is the Strong and Effervescent series. The menu lists the alcohol content. Unless I overlooked something, the Allagash Curieux is the strongest at 11% alcohol content. There are three sizes of beer. I went for the middle size which is the pint. For the record I greatly appreciated the Firestone.  This very Yard House features a Happy Hour and Late Night Specials. The Happy Hour is Monday-Friday 3-6 pm and Late Night Special Sunday-Wednesday 10-close. They include domestic pints from $4.25-$5.75, well drinks $4.27-$4.75 and wine by glass $2 off. If you are up to food there are half price appetizers & pizza.  The food is good but I've tasted better. My complaint about the roasted turkey club is that it was layers of sandwich instead of the sandwich I am accustomed to. The classic cheeseburger was a good choice. The fries are these skinny things that remind me of potato sticks. I feel that the Yard House ought to expand their fries selection to include steak fries and just thicker fries.  When I socialize at a restaurant, I am big on the music that is playing. I was won over by the music playing. I heard great music from Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones and classic rock era.  The Yard House excells at their selection of beer. Whether it is my Yelp House or social House I intend to return. When I return I plan to try the Blue Point Blueberry beer that is brewed in Blue Point, NY; 5 miles south of where I lived. Gotta be patriotic to my home town.Daniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 72Had a fantastic lunch/dinner here during their Happy Hour.   We were immediately seated and greeted by our server Seth.    He was outstanding during our entire dining visit. We had a few questions about different menu items and he was very informative and helpful!  Plus he had a great quirky personality that makes him a great waiter!Since it was Happy Hour, they have many 1/2 price appetizers and deals on drinks.  We decided to split the Chicken Nachos and Bearnaise Sliders.   This was a fantastic deal as our nachos ended up only being about 5.50 and the sliders were around 6.50.  The chicken nachos were delivered on a huge plate!  This plate alone would have actually been enough for both of our stomachs to be filled.  They had a great combination of ingredients with plenty of chicken spread throughout the nachos.  Fabulous! The sliders came out with 4 on the plate and a side of shoestring fries. I didn't see that fries were included so that was a bonus.  Plus I love shoestring style french fries.  Yum.  The sliders were just ok.  I almost wish we ordered the classic style sliders.  Yes I did love the bearnaise sauce that accompanied the sliders on the side but the burger itself was very plain.  It still enjoyed them.  Their dining area itself is spacious and roomy.  There are plenty of seating inside and on their outdoor patio.  Everything was kept very clean and tidy! It doesn't hurt to see their keg room when you first walk in...  puts a smile on my husbands face!  It is a great place whether you are visiting or a local.This place is always crowded when I go. Even after happy hour has ended during the middle of the week!  So if you are planning a get together, call ahead and make a reservation. Even then, there might still be some additional wait time for the tables to be cleaned up and reset for your party.The biggest draw for hitting up Yard House is probably their beer selection.  Because the food is just alright overall with highlights here and there that I have discovered. For arranging parties when you don't know where else to go, Yard House is a safe bet.  Everyone in Vegas that goes out even occasionally will know about it.Love watching sports and paling around with friends or near by strangers?  This is a good spot, if you are willing to wait for an open table or vacant chair at the bar.  There are plenty of flat screens to occupy your attention.Looking for a quiet intimate and relaxing place to chill and grab a bite?  The noise alone will get this place crossed off the list.  But you are also not going to be spending the kind of money you would expect to pay at a restaurant with nice tablecloth and illuminated by real candle lights.The service is okay to way above average.  What I do love about coming here with a large party is that the waitstaff has been trained to keep track of who ordered what, so splitting the bill at the end of the night is as painless and effortless on the customer's part as it is going to get.  Uber kudos for that alone!I would almost give this place a 4 stars, but for that to happen the food has to be better.I've enjoyed Yardhouse in the past, however, my most recent encounter with one of the managers, Leo, has really affected my overall experience and opinion of this restaurant. Leo informed my group of friends sitting at the bar that one of my friends would have to leave if she couldn't sit still. It was her birthday and I will be the first to admit she was slightly intoxicated... I would understand if my friend spilled a drink, broke a glass, screamed obnoxiously, or literally fell over in her chair which she did not. She. Did. Nothing.My friend was a little tipsy and the manager was quick to judge. I understand that if someone at a bar seems intoxicated it is a liability issue, however, I feel there could have been more professional and polite verbiage used to relay that message. This was not the the case. Leo was cold and came off rude. The group I was with were all surprised and shocked because as I said earlier, the friend we were with by no means was acting obnoxious or creating a scene. I asked for the man's name who happened to be the manager and he told me it was Leo. He also tried to grab his business card and realized he didn't have one with him. He didn't offer to retrieve one for me either.... I get it. Working in the restaurant industry I know there are a lot of difficult and intoxicated guests to deal with (I've been a server back in the day myself) however, there is also a thing called empathy and delivery which goes a long way. I don't work in the restaurant industry anymore but I do work in guest service management. The manager could have asked politely what he would have liked to occur, but that didn't happen. I hope Yardhouse management improves because I actually really liked that place. My interaction with Leo really bothered me (still does). Mitch, a bartender working at the time tried to defend Leo and didn't show empathy as well. He event spelt his name out for me because he was very confident in defending why I was wrong to feel offended with my interaction with Leo. Not sure if Mitch understands what the interaction consisted of. He sure was quick to make me feel like I was in the wrong.Unfortunately this recent experience has really affected my overall experience with Yardhouse. I will not be recommending anyone to this restaurant nor I will be returning. Being a large chain as they are I hope they improve in customer service to retain some loyal business.My 1st time at this Yard House location and had a great time! I've been to the LINQ location twice and Red Rock location several dozen times and I liked this Town Square location the best.The outdoor patio offered an excellent ambiance with impeccable service by Rob, a week ago Saturday night. The draft beer and cider selection are abundant, tasty and intoxicating! The baseball game was on nearby TVs within eyesight for those with glasses, contacts and/or previous Lasik surgery patients. I suppose people watching would be entertaining from the outdoor patio gazing off into Town Square, however I was focused on great conversation while sharing many laughs :-)I look forward to returning again soon while the weather has finally cooled.YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #233
Shane's Rib Shack=So in my quest for a new lunch spot, I dragged my co-worker and his wife to Shane's. We were greeted at the counter and the menu was so big, we had to step aside to read it all. We finally were ready to order our lunch!I opted for the Shack Sampler which comes with: 1/4 rack of ribs, 2 chicken tenders & 1/4 lb. pulled pork with 2 sides. I chose greens and macaroni and cheese. All this was delivered to my table!The food was pretty darn OK! The ribs were falling off the bone, and the sauce wasn't too terribly candy sweet. The chicken tenders were well seasoned and tossed in a hot wing sauce that wasn't very hot. The pulled pork was moist and tender and covered in the same sauce as the ribs. The greens were meh... they were sweet! Something I'm not used to. I was hoping for something more smoky/salty. The macaroni and cheese was not the kind that "Big Mama" used to make. It was tasty, but not homemade.I was delighted to see that they have Sweet Tea!!! Yay! That was a major plus for them. I wanted to try their peach cobbler so I went back up to the counter to order some. OK, I know some people are going to disagree with me, but I LOVE my cobbler doughy. Here's the catch, the dough has to be tasty. Shane's won on that tip too! I loved that the peaches weren't too terribly sweet, and there was a good amount of dough in the bowl. I plan on hitting up Shane's again for another "semi-southern" fix. It wasn't WONDERFUL it was "A-OK". If you want WONDERFUL, you'll have to hit my parent's kitchen in Spring, Texas. In the meantime, hit Shane's for a taste!texas toast with bbq brisket or bbq pulled pork.. choice of side: mac and cheese. fries. baked beans. fried okra. corn on the cob.   oh the heartburn. oh the delicious heartburn. no jokes, this place is great. they have free wifi, too. my inner nerd was greasy and pleased.
Z'Tejas Southwestern Grill=This location is extremely 'group friendly.'  I just made up that term, but it's true... I've been to this Z a handful of times with large groups and I've never been disappointed.  Maybe it's because it's a central location and they've got a private lot for parking... or perhaps it's because of those chambord margaritas? or is it the chips and salsa? or the cornbread?  Whatever the reason, I'm giving this Z a 4 star review because of previous good meals and for the excellent service we had tonight.I called in the afternoon and had no problem getting a reservation.  Julie who answered the phone was really sweet (always a good sign), and Matt, our server, was extremely personable and attentive.  We had a group of 8 - including a few picky eaters.  We started with chips (which are house-made) and salsa, guacamole, and grilled shrimp & guacamole tostada bites... On top of that, the GM brought us over the beef tostadas and shrimp & pork dumplings - this was a very sweet gesture and much appreciated - we finished every last bite of both!  The dumplings were cooked to a golden brown and really tasty.  The beef tostadas were yummy also; I think these are both new menu items that are being tested - hopefully they will stay since they were both pretty impressive!After sampling all of that, I still somehow managed to eat my dinner salad with a light lime vinagrette dressing; it was good but nothing special.  (Nothing like their Achiote Chicken Chopped Salad which is my favorite menu item to order when I go to Z for lunch)... And then my 'Grilled Miso Salmon' entree - actually, not as good as I remembered, but tasty nonetheless... other entrees at our table included the halibut special, blackened tuna, porcupine shrimp, seafood enchiladas, and a couple of entree salads.  Everyone was happy and left full - and for just over $30 a head including tip... not bad!I'll be back to visit this Z again soon for sure... it's a safe bet no matter your reasons, and it's great for groups!  Word of caution: be careful with the chambord margaritas - they dangerously good!Z'Tejas is quickly becoming one of our top "go to" breakfast places in town. They've got reasonable prices, the service is always great, and the best part of all is that they've got an amazing brunch menu...and don't even get me started on the cornbread.  It really is like having an extra little meal on the side and it's some of the best cornbread I've ever had the pleasure of slathering butter on and shoving down the gullet. Oh...and did I mention it's free with every meal? Yeah...makes us wanna high five the waitress each time we go there.A few of our favorite items on the brunch menu are the breakfast quesadilla, bananas foster french toast (very sweet), and eggs benedict.  We also make sure to get the chips and salsa trio with any meal here since their chips are always nice and fresh like they just came out of the oven (or wherever fresh chips come from).  There aren't a ton of items on the brunch menu, but it suffices and never leaves us dissapointed. The combo of good food and good service here should be the gold standard for chain restaurants...Z'Tejas knows its shit...they have fresh/fun food, and they have wait staff that are personable and always seem enthusiastic about the menu...can't ask for more than that. The only reason Z'Tejas isn't 5 stars is because is doesn't have that jaw dropping 'wow' factor with any of the dishes we've tried yet...it does have the "mmm...that's realllly good" factor going on...but not quite the "Arrrrgggh, I'm gonna have a seizure from overloading my taste buds with too much pleasure" factor. Still...a great place. 4/5.
City Tavern=While waiting for work to be done on our car at the nearby Best Buy, we wandered across to City Tavern to quench our thirst with a couple of beers. It was great that they had some locals on tap, including my favorite Captain Jack from OMB. We also shared an order of the lobster nachos, which were okay but not not as much quantity as I expected.Quiet on a mid-week afternoon centered between lunch and dinner but the service in the bar area (several TV's tuned to sports channels) was good.
Z-Cafe=Z-Cafe is a very cool little restaurant that serves up both Breakfast in the morning hours and a tasty Lunch during the rest of the day. They also have some really good looking Smoothies and fresh Cookies to enjoy.Just happened to find this place with my Yelp "nearby" button. I had the craving for a hot Sandwich and the photos got my stomach growling. Their PDF menu on the internet has all of the items they serve and it is very easy to navigate.Ordered the The Bloom Sandwich with Turkey, Bacon, Provolone, Cheddar, Avocado, Red Onion & Chipotle Sauce on Sourdough Bread with a side of their Homemade Potato Salad. It was very delicious and all of the ingredients were very fresh.They have several other cold and hot sandwiches as well as breakfast items in the morning There are also Soup and Salad options that can be ordered as a meal or they can be combined with a sandwich purchase.Service was very friendly and the place inside is very clean. I was very impressed with how important it was to them that my visit was both pleasant and expedient.Definitely will be back to try out some more of their yummy menu. The prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes are just right without going overboard and putting me into a food coma. SAMMY TIME!4 STARS
Maizie's Cafe & Bistro=I finally made it to Maizie's for lunch last Tuesday.  It was hopping, but my party of 2 got lucky and didn't have to wait for a table to open up.  We received a warm welcome and all of the staff including our waitress, Sarah, and Maizie herself went out of their way to make sure we were happy with our experience.  This place defines a locally owned boutique restaurant... it's great!The space is small, but adorable!  Very hip and modern yet has a laid back and fun energy going on.  There were a mix of people (young and old, business and casual) enjoying their lunches while we were there.  Although we didn't indulge, the wine list looked extensive for such a small place, so I'll have to return for that!  I ordered the Krazy Kobb salad - it was a really big portion.  I will admit, I didn't love the oriental salad dressing, but Sarah brought out the sherry vinaigrette as an alternative that I liked better.  I think I will try something different next time though; it still didn't blow me away.  I am sure it won't be a problem finding something since their menu is pretty diverse.  Maybe I should've taken advantage of the fact that I was there on a Tuesday - they have a 'Taco Tuesdays' special where you can order $2.50 tacos that are served with rice & beans, $2.50 Dos XX and Corona, and $3.50 margaritas!So, Maizie's had great energy and plenty of food/drink to choose from.  I don't think i ordered right this first visit, but you live and learn.  I look forward to returning to try some of the other menu items; maybe even Sunday Brunch!Quite the menu for such a tiny venue. OMG. I love a good rhyme! Maizie's made me a bit, um, crazy. Oh. Again. With the rhyming. I'm channeling Nipsy Russell. Impressive, cozy, urban space. And when I left. A smile on my face. Sadly my lunch choice, much like Elaine Joyce (this pop culture reference will really separate the young from the old), I say with a sigh, was dry, dry dry. I ordered a Milano sandwich with Italian meats and cheeses. Seriously. No. Really. Seriously. Quizno's or Subway would have been better. The fries were great, served with a "southwest" dipping sauce, i.e., mayo with chipotle sauce. The creamy artichoke dip with assorted, hot and fresh chips was yummy in my tummy. God. That was lame. Overall, my co-diners were "satisfied" with their lunches, not, however, going crazy for Maizie's. That said. I have high hopes, even when not high, for this Central Phoenix newbie! And the service was spot on I might add. Great vibe. Don't hide. Don't be lazies. Find Maizie's. Ok. I'm going to go back to playing with dolls and blocks now.I like Maizie's...I like it a lot. I think that for what it is its a good addition to the area. I met Melissa H., Christine O. and Melissa H. for happy hour today and I was quite pleased. Their specials, which run from 4-6, feature a good selection of $5 apps, $3 beers and well drinks, and $2 off glasses of wine. There were two wines on the wine list that I am a fan of so that made for a very happy hour. (Or two) The space is small. Intimate. Cozy. But not New York cozy where they have to pull out the table so you can slide into the booth. Its definitely more restaurant than bar. I like it because it fills a nice niche, its cute, its neighborhood-y, and its inexpensive. The menu is pretty large. Although I just sampled a few apps and soup (gauc- ok, could have used more cilantro, salsa- pretty decent, spinach artichoke dip- good, and french onion soup- very good, wished it was a larger crock) I would be willing to try their sandwiches (perhaps not the entrees) and I definitely want to try their brunch. Once the light rail is up and running I think I'll be here for brunch quite often! You have to understand what Maizie's is....its a neighborhood restaurant. Not in the Applebee's kind of sense but in the sense its one of those places you can count on when you don't want to cook and just want to eat out. Its not a special occasion type of place. Meet friends there for happy hour or grab a bite to eat before heading out..There's something about the vibe at Maizie's that feels so comfortable. It feels retro to me... a flashback to Indiana in the late '70s - early '80s. Maybe it's the giant bowls they serve the salads in. They make me think of Pizza Hut after a softball game circa 1980. Here are some things I like best about Maizie's:The wingless buffalo dip is deadly -- I mean that in a good way (and it should be on the late night menu). It's gotta be mostly cream cheese... how can you go wrong?!The fries are good, but the potato cakes are frickin' awesome! Thick mounds of really yummy mashed potatoes with a hint of horseradish, barely browned on either side.The inside out burgers are literally filled with the items described (my fave is the Feta burger - stuffed with feta cheese and sun-dried tomatoes and served with a thimble full of chipotle humus that packs a slight punch and is great on top of the burger as bizarre as that sounds)Only been here one time, but so far so good.  Had one of the inside out burgers (very tasty) and some cheesy buffalo chicken appetizer that was pretty good so I can't complain.  I need to go back and try many more items because everything looked so good.Kind of a small place so it was loud and crowded, which I guess could be a good thing for a restaurant these days.One word can sum up my experience at Maizie's- Unremarkable. The restaurant is a cute place, and I really wanted to like it. The service was slow. Our server would disappear for long periods of time, leaving us with empty glasses, and we watched as other tables got their food, even though we had ordered before them. I am not sure what is so difficult about making a sandwich, but clearly there was some rocket science type stuff going on back there that caused a 25 minute wait for the food.I had the veggie burger with fries, and my sister had a salad with ancho orange dressing and a cup of potato soup. I didn't try the salad, but the dressing was described to me as "tinted mayonnaise with no flavor". The thick and chunky potato soup got a better response- it was actually really good. About the veggie burger...kudos to Maizie's for making them in-house, but for crying out loud- could you give them some flavor, please? I now understand why the burger is served with apricot tzatziki and red onion marmalade- without them, the burger is tasteless. Ah well, the fries were good. One more nit picky thing that drives me crazy about this place- spelling errors on the menu. Seriously, there isn't a computer today that doesn't come with some form of spell check. Use it. I doubt I will be back to Maizie's. Nothing about the visit thrilled me.I like Maizie's.  Well, I've been 3 times in the last week so I guess I should say I like Maizie's a lot.I went for this first time a week ago with the fabulous Dottsy Z for a little much needed Happy Hour after work, and it was pretty packed.  Dottsy was kind enough to secure seats for us at the bar while I fought the wonderful PHX rush hour traffic.  They had $3 off all wines by the glass which I must admit was a pretty impressive selection, and they had a decent list of appetizers that all cost $5.We each ordered some wine and decided on the buffalo chicken dip.  HO-LY-CRAP this dip was good!!  I love the taste of buffalo wings but I hardly ever eat them because they're really messy and I invariably cover myself and whatever I'm wearing in them.  And as attractive as looking like a 5 year old is...Anyways, this dip is like the answer to my buffalo chicken prayers.  Came with a huge helping of pita slices and chips and it was delicious!!  Definitely going back for the dip alone!Luckily I don't have to.  Next time I went was Monday evening, and wouldn't you know it?  $3 burger and fries specials EVERY Monday night!  And they were gooood.  That pretty much ensured that I will be there every Monday from here on out until my arteries are so clogged that I have a heart attack and need to have a bypass.If that means I get to keep imbibing at Maizie's, I will take my chancesI still stand by the potato cakes (although they are flat and not thick any more) and the feta burger - whole heartedly! And, it is true the chicken on the southwestern chicken salad is well seasoned and has a good kick (appropriately soothed/complimented by the corn, jicama, peppers and mixed greens)... but, my most recent trip was on a Sunday and we sat at the bar to avoid the wait.Our service was excellent, even though they were really busy. Tina, the bartender, was engaging and offered up some great suggestions. That's how I found out about: the Drifter pale ale - a very refreshing beer with hints of grapefruit and apricot and LOTS of fizz! the $3 mimosas during brunch and, while I don't do bloody marys because of the tomato juice (yuck!) I had a taste of Tina's secret recipe spicy mixer and it's pretty dang good!! I could imagine drinking one of those bloody marys... Plus, I noticed they have a Sunnyslope high school football helmet (along with one from Brophy) displayed above the bar! We all know I'm a fan of Sunnyslope... so, for all of these reasons, I'm adding a star!i was really impressed with this impossible-to-park-at cafe. i think i committed three moving violations in two minutes trying to find a place to park and being trapped on the southbound side of central (stupid awesome light rail!). on an aside, anyone else not able to say or think "moving violations" without thinking of that 80s movie with bill murray's much less talented brother? and that song!anyway, i kind of expected my florist buzz surrounding my florist quality service and options. not at all! all servers were incredibly friendly and helpful - a feat given my dad's refusal to read a menu. it must be told to him, by a beaming, pretty waitress, please.patio is quite noisy and cramped - btw can't they do something about people locking their bikes to the fence since their handlebars stick into your sitting space and take up even more precious space?? they're prob the servers' bikes ... so work it out!we happened to go today, on St. Patrick's Day, and they had a special menu of Irish-inspired entrees. dad picked corned beef, mashed potatoes and gravy. i have never, ever tasted corned beef that was good. ever - it's typically stringy and tough. this was delicious, and they won my hard to please dad like whoa.i chose the cali spinach and added chicken; and that cheese, dressing and almond combo is divine.and yes, bonnie, not only did my dad enjoy this hipster joint, but that garlic bread is pretty good, too.I have forever banned Wendy's because of the square burger.  I think it's weird.  Maizie's changed that for me tonight.Went with Julia, Ayesha, Georgie and some guy Julia works with.  See, it's $3 burger night!  I'll put aside my disdain for the square burger.I got the house burger, which came with a side of fries.  Burger was H U G E huge!  That's OK.  I was H U N G R Y hungry!  It had lettuce and a slice of tomato on it, along with some slices of purple onion.  Served on Thick bread, like a ciabatta.  The fries still had the skin on them - my fave!  Lights dusted with some salt that had a bit of kick to it.I love that they also have Pellegrino.  I love sparkling water.  It makes me burp, which is what I *really* needed after that big, square burger!I've been here before on a Monday, and that was tight. The boneless buffalo wing dip deserves sonnets to be written about it. It's nearly orgasmic. No, really , I think I did leak a little eating this dip. It's just that good.Today, I experienced brunch at Maizie's and it was pretty solid. The four of us all ordered the Classic brunch--two eggs, breakfast potatoes, bacon, toast. Props to the potatoes, as they were delicious and garlicy and crispy and perhaps the most lovely potatoes I've had in such a long time. The mimosas were great! Get the bottle of champagne with a carrafe of orange juice. Have fun; don't drink until you're drunk and drive recklessly.There are two things that keep Maizie's from being five star in my book:1 - It is so warm that I felt like I was having early onset menopause2 - They are in an unfortunate location if you are going northbound on Central, because you have to flip a biatchHere are the things that make Maizie's pretty awesome:1 - $3 Burger Night Monday2 - $3 Beers during HH3 - $5 Bruschetta (that is freaking amazing)4 - Awesome bathroom with tasty smelling orange lotion5 - Cool looking bar6 - Big, open windows7 - Cool Aesthetics8 - Kung Fu Girl Riesling9 - Friendly, accommodating staff (especially for our large party)10- Lot's of options for everything: Food, Wine, BeerI really liked Maizie's a lot and I cannot wait to be back :)I met Roxy for wine and pizza Tuesday evening.  I showed up at about 6:20pm and the place was packed!  The place is little, but adds to the charm.  They don't win any interior decorating awards, but it is cute enough.  We sat at a two-top right in between two other two-tops.  We even chatted with our neighbors a bit.  It seemed the others were regulars.  Server Ed was super friendly too.When I arrived, Roxy had already ordered me a glass of wine and a pizza.  So I did not look at their menu.  Doesn't matter though- the pinot grigio was very tasty and on happy hour I believe.  The pizza was very, very delicious.  Great crust and sauce and their version of the Margarita pizza was spot on.  Traditional tomato, basil, and mozzarella, with added pancetta.  it was fabulous. It was a perfect summer dinner for 2 ladies.I'm sure we will be back soon, it's nice to break up the Postino's trips now and then.I have been on a quest to find the best fish n chips in CenPho.  I had heard they had a Tuesday fish fry at Maizie's and really love the place, so I had to give it a try.Four smallish pieces of fish, a stack of chips (with malt vinegar!!!), homemade tartar sauce and a couple of hush puppies.  Oh, and a side of slaw.I think the batter was a little bit much.  Hush puppies were dry.For $13, I had expected more.  It's only $8.25 at Turf and way more fish.I've been to Maizie's several times and the food is consistently good. Monday's are pretty bustling for the $3 burger plate and wine specials. It's chaotic but well worth the madness considering the deal. The wingless buffalo dip is one of my favorite plates and we've even been able to duplicate the recipe for a few of our own house parties. Another highlight is Maizie's Sunday Brunch. The red chili is awesome and so are $3 Mimosas & Bloody Mary's. We recently tried the Tuesday Fish Fry which was also great. Plenty of fried fish, a hefty serving of fries, two hush puppies and a creamy corn tartar sauce. The Half Baked dessert (warm cookie with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream) is the perfect ending to any meal and enough to share with at least two others. Additional high marks go for location (walking distance from the Central & Camelback light rail stop), patio seating (especially this time of year), wine punch card club (buy 5 glasses and your 6th is free. SCORE!) and the beer and wine selection. Service on a normal night is always great. Not so easy breezy on Monday nights or during the mad rush for Sunday Brunch. Certainly not a deal breaker for me, I've got a wine punch card and two more glasses gets me a freebie.Damn you, Maizie's... Why are you so damn delicious?!Maizie's has become my temptress as of late, luring me out of the confines of my apartment to dine on oh-so-delicious food, and drink great local beers all while not breaking the bank. I'm honestly more than a fan of this conveniently located restaurant. Maizie's is a well-decorated and well-staffed eatery with a menu that has the ability to please almost any craving a diner could have. I've yet to have a bad experience here whether it be with the food or with the staff. Also, they have some fantastic daily specials and a happy hour (M-F / 3-6) that rivals most in the valley. Some of the dishes I've tried include their Wingless Buffalo Dip, Bistro Tender Steak, Pizza Burger and the Matt's Pesto Manifesto Pizza. The dip was a bit much for me due to sheer guilt, but it was exactly what you would expect it to be, and the steak sandwich was above average, but just a steak sandwich. The other items though are fan-FLIPPIN-tastic! That pesto they use hits some high marks for me, and I find myself craving it much like crack-rock when I don't have it after a while.Every experience at Maizie's so far has been a great one for me, and I waited until many visits went by before writing this review. It's probably not for everyone, but it's one of my favorite spots for sure.I have now been here 3 times and my first time was great, as I stated in my first review.  But my last 2 visits have not been a pleasant experience.  I went for brunch a few months ago with a group of ladies, 25 of us, and our service was pretty terrible.  First we had confirmed the number of people in our party the day before but they still seemed unprepared for such a large party.  Our server was pretty rude as well, I swear she never cracked a smile.  Our party arrived within 30 minutes of or reservation time, some right on time others a little late and we had the large center table and 2 booths.  Our server stated after only 15 minutes and 12 of us being there that she couldn't hold the tables if we all weren't coming.  We assured her we were and everyone did show up.  It was the continual little things, not refilling water, not bringing fresh, chilled orange juice when we ordered another bottle of champagne for mimosas.  Rolling her eyes and sighing when we asked for the check to be split and never saying thank you before we left.Last night was so bad I won't be back.  I met with a friend for their pizza and wine special which I was super excited for.  The biggest problem was the bartender, she was rude, inattentive and totally cut corners when it came to making us happy.  We ordered a pizza and one of our toppings was goat cheese but only on one half.  When our pizza arrived it had mozzarella on one half and goat cheese on the other when the mozzarella should have been on the whole pizza.  This is a totally honest mistake and I can see where the confusion could have been in what we said and what she translated it to mean. But instead of apologizing she was a bit argumentative over what she thought we said when we ordered.  To make matters worse instead of having a new pizza made she asked the kitchen to just add the mozzarella on the side that was missing it and re-fire it.  What?!  It was charred in some places, dried out and all together simply not very good.  We were starving and contemplated sending it back, but twice in one night just seemed too much.  There was a nice gentleman that worked there who asked how are pizza was, bartender chick never did, we actually had to get her attention the first time to send it back.  We were in the middle of explaining why we didn't really like it when Ms. Snarky says "if you wanted me to have a new one made for you, you should have just asked."  WTF?!  I have worked in restaurants and usually when someone sends something back you remake it!  You should have done that in the first place!  She was so rude and it was really hard to even be polite to her at this point but I remained in the acting like a lady zone.  The did take it off our bill and gave us a free dessert.  Let me be clear, it was the gentleman who gave us the free dessert, he was very charming and apologetic.  If Ms. Snarky was nice about everything I wouldn't be writing off Maizies forever, but the icing on the cake was when she sat at the bar one seat down from us to eat her dinner.  I think that is very unprofessional but that wasn't what bothered me most.  The lady that took her place behind the bar and Ms. Snarky had a 10 minute bitch fest complaining about customers and how they can be such a pain in the ass.  The proceeded to regale each other with stories of how customers have annoyed them.  We paid our bill and left.  Ms. Snarky didn't say one word to us on our departure.  There are so many great places in the same area with a much nicer staff.  Those are the places I will be spending my money at.There are things about Mazie's that I just love. Like the sandwiches, expecially the turkado... It is exactly what it sounds like and delish. The breakfast burrito is amazing and covered in gravy. The benedict plates are okay. The hollandaise isn't my favourite and the eggs aren't poached... sad face. But so far... Everything else I have had there has been pretty amazing. Breakfast pizza has an egg on it... EGG! (If you like your eggs runny, order them sunny side up. The over easy eggs were overcooked) Also I love the sweet potato fries here. My favourite! The wait staff is always super friendly. Always quick to pick up plates and refill glasses. I love the ambiance. Lovely little signage hanging on the wine rack: Wine a little, you'll feel better. Thought that was really rad. There's not much else I can say about Mazie's that hasn't been said. Cool place to grab brunch or watch some football at the bar.I want so desperately to like Maizie's. The food is good, the atmosphere is decent, and it's on my street, just a 5 minute walk from my front door. Unfortunately after two terrible and embarrassing experiences I have decided to boycott them for life.On Sunday I was meeting someone for a business lunch. He suggested Carly's, I suggested Maizie's. He called Maizie's to see if they had any specials. The woman on the phone said that they have happy hour from 2-4pm on Sundays. When we got there we ordered some drinks from the young man and I asked "what's on special?" He laughed and said "we don't have specials on Sunday." I told him about how we called 20 minutes earlier and were told about happy hour. Again he laughed and said that they have never has specials and looked at me like I was lying. I asked to speak with the manager. He would not get the manager to come over. I said "do I have to get up and find the manager myself?" He said "do whatever you want."I spoke with the manager (blonde woman) and explained the backstory. She repeated the same statement "we've never had happy hour on Sunday." I told her I didn't care about that, I just want to know why I was told this on the phone. At this point most people in the packed restaurant were staring at us. We decided to leave since she was clearly uninterested in fixing this problem. After we went to Carly's (for a great dining and drinking experience) we got a call from the manager at Maizie's. She found out what employee gave us the incorrect info and offered us a couple free drinks. Nice try but I can't be bought off that easily. Free drinks doesn't make up for the bad attitude, terrible customer service, and embarrassing situation in front of a lot of people.Usually one bad experience isn't enough for me to give up on a place I love, but this wasn't the first time. The last time I came to Maizie's was 6 months ago, and there is a reason I haven't been back in 6 months. My girlfriend and I just finished our $100.00+ dinner and drinks and had paid our bill. Ten minutes after we paid, as we finished our drinks, a waitress came over to us and asked us if we would leave so that they could seat a large group that just walked in. No other tables were open, she didn't offer to move us, she asked us to leave. Seriously messed up and also embarrassing. So we left. I'm done leaving this place angry. Maizie's is done.Afternoon happy hour from 2 until 6 is very generous. This laid-back establishment is a perfect place to while away the afternoon blues on a hot, hot day in July.The appetizers for $5 and the sangria for $3 make this a feel good sort of place. You don't save much on the wings but the rest of the appetizers are a good deal. The hummus is very tasty and the doughnut wholes are a great snack or even a light dinner.The wait staff is efficient and our food and drinks were all correct when delivered to us. When we were there everyone sitting at the bar was wearing black. Possibly this is the required garb for acceptance into Maizie's cool club. If you just want a place to hang out, this is a viable spot and it won't cost you an arm and a leg. They have a few parking spaces out front but there is additional parking out back. This place is easy to find as it is on Central, just south of Camelback.
Ruth's Chris Steak House=My score is solely a reflection of the level of service we have received on several visits to Ruth's Chris - Madison.  I find their steaks to be excellent.  Mine have always been cooked perfectly to the requested temperature and well seasoned.  The sides and salads are great too.I decided to finally write a review after having dinner there last night.  First off, it is restaurant week and they are particpating in it.  However, they place the menu for restaurant week at the very back of the menu where it would be easy to overlook it.  I find that to be borderline shady.  Next, when we told our server, Honey, that we would be dining off of the Restaurant Week menu she turned ice-cold.  It was obvious she was not happy - eye rolls, quick short sentences, and her ability to ignore us as she walked by.  Her attitude throughout the entire meal was poor.  Frankly, she had the personality of a small soap dish.  Finally, the pace of the meal was really rushed.  Appetizer, Steak with side dish, one drink/beer each plus a bottle of wine, and dessert - total time at the table?!?  ONE HOUR.  Our impression of the evening was that Ruth's Chris was trying to churn-and-burn all the Restaurnat week dinners.The food last night was of the same high caliber we have had in the past.  We enjoyed it very much.If a restaurant is going to participate in Restaurant Week they should, in my humble opinion, embrace it rather than discourage it.  If they really don't want the Restaurant Week dinners because meals are discounted, no problem, just don't participate.  Not a big deal.  Several of Madison's finest restaurants do not participate and I don't hold it against them.  The lasting impression from Ruth's Chris - Madison is that they really didn't want us there last night.  OK - we will dine elsewhere from now on.
Amante Pizza and Pasta=Amante has some delicious salads, pastas and good pizza. The best part for me? It's right down the street from my house. The decor is freakin awesome. Lots of columns & neat decorations, you'll feel like you're dining in an upscale restaurant, but the prices aren't that bad ($9 - $15 for most pasta dishes). We really enjoyed the food, but they no longer have a liquor license. According to our server, they no longer serve alcoholic drinks since approximately 1 month ago. Again, I like the food, but I want some freakin wine with my Italian dinner. This short-coming will keep us from becoming repeat visitors.
McDonald's=Had to stay standing for almost 10 minutes when all I wanted was a drink. There was no line, only a bunch of lazy employees chatting it up on the side while only one of their crew members was left calculating prices and working out the transactions by hand since none of their registers were working. +2 stars for the lady busting her ass and delivering great service at 1am. Should've caught her name.
Blue Adobe Grille=I wish I was rating this place higher. However, lack of follow through from management leaves me no choice.Quick review: Got a big group? Don't bother calling and setting things up with Dianna. You'll feel like second-class citizens. It's sad, really.I knew something was wrong when I called on Wednesday to try and see if this place could accommodate our #evfn (East Valley Friday Nights) group. When I asked the person if they could accommodate 30 people, he suggested I call back and speak with Dianna the next day. Odd, but OK.When I spoke with Dianna on Thursday, I explained that we'd be bringing 30 people for a combination of dinner and drinks. She readily agreed that they could handle such a crowd, and said she would be happy to reserve A) a section of the bar and B) a group of tables contiguous to the bar, as not everyone would be eating dinner. Great. Sounds perfect, as some of us like to mingle, and setting us in one long table doesn't help with that.When we arrived at the schedule time, we found four small round tables pressed together near the bar, where a grand total of three chairs were unoccupied. You do the math. 30 people it was NOT going to accommodate.As the attendees began filing in -- and the space quickly filled -- we spoke to the management (possibly Dianna, though she never identified herself) and secured another table near us that was soon to vacate. Another four-top.As our numbers quickly swelled to the promised 30, there simply wasn't room. And this was around 6:30, so it's not as if we were early. Some of our late arrivals grabbed an available table -- only to be rather rudely told by management that the table had been reserved and that she had "already informed them that there were no seats available.". Great. So much for making room for the 30 we had spoken about.In the end, we called it short an hour into the evening. Having the bartender also act as our server was a huge mistake. The boy did what he could, but there was no way he could keep up with the growing bar patrons -- not our people -- and our swelling numbers. So everything was delayed -- including out trying to get the hell out of there so the place could return to normalcy. I'd not be surprised if some tabs went unpaid. Unfortunate if it happened, but patience only lasts for so long. And remember that they AGREED to allow us to bring the event to their establishment.The kicker? When one of our attendees mentioned that things weren't  going so well. Dianne's answer? "I told the man who called that we couldn't handle this size of a group, but you all decided to come anyhow!" So in the end, the shitty review. You'll probably see more. Up front I said this was unfortunate. And it's true, for the food was excellent. I had chili rellenos and was quite impressed. However, I'll never go back to this place because of bad service. And mind you, all of this was pre-arranged. We never went over our promised 30 people. Hell, they couldn't handle us when we were less than 20. It's not even communication failure. It's follow through failure.So feel free to try this group when it's a party of 2. Anything larger... you're on your own. And forget reservations. And abandon the idea of talking to Dianna. She obviously isn't anyone who can follow through.Having arranged our large group in advance, we were given 1/2 the space we needed, the restaurant itself was uncomfortably warm, and the service was awful - to put it nicely.After not being allowed to sit at one of the four open tables, several of us sat at the bar next to other patrons (not with our group) who were drinking and eating. When we mentioned to the bartender, whose attention it took almost 15 minutes to get, that we would like to order, he was clearly put out at the prospect of having to deal with it.A few minutes later when I asked for a glass of ice water, the bartender said "NO. Not at the BAR". When our food came, it was delicious (although one of the orders was wrong).In general the entire staff at the restaurant seemed put upon by our group.It's a shame, really, because the food was delicious. Pretty sure I won't be returning to Blue Adobe Grill.But the food was excellent!Too bad the service was so poor.  I'd called earlier in the week (Sunday) and asked if the restaurant could handle a group of approximately 30 people from 6-8 on the following Friday.  I was assured they could and that I should verify the reservation by Wednesday.  They also suggested we choose from a shorter menu to expedite everything.  Fine.  The other organizer called to verify and was assured we were welcome.  I arrived early and found four round tops set aside for us, plus one end of  the bar.  We shoved the tables closer together hoping to get another one into that corner, but no such luck.  The single waiter struggled to take drink orders and then food orders as half our group ended up standing and shuffling around other patrons attempting to get to the restroom.  We did snag one more table but when we tried to get another one, a woman who I assumed was the manager asked those people to move - that table was reserved.  (Though is was not used until much later as we tried to check out)  A few of our group at the bar were at first told they couldn't order food, and another couldn't get water.  We realized they just couldn't hand us and tried to get our checks.  I had to pay my drink order and my food order separately.  Two people got their checks and the rest of us ended up standing in a line to pay our bills.  Nobody helped this one poor waiter at all.I realize we have a large group but we did call more than once in advance and were assured there wouldn't be a problem.  When I mentioned to the manager that we were not please with the service she informed me that it was our fault, and that she'd warned us they were overbooked.  Gee, I don't remember any conversation that went that way.As far as I know, none of us had any complaints about the actual food though.  I heard many compliments and my meal was very good.  Its just that we were made to feel unwelcome, the service was very slow and the people at the bar seemed to have quite an attitude when our people tried to order anything but alcohol.Don't say you can handle a large group and then drop the ball before we even get started.This was my second visit to Blue Adobe, and I won't be back. The first visit was for a family birthday dinner, about 10 people, and they had trouble coordinating our tables, goofed up our orders, and generally didn't seem to care about us much at all. But the food was tasty (once they got it right) so I thought I'd try again with the EVFN group.Two of the staff seemed trying to help, but everyone else either ignored us or seemed inconvenienced by all of us ordering dinner and drinks. What a mess.Now I know the service problem wasn't a fluke. It seems to be a restaurant living on a very good cook's skills in the kitchen, and those skills are the only reason it isn't getting a single star. For good New Mexican style food, I'd suggest Los Dos Molinos not too far away.I was among the large group several other reviewers mentioned that visited Blue Adobe Grille. The points they made in their reviews were right on the money. Because of that, I'll keep this short and add just a few more.The one server taking care of the group was hit and miss. He paid attention to some and seemed to ignore others. I was encouraging him to go around the table to take each order but instead would take one at a time back to the kitchen, and ignore others as he was walking away. Not very efficient. Still, he was trying, so I'll give him that. One of the two stars above goes to him.I shared a chicken quesadilla and bean queso dip appetizer. Nothing complicated, but it WAS good. The plates others had looked appetizing also - when and if they ever got them. That accounts for the second star.The manager, walked up to me at one point near the end of our visit. I was standing by our assigned 4 tables chatting with another person in our group. In an annoyed voice she said, "I'm going to have to ask you to not crowd the other tables."  I was 3 feet away from the next table - I counted the tiles on the floor just to make sure. Is 3 feet considered crowding?  Those three blank stars? Lack of follow-through, lack of service and lack of accountability by the manager.
Jerome Bettis' Grille 36=I'm a real sucker for a feel good story and Jerome "The Bus" Bettis is all of that and more.  So, what fan of the 5 time Super Bowl Champion Steeler's doesn't wanna eat at Jerome's restaurant?Located in the Del Monte building near Heinz Field, the outside patio has an awesome view of the Pittsburgh City skyline.  On a hot Saturday afternoon, we opted for inside.  We were here for a late lunch, so we didn't get really adventurous.  My friend had a highly recommended Fried Italian Hoagie.  It was stuffed with salami, pepperoni, cappacola, provolone and hot peppers, battered and then "yes" deep fried.  It was crazy good!  My simpler tastes went for the Apple and Blue Cheese Salad with sherry bacon vinaigrette and candied walnuts.  Needless to say, I helped my friend polish off his hoagie and we took most of my salad home!  They also have the very best raspberry iced tea ever!Service was great.  We had a team of servers attending to our needs, not just one.  They seemed to be working as a mob, even though the place was busy.My friend commented that the men's room had a two way mirror, I could live without knowing about that.  4 star restaurant, get's another star for being Jerome's.  I said I'm a sucker.  No, I'm a fan.  I love it!The only word to describe this situation is HORRIFYING. I'm going to start this with clarifying statements.1. I know how busy restaurants get on Saturdays. 2. I understand it was exactly the time for that late dinner/drinks crowd.3. The North Shore gets crazy when there is a Pitt game, even away games.4. I have worked in restaurants before. THE WAIT:That all being said, we expected a longer wait for a table. What we didn't expect though, was to be told that they "in no way could even give you an estimate on how long this will take."  We had a party of 5 people, not a large group at all. After standing outside in the beautiful weather drinking beers, we soon realized that we'd been waiting for nearly 2 hours.Eventually this lovely hostess, Christine, approached us (they call your cell phone when a table becomes available) and asked us how long we'd been there. We told her and she immediately got us a table. She was truly a great employee. THE FOOD:Finally seated, it was another 5-10 minutes before a waiter came over. His name was Bobby and he was clearly young and new to serving. He was running circles around the tables. He obviously had a full section. 2 in our party ordered wings as an appetizer and those actually came out really quickly. They smelled great and I don't think either of them had any qualms with the taste either. This is where took a quick and crazy downturn. We asked the waiter for napkins and refills on beers, we didn't see him again for 10-15min. I actually had to flag down a bus boy/food runner for napkins/silverware. The waiter stopped back and we reminded him about the drinks we needed, which by this point had gone from 2 to 4 beers. We placed our order and 1 in our party ordered the 36 steak. In case you're not familiar with this it's a 56$ 36oz steak. This is a serious piece of meat. He ordered it medium well, and the waiter did let us know that this may delay the food coming as this steak is thick. The rest of us ordered various burgers. By this point I'm starting to get hangry (an anger driven by extreme hunger). I made certain to stop and tell 2 manager/supervisory types how great Christine was doing and she had even stopped back to check on us just to make sure things were ok! THE HORROR:We have been at this place for 3 hours now. Waiting for food for a little over 1.5 hours. The general manager stops over to our table with some of the absolute WORST customer service skills I've ever encountered. He did apologize, but it went like this... "We really don't know when you food will be out. Our kitchen is sort of down right now. It's coming eventually, bro." The member of our party who ordered the 36 actually asked him to just forget the steak and get us 5 burgers to go so we could go back to our boat. He also mentioned that if the meal was free we would leave with our burgers to go, make sure to really take care of the server, and leave as happy as possible. The manager's exact words... "I don't care if the server gets taken care of, I just want the customers to be happy." I was so offended. As I mentioned, I've worked in the food industry as did someone else in our party. That's just too much. The food came out about 5 minutes after that, including the steak. The steak was so bad that my friend couldn't eat it. It was cold and dry it almost made me choke. This was Denny's/Eat N Park grade steak, not 56$ steak. My boyfriend and our friend had the deep fried burger, I tasted that and it was delicious too.  Here is where I snapped though... I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger with a side of sweet potato fries. I am shaky at this point as I've been on a boat in the sun and haven't eaten anything. I put the top of the bun on my burger and grab a steak knife as I almost always have to cut a burger in half. I saw the burger in half, drooling as meat juices (I also like it medium rare.) and bbq sauce is squishing out. I pick up half of the burger and notice in the very low lighting something far brighter pink than the meat right in the middle of my burger. A PIECE OF PINK PLASTIC IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BURGER. I knew immediately what it was, it was the medium rare indicator that they are supposed to stick in the top of the burger. It was laying flat IN THE MIDDLE OF MY MEAT. I shot up out of my seat and took it right back inside and forced the manager to take it from me. I reminded him that this food can't get any more free than it is right now, and I don't have another 3 and a half hours to wait for food. He tried to tell me that it couldn't have been inside it. To which I picked up the other half and pulled the cut in half indicator out of the center. I didn't even get to eat dinner after 4 hours of waiting.Never ever ever again. I left starving and angry.
Well Being In The Box=We come from a place where Asian cuisine is spectacular, where it's cooked by people who can't speak a word of English but make the most exquisite Asian cuisine.  When we moved to the states, we were expecting to find better food out here, since the states promises better and bigger things.We tried the great Asian restaurants in the Venetian, the Forums, and every other place you can think of.  Even the locals suggested a few asian buffets, but to our dismay the food was just "okay", and not the great flavors I sought.One day, out of sheer luck, we passed by this restaurant and finally decided to stop in.  Walking in felt like home; the counter in the front, the nice, homely tables around the sides, and the music just like the stuff played over the speakers at the Chinese and Japanese restaurants where we're from.The service, for a small restaurant, is impeccable.  Not only are they there to give you refills without asking, but the food comes out fast and extremely well plated.  Our first experience here happened to be what we've sought--great sushi.  We tried their tempura sushi and tuna, and to our amazement, we were finally home.Their culinary delights include their fabulous tempura that, in all honesty, beats the hotel restaurants and buffets on and off the strip.  Theirs is real tempura--light, crispy batter, perfectly brown and very well seasoned.  Their bulgogi, kalbi, and barbecue chicken is a delight.  If you order anything that comes with a special box, you must eat their macaroni and regular salad.  Even their miso soup is excellent.  Compared to a five star restaurant at home, this place is up there.I'm not exxagerating when I say that this is the best Japanese and Korean food in Vegas.  It honestly is, and if you want a taste of real Japanese and Korean food is, you MUST eat here.  Since my discovery of this place, we eat here every day for dinner, and we will continue to because their food is the best in Vegas.  Hands down.
Bloomfield Bridge Tavern=I love the BBT as a cheap dive bar and for the great polish food.  I almost always get some pirogies and some kielbasa.  Most times after I order I see an old polish woman come out from nowhere and start cooking up my food!  It is definitely not health food, the 'rogies come out dripping in butter with some onions (and some sour cream), and the keilbasa comes simply as a giant delicious mouth watering link on a plate.  Although if there is a group of people who order different types of  'rogies you are almost guaranteed not to receive the mixture you ordered.  The live local music is fun, the beer fridge has a decent variety and a $1 bottle night on Thursdays, and their fries are good for snacking too!I'd really like to give this higher ratings, due the the $1.10 beers, decent bar food and friendly owner, but my last experience left a sour taste in my mouth.A group of friends and I were there on a Thursday in March, having a few beers and eating some Polish food at the bar. Now, if you haven't been here before they have 2 TVs behind the bar, about 15 feet apart from each other.It was like any other Thursday in March - cold and rainy, half empty bar - except it was the beginning of the NCAA basketball tournament. My friends and I were hoping to catch some of the games and we knew BBT would be a little iffy because the Penguins were playing (normal, regular season game), but we figured we'd ask the bartender if we could get a basketball game on one of the TVs. It couldn't hurt to ask, right? Wrong.The conversation, with the female bartender, went a little like this:Friend: "Excuse me, would it be possible to put the tournament on?"Bartender: "Don't you know the Pens are playing? Aren't you a Pens fan?"Friend: *looking down at his Phillies shirt* "No, I'm not from Pittsburgh."Bartender: "We can't change the channel. We have paying customers who will leave if we change the channel."Fair enough, we knew it might not happen. We even excused the bartender's terrible logic (inferring that we weren't paying customers; we certainly paid for our drinks and meals). And that was fine with us. We were perfectly content to continue hanging out and have a few more drinks before moving on.However, that was not possible as the bartender refused to serve us for the rest of our time there. No, it wasn't an honest mistake; she knew we had empty beers and were trying to order more, but every time she came close to us she dipped her head or averted her eyes. It was quite obvious. Eventually she had to come in front of where I was seated to make a drink for another customer, and that was when I was finally able to make eye contact to ask for another drink. She said OK and walked away, never to return.And that's when I decided never to return.No Ms. Bartender, what makes paying customers leave, contrary to your popular belief, is not changing a channel or the lack-thereof.  It's disrespecting them.I visited Bloomfield Bridge Tavern on Fri. evening around 6:15 with a friend from out of town and her dad.  I had been wanting to visit BBT for a long time, and her visit provided the perfect opportunity for me to try it while exposing my visitors to a very Pittsburgh-esque environment.  After battling the crazy traffic on Liberty due to the bridge closure, missing the entrance, and battling it yet again, we parked and made our way inside.As others have mentioned, the interior is definitely divey, but not smoke-laden, unlike many other dive bars in PGH.  We were carded literally as soon as we walked in the door.  We originally thought we'd sit out on the porch, but decided against it, given that the porch is a smoking area.  At the time of our visit, it was pretty empty, with only a handful of locals seated at the bar, and a few people on the porch.  The environment was pretty quiet, given the sparse crowd and lack of music, allowing us to converse freely.After perusing the menu, my friend and her dad each ordered a big hop ($5 each), and I ordered the Arsenal Cider on tap (Fighting Elleck; $6.50).  For food, I ordered 6 pierogies (2 potato/cheddar, 2 farmer's cheese, and two sauerkraut), which were on special for half off at the time of our visit ($0.75 apiece) with sour cream ($0.75, as I found out later), as well as an order of potato pancakes and applesauce ($5.95). My friend and her dad each ordered the red polish platter, which comes with kielbasa, a potato and cheddar pierogie, golabki, haluski, and kluski ($10.95 per platter).  All of the food was delicious and extremely filling, and the drinks helped to wash it all down.Upon eating all of my pierogies, I noticed that, despite my request for 2 pierogies of each flavor, 3 sauerkraut and only 1 farmer's cheese had been included in my order.  I mentioned this to the woman who bussed our dishes (different from our waitress), and asked if I could have another farmer's cheese pierogie, since that was my favorite flavor.  She said she'd get one for me, and a farmer's cheese pierogie was brought out to correct the mistake at no charge.Overall, all of us greatly enjoyed our visit to BBT.  I'd highly recommend it if you're in the mood for good Polish food, or are just looking for a genuinely Pittsburgh-esque eating experience. If possible, try to come on Fri. or Sat. between 5-7pm to take advantage of the half off pierogie deal! 4.5 stars.
The Cafe=It's been at least 5 or 6 years since the last time I visited this joint.  I worked at the Eldorado Casino back in the mid 90's and this place use to have decent food......that was back when it was named "Cactus Joe's".  It's really gone downhill since those days.I happened to be in the area and stopped by for lunch with my Mom.  I ordered the Nachos w/o Meat and Mom ordered the Fish & Chips special.After a short wait we were served our food.  I was disappointed to see that the Nachos were Chips, Cheese Whiz, Tomatoes, Onions on a plate with a small bowl of Beans, cup of Guacamole, cup of Salsa, and two packages of Sour Cream on the side......what the ___?  Was I suppose to create this thing myself?  Where did it say that on the menu?  I know why they did it.....to save money.  There's less food waste when you do stuff like that, but seriously?As a fan of Nachos it was a huge letdown.....plus they didn't taste good at all.  The Chips weren't fresh and the flavors were just strange.....unappealing.Mom enjoyed her Fish & Chips, which were really Fish & Fries.  She liked her Fish and I tried a few Fries...they weren't bad.  Maybe I ordered the wrong item?Overall, the service was good and since Mom enjoyed her dish I'm giving this place 2 Stars instead of 1.Will I return?  Someday I probably will for the sake of nostalgia....but I predict it won't happen any time soon.
Mido Sushi=I've had a nasty bug and have been eating lots of soup.  I decided to check with Yelp and see if there are any Japanese places close to the office so that I could have some miso soup for lunch.  This idea led to the following:"Mido Sushi!""Yes, do you have Miso soup?""Hello?""Do you have miso soup?""Mido Sushi!""DO YOU HAVE MISO SOUP?""Soup?  Miso?""Yes.""Hello?""YES!""Mido Sushi!""MISO SOUP!""You come get!""Ok.  Hello?""Click."*from the next office*   "You're having miso soup for lunch?  Sounds good."So the miso soup was inexpensive. I got basically a quart for about $1.75. The broth itself was pretty good but it had minimal tofu and no scallions or other garnish.  Average miso at best but when you have the flu it works well.
North Italia="EXCUSE ME!"Such was the theme of the night.  Trying to get good service here is nearly impossible.  Servers would walk past our table without even a second glance causing us to have to scream and flag them down.  Ugh.We stopped in for some drinks and dessert, after an early dinner elsewhere in NoSco.  After our experience I'm not sure that I would return for lunch or dinner....and it makes me wary to try North.  The mini cannolis had a very overpowering lemon flavor.  Cannolis are my favorite dessert....in my life I have had about 50 billion of them.  My wedding cake had cannoli filling.  I have never had lemon flavored cannoli before. It was half gross and mostly disgusting.  The chocolate and hazelnut "cake" was really a brownie in the shape of pie with a lot of whipped cream and some hazelnuts on top.  Not quite what I was expecting.The drink selection is pedestrian as is the beer and wine selection.  Then there is the water.  Holy cow I felt like I was drinking a glass of the chemicals my parents put in their pool.  It smelled awful and tasted absolutely disgusting.  I forced it down but oh man, they need to adjust their water filter.Its all open seating according to the server we ran into on the way in.  Although when we made the move to a newly open table we were told it was reserved.  What is it? Open or reserved?  Once we got a spot on the patio we were treated to parents letting their children run through the fountain at Kierland at 10pm.  I don't know...when I was 7 years old I wasn't running around crazy at 10pm at night.  (And I was most certainly not in Bar North after that having dessert and whatever.  Who brings a kid into a bar at 10pm on a Saturday night?!) Then came time for the check.  We waited so long for our server to pick it up that I actually had to go to the bar and pay for it there. All in all I was completely unimpressed.  Given the bizarre cannoli and the mediocre "cake" combined with the terrible service I'm not sure I would go back.....the only reason its getting the third star is because the pickings in North Scottsdale are slim.NoRTH is a great place to go for lunch or happy hour if your near Kierland. This is one of the better Fox restaurants with great food, fantastic service with a somewhat trendy northern Italian decor.  We miss their location on the west side on 67th.They offer a lighter side of Italian cuisine with an emphasis on freshness. This is not the place to go if your looking for the heaver side of Italian with loaded meaty sauces and carb-o-roma items galore.  They offer some classic carb loaded dishes and pizzas. But for the most part they offer several wonderful dishes on the lighter side with loads of fresh grilled seafood, chicken and veggies.  Their zucca chips or bruschetta with prosciutto and crescenza cheese are great starters with a glass of wine. The baked ziti bolognese with spinach, ricotta & mozzarella cheese is delish,  The pasta with butternut squash is also very good.  I always order their grilled chicken sandwich with a side of seasonal grilled veggies or their ahi tuna salad which is devine.  Their happy hour is fantastic with bargains on drinks and several apps. They have great service and will accommodate most special request for those with special dietary needs.Had dinner here with a colleague recently.  After browsing the menu, decided to go for the Baked Ziti (Bolognese, Spinach, Ricotta, Mozzarella Cheese, $16) and a glass of 2007 Frog's Leap Zinfandel, $12.50.  The weather was awesome, so we dined outside on the patio.Our server was awesome and made sure our glasses of Wine were never empty.  The food came out pretty fast.  I took one bite of my Ziti and instantly became a fan!  The Bolognese Sauce had the right combination of Spinach & Ricotta to make a heavenly dish....the proportions of ingredients was just right so that any one flavor didn't overpower the meal.  It went great with the glass of Zin.....which had a nice Chocolate-Berry flavor with a slight Peppery bite to it....yum!Overall, it was really good dinner.  Can't wait to come back and take The Better Half.Return Factor - 95%No where near as good as the one on 40th and Camelback.  And the seating, it is so horrible, for gods sakes, get some more comfortable chairs.  I work my ass off to be in shape, so I don't have enough cushion for those hard chairs.  We had our moms night out there last Saturday and my hubby offered to drive me, so I told him to pick me up after two hours.  He told me I could stay longer,  I told him, no way, my butt couldn't take it any more, I went to the chiropractor on Monday, I still have such a back ache from those horrible, horrible chairs.  Stepping down from the soap box, the pizza piece I tasted from my friend was ok, and my other friend barely ate her muscles.  The Milano Mule was good, but didn't numb my back pain enough.Found this place on Yelp (of course) and my husband I came here for lunch.  We sat outside on a beautiful not so hot day.  We had great service and delicious food.  We ordered the following:Grilled Cauliflower ($10).  So good, I'm not a fan of cauliflower but I will make this dish an exception.  It also had grilled asparagus, toasted breadcrumbs (next time no breadcrumbs, it took away the flavor of the dish), pancetta cream, lemon and a fried egg.  This was a great dish!The Pig Pizza ($15) - With all the cured meats, it made the pizza very salty.  It was still really good but I will do without it next time. Heirloom Beet Salad ($11) -  I love beets and this is a delicious salad.  It also had apples, hazelnut, cheese and lemon crème fraiche.  Delicious!Bolognese ($16)- Excellent!!!  Full of flavor, I can eat this all day!I will definitely go back!A friend of mine recommended North, and it did not disappoint. Cool vibe & great ambiance. We started with their "signature" appetizer, the "Zuc chips" ( deep fried zucchini chips ). They were thin, delicate and delicious. I hade the Kale salad, which was packed with tasty and healthy ingredients. My wife had the "Simple salad", she said it was "simply" delicious. She particularly enjoyed the inclusion of toasted pine nuts. My main course was the Rosemary chicken. It was perfectly prepared, moist, tender and very tasty. My wife had pan seared scallops, which she thoroughly enjoyed.Service was great, our waiter was attentive without being obtrusive, he answered all our questions and helped with insightful suggestions to help us make our delicious decisions.We'll definitely make North a regular stop on any future trips to Scottsdale.North has a number of locations in Arizona and Texas.I just had dinner at the Kierland location in North Scottsdale.Kierland is a beautiful mall and North is very pretty. (see pics) There is an impressive bar, two dining rooms and a cozy patio that is heated for comfortable outside dining in the winter.The menu includes appetizers/small plates, salads, pastas & mains.

Although I made reservations and there were plenty of tables available, I had to ask several times to be seated. There were 3-4 different hosts and no one was able to figure it out. Unfortunately, all the effort to make a great environment and fantastic menu ALWAYS gets over shadowed by poor service and thus the 4 stars instead of 5.Parking is limited. Parking garage is near by. Hours:Lunch: 11am - 4pmDinner: 4pm - 9:30pm/10:30 Fri/SatHappy Hour: 3pm - 6pmFor more information:NorthItaliaRestaurant.comOverall, I 4/5 highly recommend North at Kierland.
Native Grill & Wings=Worst dining experience in 2009 for me.  Where do I start?1.  Sat at a table that had menus and silverware, but was obviously not wiped down.2.  They can't decide who our server is, 5 mins, 6 mins, 7 mins go by... and right at about 10 mins. someone is our server.3.  Menu says Sam Adams on draft.  Turns out, after a long wait, there is no Sam Adams on tap and we order again.4.  Potato chips were delayed because they did not have any pre-made chips.  They arrived with the main meal.5.  Kitchen staff was joking around, girls screaming, almost as if it was a little Spring Break party inside and everyone could hear them.6.  Calzone was ice cold in the middle.  Frozen ricotta cheese?7.  Pizza was burnt on the top.  No, you're not supposed to have those black circular splotches on the cheese.8.  Just a few casual apologies from the teenage waiter for the above.  No manager apology, no "comped" items, nothing.This place seems like it was transplanted from some dopey college campus where every customer is 21 or under and just comes here to get drunk, regardless of food quality, service, and the time it takes to get food.Native New Yorker is a failure.  I regret not taking the other Yelp reviews more seriously, since NNY has a clear trend towards the low end of things, at this location and on Bell.Came in here before and wasn't greeted by anyone. Felt like a morgue. I've been to the native in Tempe and enjoyed it, this one not so much. After no hostess or server came around for a few minutes we ended up walking out the door. Oh well guess I'll stick to the Tempe location.
Claim Jumper=I love to dine at Claim Jumpers; in other cities but the Bay Area. For some apparent reason- the foods and drinks taste a lot better, the service is more professionally efficient and the restaurants are a lot nicer from other CJ's locations than the Fremont and Concord, CA locations. Maybe it's me, I don't know!This Claim Jumper is located (dead-center) in the outdoor Town Square shopping complexAs a high-volume eater, I love the amount of food offers to us. I also love the lunch items at Claim Jumper including the appetizers and the French Onion Soup. That hearty soup is also a pretty good size too.For lunch, I had a pair of one of  my personal favorites; the Caesar Salad and Chicken Fingers. The $10.95 poultry dish has five boneless breast battered to a golden brown. I also get a choice of dipping sauce, in which I chose the Bleu Cheese.  And the $6.95 Caesar Salad was tasty with salad dressing and the colorful green color of the Romaine lettuce. My salad: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg?select=DB-rVyekCYtrN03DP04YOgMy chicken fingers: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg?select=J5I8LRVYbemBdph4mHJdNAI also had a glass of Arnold Palmer (1/2 Lemonade & 1/2 Iced Tea) with free refills too. What a refreshing way to beat the desert heat!My drink:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg?select=rdK6ulY-Eutca40HxQs8LQWhile my food were being prepared, complimentary dish of buttery popcorn were serve. I can smell even the popcorn popper all over the facility. The popcorn also tasted good in my salad too. You should try that/ Popcorn: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg?select=xBfvl0agZUXeadGhxsSmOwI had a great seat in a booth right across from the bar where I can watch ESPN and CNN on the TV at the bar. Also Ernesto, the hustling bartender/waiter, took my order and serving my needs. My seat: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg?select=-qApaquDlMupSBQltdpL2wThe restaurant were also playing musics from the 80's, including Duran Duran's "Hungry like the Wolf." Indeed, my appetite was like a wolf.  My experience from this location is a positive one.  The only downfall is that the dessert case is smaller than the other locations. Just the perfect size to display the monsterous "Motherlode Cake."I just had dinner with a group friends, and with all of us being as original as we are, we all decided to be cheap and get the 4.75 california quesadilla. Little did we know, we all asked for chicken, and when the bill came for the table, we were all charged 11.95 for the chicken quesadilla! How were we supposed to know?! Our waiter was the nicest guy in the world, but he gave us little tips on what foods to choose.Customer service wise, great people who love to help, but you would have to ask! Come to this restaurant with an extremely empty stomach because two people can share one plate it seems!
Shed Cafe=On the 3500 block of Saint Laurent there is a host of nice restaurants, almost all with white tablecloths and candle lights, surrounding the trendy Complex Ex Centris shopping and cinema mall. At first glance, the Shed Cafe fits the bill, with its red lighted sign. But then you realize that the tables have no cloths, and there are large plasma TVs on overhead, with mostly groups of casually dressed men inside. This is Montreal's version of a sports bar!In this wine and hockey crazed town, where else can you go and watch Monday Night American Football? You may have to settle for Molson, or maybe Stella beer, or god forbid, a glass of French wine, but you can get your football fix! And perhaps better food than Hooters!Mais, Il n'est pas du lipstick sur le cochon!(excuse my French! I can't remember what I learned in High School!)Rough translation: But, No pigs with lipstick on them!There may be male chauvinist pigs present watching the game, but no pigs wearing lipstick! (Even though there is MAC lipstick store 3 doors down!)Come here for some food and drinks, and sports. On nice days, sit out on the sidewalk cafe tables and Shed a few.
Red Thai=Red Thai is on the St. Laurent corridor, filled with little, nice restaurants. Red Thai has a cozy, romantic decor, with purple velvet drapes inside Thai Palace carved alcoves separated by wood carvings of kneeling Thai statues with prayer beads, appearing to hold up the columns. The theatre track lighting with orange gels creates a nice mood, and the opposite side has a full wall smoked mirror to give the illusion of space. Nice Bamboo, Hawaiian Ginger and Orchids adorn the entry. The tables are clothed and have little plastic, pink lotus flowers in a glass bowl, with mood candlelights on every table. Sultry Diana Krall sings alluring jazz numbers and fingers her keyboard over the stereo system. The service is timely, polite and on point. The dishes themselves are elegant, in blue and white decorated porcelain, and shaped like a duck, a leaf, etc. The food is great. Try the Plamur, which are two calamari body halves, grilled, and sprinkled with sesame seeds, and dipped in a Thai sweet/spicy sauce. Follow the Plamur with a Gai Kang Kiew, a green chili chicken curry, with spicey red pepper slices, but not overdone with coconut milk, well seasoned and cooked just right, over your white jasmine rice. They don't have Singha Thai beer, but they do have a good wine list and hard to find Hue Beer, from Central Vietnam, or Sapporo from Japan. Bring your date here and have a romantic evening, with good food, good service, beautiful surroundings, and Dianna Krall to get you in the mood.
Russell's Restaurant=This is College of Southern Nevada's Hospitality/Culinary Dept's restaurant.  The front of the house staff are students in the school's Restaurant Management class.  The food are prepared by Culinary Arts students in one of the Culinary Department's restaurant classes (e.g., Aromatics, French, International), with menu changing daily during the weeks that the instructional restaurant is open.This is a sample menu prepared by students in the Aromatics class from 10-14-2008:Choice of Soups or SaladsButternut Squash Soup with Garam Masala or Wild Rice Soup with Fresh Marjoram, Seasonal Mixed Greens with choice of Maytag Blue Cheese Dressing, Apple-Walnut Vinaigrette, or Asian-Orange Vinaigrette.Choice of Entrées:Grilled Marinated Ahi Tuna served with Fried Wasabi Potato Cakes and Hot and Spicy Eggplant with toasted Sesame Seeds.Linguine tossed in White Clam Sauce with Littleneck Clams and Fresh Oregano.Curried Lamb and Vegetable Stew served over Cous-Cous with Mint Chiffonade.One of 3 Dessert selections prepared by Pastry Students in the program.All meals include Homemade Bread or Rolls prepared by CSN Culinary Arts Students under the direction of Master Pastry Chef/Professor Rudi Eichler and Pastry Chef/Instructor Ms. Jody Lee.Price $7.95 (tax included, tips goes toward CSN Scholarship fund)North Las Vegas is far for most ppl, especially with the freeway and road constructions currently causing havoc on Las Vegas roads, but if you are in the area it is well worth the drive.  The dessert that is served alone can cost $7+ in a typical restaurant with its own Pastry Chef.  This is literally the best deal in town when the school is in session.
Brookwood Farms BBQ=I used to fly through CLT all the time and was pleasantly reminded why I didn't mind spending a couple hours here on my travel days. The reason is this BBQ spot. Its quick because its done fast food style in the food court but the food is delicious. Probably the only place in here with a line because people literally search it out.I get the same thing every time - pulled pork sandwich with mac n cheese and a fried pickle on the side (comes with it). The pork has tons of flavor before you even put sauce on it and their sauce adds that much more. It's not my favorite style of BBQ sauce but no complaints by any means.I think the fried pickle is my favorite part. Every time I get fried pickles they are done as chips but this place throws in a battered pickle spear with your meal. I need to look for more places that do them like this.If you're in an airport with terrible options this place is a savior.Memphis. St. Louis. Kansas City. Barbecue capitals of America. You should include Charlotte, as we know 'cue here in this town and don't y'all forget it. So when you're changing planes here our very fine Queen City airport, stop in the main atrium (between the B and C concourses) and get yourself a plate of barbecue.Yep, there's a line. Yep, it's totally worth it.I got the pulled pork sandwich, which comes with one side. Mac & cheese is it. And of course, a fried pickle spear. You Yankees who ain't never had a fried pickle? Try it, you might like it.They'll offer to put barbecue sauce on the meat. Your answer here is "Yes, please."At the register, grab one of those locally brewed beers that you probably won't find elsewhere. OMB ("Olde Mecklenburg Brewery") or NoDa or a Carolina Blonde from Carolina Brewery up in Mooresville. Maybe a little cup of banana pudding too.And find a place to sit. In this instance, I don't recommend the rocking chairs as it's potentially messy food and you don't want to wear it.Pick up your sandwich and dig in. If it's like mine, it's tender and juicy and tangy and delicious. Mmmmm... that's barbecue. Welcome to Charlotte. Enjoy your stay!
San Felipe's Cantina=Me and my wife went to san felipes cantina in Tempe AZ Saturday 6/28/08 they wouldnt let me in becouse I have my daughters name tattoo on my neck, they said just that day management told the workers not to let people in with tattoos above there shoulders. So becouse if this kind of stereotype or racism I rate san felipes cantina in Tempe AZ zero stars. And the worst bar in AZThe food is pretty much inedible. After dark it turns into a hot, sweaty, ugly, trashy dance fest of scary people...who want to fight...or worse yet...fuck.Two stars because it is possible to day drink here and survive. But for the love of god as soon as the sun goes down run. RUN!Worst experience ever at a bar... My friend and I stopped by after grabbing lunch elsewhere in the marketplace. We had just order our first beer and started talking to a couple at the bar next to us. The guy jokingly attached 4 straws together and was trying to drink out of his dates cup. The bartender grabbed the straws, pulled them apart and threw them away without making any eye contact with any of us. Shocked, we told her she was very rude, and that it was completely uncalled for. She immediately cut all four of us off and told us to leave. We asked for the manager, who was in his early thirties, overweight and a complete underachieving nerd named Ryan. He said he stands behind his waitresses regardless of what happened. I told him I would ruin him on yelp and he replied, "yelp is worthless, nobody reads it anyway." Other than that, the bottled beer tasted fresh.We decides to check out San Felipe's to satisfy a fish taco craving. It always looked pretty busy having walked by on other occasions.  Since we were planning on seeing a movie, it seemed convenient.We should've followed our instincts and turned around when we saw the skankily dressed and over made up waitresses smoking outside the back door.We were given the option of inside, bar, or outside. We opted for outside, and loved the cell call service for when the table was ready. There was no mention or indication of there being a band on the patio.   The hostess put us on the same side of a sticky picnic table. We had to move a couple of smokers who were sitting on top of the table before we could sit down. Note, WE had to,the hostess did not. At that point we realized a band was about to start playing.  Luckily we were able to get prices and place a drink order before the screeching started.The drinks and our appetizer of chips and salsa came quickly, but our waters did not.  The music was so loud we couldn't even focus on reading the menu.  We asked to be moved inside, and the waitress obliged. The hostess (also the manager?) came out to move us, and made it clear in her facial expressions that we were severely inconveniencing her. She took us inside, and I caught her rolling her eyes at a waitress as she re-seated us. About 15 minutes later, we finally had a waitress approach us. During this time we had discussed dropping some money on the table and leaving, but we were too hungry and figured the experience could only get better from here.  We couldn't have been more wrong.First request, the water we hadn't gotten yet.  We immediately placed our order, and it came out about 10 minutes later.  It was dropped by a surly food runner with zero personality. Water?  Still missing.  I was stuck sipping my weak margarita and by boyfriend had nearly finished his beer.When we were halfway done with our lukewarm meals, the waitress came to check on us.  Was she carrying water?  Nope.  Finally she followed through on something and brought them.During this time we were subjected to the horrible music coming in from outside.  I'm fairly certain the band's singer was both tone deaf and unable to keep a beat.  I have heard better music at last call in a backwoods karaoke bar.The baja sauce was disgusting. It's basically watered down mayo with a little hot sauce mixed in.  I should've taken to heart their sign that said "if  the food doesn't meet your standards, lower your standards."Well, we finished our meal and waited for our check....for nearly 25 minutes. Between the bad music, bad food, and bad service, we nearly left without paying. Its clear nobody would've noticed.  Since we have manners, I got up and asked the 4 waitresses standing around at the entry for our check, since our's was MIA. They scurried off, and I assumed they were finding her.  After ANOTHER 10 minutes, she finally showed up with the check. AND she had the nerve to say "see you guys next time!" Never again.  Save your time, save your money, save your ear drums. Avoid San Felipe's Cantina.
Fatburger=For some reason I'm on a Fatburger kick lately.  I was in the area, so I stopped by and ordered a Large Fatburger with Cheese and Skinny Fries. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5jTmjxb1X34EfcY1gos4tw?select=GHXXu6KUhAB1WgvXVovFBghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5jTmjxb1X34EfcY1gos4tw?select=nuXk9K_k26TXuwTqscisEAI like this location because the restaurant is always clean and there are plenty of seats and tables.The food took a while to come out.....it's Fatburger after all.  The Fatburger was very good, as usual, and the Fries were cooked just right.  I couldn't finish the order of Fries, next time I'll pass.  Solid 4 Stars ()Return Factor - 90%
Al-Hana=8/20This grocery-slash-eatery reminds me more of Cafe Istanbul in terms of its lighter traffic than that of Haji-Baba's eatery and market.  Some of the items on the shelves had a light blanket of dust...Ordered the beef kabob (2 pcs.) platter, with lettuce, onions, hummus, and two pitas.  The kabobs were tasty, even though they were slightly overdone in temperature.  Liked the pitas, disliked the hummus.  I couldn't taste any flavors from the chickpeas, tahini, or spices.  Just that of an oil I couldn't even place its origin.  As I was finishing up the kabobs and pita, I spied two young men enjoying their beef shawarmas, so I ordered one to-go.  Got into my car and couldn't wait to have a bite...  I should've gone with my first choice (of beef shawarma)- this was a very tasty selection.  I'd come back to order it again.I also enjoyed a Lebanese baked dessert, almost cake-like, with two distinct layers- slightly sweet cheese, reminiscent of dried-out ricotta and cream cheese, on the bottom and golden-orange wheat (semolina?), topped with crushed pistachios.  A side sauce dish of simple syrup accompanied the dessert.  I had asked the woman behind the counter two times what the dish was called, and she didn't sound too confident in telling me that she knew it as "shmeer."  (It's the closest thing I could decipher.  Perhaps "shmeed" might be a better word... can anyone help me?)  The ff. is the closest image I found to what I think I had.  (If so, then my dessert was missing the ashtar topping, a type of clotted cream, pictured below.)  The dessert I bought doesn't even come close to approaching the wow factor of this link's image... Kanefe/Knefeh.http://grabyourfork.blogspot.com/2007/08/rabeih-sweets-punchbowl.htmlAfter Yelp Office Hours on Tuesday (Thanks Again Gabi! :-), Mr. K, Brian S and I decided that we needed lunch...were to go?...were...to...go?We were sort of in the neighborhood of Al-Hana, (OK, not really, but close enough) and it won out over some of the other suggestions...and I'm glad it did:)We all like discovering new places and this little spot takes some discovering:)If you don't know that it's inside Baiz market, you will never discover Al-Hana...and that would be a shame:)Much like the cafe at Ranch Market (just up the street) this little cafe is a genuine delight embedded in this small grocery market (with, apparently, no end of interesting food items and sundries in its aisles:)One of the more interesting things I noted, during our visit, was the sizable inventory of hookah's, under lock and key, in the front of the store:)They must have 50 of these things in stock!I'm not a hookah marketing expert, but if asked about inventory management of hookah's, I would have said "hold on there, Earl, I think 3 or 4 hookah's in stock is plenty" :-)So, imagine my surprise and delight, when, during a one hour lunch, I saw 2 of these water pipes walk out the door, accompanied by all sorts of tobacco cans, and other paraphenalia:)And, these hookah's aren't cheap...sticker price looks to be around $200 for the low end models (I really can't tell high end from low end, with hookah's...I'm just going with size as the differentiator:-)What is cheap at Al-Hana/Baiz is lunch...cheap and delightful:)I had Chicken Shawarma and fries (I know...intriguing combo:)...quite tasty:)I got a chance to sample Brian's Hummus and Babaghannuj and I looked over the menu for future visits...because there will be future visits:)The menu includes kabob's, whole roasted chickens, delightful little meat pies ($.69 each...wow!:), and whole host of middle eastern delights...and fries:)And last, but not least, the staff at Al-Hana is so friendly, smiling and eager to please:)It's a stark contrast to the places that think it's enough to just take your order and toss your food at you...the nice people that took care of me just didn't stop smiling the entire time I was there...and I didn't even have spinach in my teeth...this time:)Half-way between Roosevelt and Van Buren on 20th St.It's worth making the trip:)"Do you like Middle Eastern food?" This question started my impromptu tour of Cool Places I Didn't Know Existed in Phoenix.  Uh, wait... where are we?  A grocery store?  I like it!Al-Hana is located within Baiz Market - if you didn't know that, you would probably never find it.  Walking inside, I was immediately taken with the scent of exotic spices, and the interesting combination of hookahs and religious artwork for sale.  I could have spent way longer lingering in the aisles - they have items that I haven't seen elsewhere, and at very reasonable prices.    The dining area is a simple order-at-the-counter setup, with a small collection of tables and chairs.  It is easy to see that everything is made fresh on-site, since the brick oven is right behind the counter and you can watch the goodness happen.  Ooohhh... the food...  babaghannuj with fresh pita, chicken shawarma, and adorable meat pies.  Oh yes!  The more I ate, the happier I was.  By the end, I was smiling and waving at the guys working the brick oven.  You are awesome!  Oh, and the whole table full of delights was only $12...  Too bad I ran out of stomach real estate (and was actually stuffed for the rest of the day) - so many other things I want to try and buy...  little pies that look like pizza... baklava (OK, actually the entire dessert case in the back of the store)... and the cheese, glorious cheese!This makes me wonder, what other hidden gems are out there, waiting to be found?I'm writing this update on Al-Hana to let everyone know they've made some changes recently and for the BEST! The Baiz Market is pretty much the same.  It's a wonderful Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food market and THE BEST place to buy olives, oils, middle eastern spices and pita bread!!  2 for $1and it's fresh daily! Al-Hana~ "take a deep inhale as you enter the Baiz market, awe...." It's the same wonderful aroma and quality of food but they've made some changes to their menu.  Yes, that's right I said menu.  They have menu's now!  They are nicely done with full color pics of most dishes so no more guessing and no need for an interrupter!Their dishes have changed.  They've added rice to most of their dishes at no extra charge. In fact they lowered their prices on a lot of things and changed up a lot of their entries to include rice, hummus and garlic sauce! The chicken and beef schawarma are both some of the best in town but I prefer the Shish Taook ~ two huge skewers of grilled to perfection chicken seasoned in taook spices on top of a large bed of seasoned and delicious rice served with hummus, mixed pickles, tomatoes and their garlic sauce.  It is a HUMONGOUS plate full of tasty goodness that comes with two fresh pitas on top.  It's enough food for two people, people!  So be ready to share.  Their garlic sauce and hummus are as good or better than anyone else's their Shish Taook will leave you wanting!I also recommend getting some of their small meat, cheese or cheese with spinach pies, the small square ones that are folded, heated for an appetizer and share a plate of hummus.  Their small pies are full of flavor and the pie dough is awesome!! Plan to par-ooze the market while you wait for your food.  Skip the pepsi coolers near the Al-Hana counter for your beverage and pick a beverage from the large coolers on the first aisle leading back to the produce.  This is where you'll find just about anything and everything from the middle east to drink.  Yes!They still have the same wonderful team of two guys cooking and the young lady running 100 MPH taking orders and serving everyone all at once.  They have made some fantastic changes and they one of THE BEST places to go for your Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food fixes.  I hope to see you there!Oh my!!  Not only was this some of the best Middle Eastern food I've had in Phoenix, but it's rates right up there with some the best food ever!  And for cheap!  Met up here for lunch today with Rand H, Mike C and Arlin B and even though it's in a crappy part of town, it was well worth it.  We started with some of the little pies, we had the meat, and the spinah/cheese.  Different than other pies I have had at Middle Eastern places, these were made with a tasty dough instead of the layered sheets of whatever they use.  The fillings were seasoned and fantastic, so good I bought a dozen to take home!  99cents for one, 8.99 a dozen, how can you beat that price?! We also all shared a plate of hummus that was delicious, creamy and tasted like hummus should.  For my meal I ordered the beef shawerma plate, but was already full from the other goodies I brought most of it home.  While the meat looked like it was burnt, it was nothing but tender and seasoned just right.  Oh...and everything came with what seemed a stack of fresh made pitas!  Hours later I'm still in that happy food coma place and I'm already planning my next visit.I used to love you, Al-Hana.  I have fond memories of enjoying good food and good company while sitting at your little wobbly tables and chairs.  I fell in love with your babaghannuj.  Yes, you had a lot going for you.I was disappointed, but kept coming back, when you decided to raise the price on Every Single Item I Like, while making all of the portions smaller.  I understood that you have to pay for those new glossy menus with the pretty pictures somehow even though I liked the old menu board with the plastic letters just fine, thanks.  I settled for slow and sometimes surly service from your staff.  Why?  Because I loved you. Well, I think our one-sided relationship has come to an end.  That last visit - you know, the one where you gave our food to another customer (uh, you were confused?), and left us waiting for over 35 minutes without an apology while fulfilling orders for people who arrived and ordered much much later?  That will be my last one.  I especially will cherish the charming way in which the 'manager' grudgingly provided a refund for the food I never received.  "Do you want to return the water as well?"  Um, no.  Since I had to get it out of the cooler myself, I actually received that portion of what I ordered.  Thanks.Keep your rising prices and shrinking portions.  You are no longer worth my affection.----------------CASH Preferred.  Credit Card -- $10 minimum---------------This is important if you're a single as most things on the menu are less than $10.     This place does not have filtered water or even water from a tap.  So, don't forget to grab your drink and pay for it with your food.  I didn't realize I could not get a cup of water when I ordered/paid for my food, so I ended up drinking a bottle of warm water in my car when I was done eating.  Meh.This restaurant is down a street I would never drive down.  Most people would probably never pass this store in their commute to any place in the Valley.  The restaurant itself is located inside of a middle eastern (maybe Islamic/Kosher/?? as there are no pork products in this store) grocery store.  You will not see the name "Al-Hana" on the outside when you drive up, so don't be confused.I had lunch here last week with the Yelper lunch UYE group with Rand H. I tried their chicken schwarma and the fatoosh.  Both tasted very good to me.  I thought the chicken was over cooked, but the flavor was still there and exceptionally good.  The fun part about eating here is exploring the grocery store and standing out like a sore thumb.  I loved checking out all the products.  The herbs and spices you find in whole foods for astronomical prices are not so expensive in there.I would love to go back and try this place, when I have cash on me.  I hope the 2nd time is the charm!----------------CASH Preferred.  Credit Card -- $10 minimum---------------
Maru Korean BBQ & Sushi=I have never had the sushi here, my review is based only on my Korean food experience at Maru.It doesn't compare to Mom's cooking, but it definitely satisfies my Korean food craving on those nights when Chinatown is just too far. The interior is very nice and always clean when I have been here. I usually order:-pajun (kimchi pancake)-seafood soondubu (spicy tofu soup)-dolsot bibimbap (hot stone bibimbap)Servers are friendly and the food is consistent. Banchan has been fresh everytime as well. Until there are more Korean options in Summerlin I will definitely continue to come to Maru, and even then, keep it in my rotation.
Essence of Thai=Essence of Thai is pretty decent Thai food despite the fact that they have Crap Rangoon with imitation crap listed as an appetizer.I brought a coworker here while we were in Las Vegas on a business trip.  He had never had Thai food and his first experience he opened the menu and spotted the Crap Rangoon straightaway.That made for some barely controlled guffawing.  Nice.  So this is the food you wanted to introduce me to?Moving on, we shared some chicken satay.  It was very good with a mild bite and great yellow curry flavor.  I ordered the panang curry and my coworker ordered a beef stir fry sort of thing.  He reported it was good with no signs of crap.The panang curry was nice.  I ordered it 5 out of 10 on the spiciness scale since I had never eaten here before.  I would go more like 7 or 8 if you like it hot.  The dish was very good.  The shrimp were tender and juicy, not sproingy and overdone as sometimes happens.I also had a Thai iced tea which was yummy although not as strongly flavored as most Thai restaurants version.Overall, I would dine at Essence of Thai again.  Skip the crap though.
Thai Basil=Remember the movie Brokedown Palace with Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale? And all of the Thai people were so mean to them. Oh. It has nothing to do with this review. I was just asking if you remembered that movie. Anyway, you won't find mean Thai people here. It's definitely a team  effort here and everyone was very helpful and most friendly. Seating is rather awkward as their isn't any signage indicating what to do, wait or sit. Or order inside. But I was quickly invited to sit wherever. Before I knew it a cold, crisp, simple salad and a menu was place in front of me. Yay! Free salad. The dressing was SO good. I bet Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes didn't get free salad. Course they were too busy being pistol whipped by the prison guards. Anyhoo...I ordered the pad thai and it was fantastic. Though I would have loved more tofu. It came with the cutest little spring and a wedge of cold watermelon. YUM! Love watermelon as it so refreshing. All this for around eight bucks. I bet you Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes...oh...never mind. Just get your butt to Thai Basil. Where you will be greeted warmly, served efficiently and probably, won't get pistol whipped by a lesbian Thai prison guard.I love ordering their food Thai-Hot (thats the hottest you can get here). If you like you're food spicy, you can't go wrong. Their pre-meal salads; which come with every dine-in meal, has an awesome salad dressing. They also sell their salad dressing for ($5) to take home. I forget how many oz. they said it was. I think its close to 12 or 16, but don't quote me on it. Every meal seems to come with a slice of fresh cut watermellon.  The watermellon is a nice refreshing pre or post meal snack and also light on the added calories; although the rest of the meal may not be.My favorite dish is their garlic dish; either rice or noodle, ive had it with chicken and tofu before. The tofu is prepared in such a way that it has a crispy outside and a buttery inside. I don't think that I've ever ordered a tofu dish before and thought "I might order this again some time." Their lunch meals will cost you about $10-$11 after tax + tip, so I don't visit all the time, but they are a great choice if you can't stop thinking about thai food and you're in the midtown area near central ave and thomas.
Gingerroot=Nice atmosphere, but TFC (The Filipino Channel) on the tube set on VERY LOUD quickly ruins the good vibes for me.  I start to wonder what the non-Filipino customers think of the shows' quality, but then I recall Judge Judy, Montel, COPS, etc., that air on TV and I don't feel so embarrassed.Food are set out buffet-style or "turo-turo" (you point at the food you want), and I quickly learn that the daily lunch specials' menu printed and displayed on an easel outdoors by the entrance doesn't accurately depict what you're going to find served indoors.  Friday's menu listed a dish that wasn't offered bec. apparently it was served the day before and another dish was offered in its place.  (Why even bother printing out a menu if you're not going to stick to it?  Guess I better call ahead before making the trip from Laveen.)  One dish stood out, and I asked the server if it contained any meat, to w/c he replied just "ginataang kalabasa" (aka squash simmered in coconut milk).  I was starving, and aside from the "bistek" (pan-fried slices of beef steak) and "pritong tilapia at galungong" (fried tilapia and scad), nothing much interested me here.  So for my lunch combo, I chose fried tilapia and rice w/ squash, green beans, and okra simmered in coconut milk for my veggies.  I was having a good time eating my lunch until I noticed that there were shrimp (allergy) in the squash dish... The server apparently was not aware it had meat in it, could not verify if it was shrimp, and had to ask the owner/cook to confirm.  I thought this an unacceptable practice; it's a good thing for him that I am not a vegetarian, and a very good thing for the venue's cook/owner that I am not deathly allergic to shrimp, at least not yet.The owner/cook gladly replaced the squash dish for beef steak (w/c tasted fine, albeit salty and VERY greasy), although my original buffet server was not pleased.  This irked me- what does it matter to him that she replaced a dish bec, he was negligent of the original's ingredients?  Perhaps he felt embarrassed that he couldn't even tell there was shrimp in it, but why show discontent?  Oh, he really made my blood boil!  I'll try to visit again to try other lunch specials and see if the service improves.  Otherwise, I may just spend my money at Jeepney Bistro and Lumpia Factory down the road (where my eardrums won't be tormented by untalented comics on "Wowowee").  I do have one positive thing to say about Gingerroot- its rice was whiter, fluffier, and better in quality than that of Lumpia Factory, w/c was yellowed, drier, and just plain sorry-looking enough for me not to take home to re-hash in "sinangag" (rice fried with garlic... yum!).I do hope that the dinner service and menu are several times' better than that of lunch... Menu prices made me laugh... Gingerroot's ambience definitely places it at the top of the list of all the other Filipino venues in Chandler if you're on a date, but I'd very much dislike the experience if I'm forced to listen and watch TFC and have buffet food at those prices!
Amena Bakery & Deli=Dang! I wanted to be the first to write a review and TWO people beat me to it! This place has great, fresh, healthy food! They day I went, they'd only been open for 4 days and they were a little discombobulated. Serving spoons were nowhere to be found, so the folks working there were trying to use tiny plastic spoons to fill big heaping containers. Their cash register was broken too.But from my first taste of baklava, nothing else mattered but the food. The baklava is luscious. It's some of the best I've ever had. It's not gloopy and not cloyingly sweet. The taste of nuts and honey and flakey pastry all come through.Then I tried their veggie soup. It was nothing fancy, but somehow heart-warming soul food in soup form. The Manoshet White Cheese pita/pizza like thing (fiteer for those who know the language) was outstanding. The pitas are fresh baked every day using organic flour. I could eat the Manoshet 3x/day and it would be a long time before I'd tire of it.The Nazarene Salad was a standout. Cabbage, carrots, sesame seeds and bell pepper in a tasty homemade dressing. I do want to suggest they add a combo plate of salads but as friendly as these folks are, I bet they'd make one just for you even if it isn't on the menu.The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was the atmosphere. I'm not so inclined to eat in and much more inclined to get take out. But the food is some of the best to be found in Vegas.I found Amena thanks to Yelp -- again - (Poly A, your review was terrific and convinced me particularly when comparing your notes on Habib's, that I should give them a shot).   So this Easter Sunday, when I realized I'd not ordered items for a party the next day, I remembered reading the review and headed over -- they were open -- Habib's wasn't.  I explained my situation to Amir -- what a great guy.  He and his niece were thoughtful and caring -- beyond generous.  I think they offered me samples of everything in the place.  And even offered to make items I needed that were not on their menu.   I arranged for pick up the next day at 2:00 (meat, cheese and spinach pies, stuffed grape leaves, falafel, tahini, pita bread, baklava, these round phyllo cookies that were crispy, sticky, sweet and cinnamony and just incredible, as well as little chocolate "quickers").   My staff had made lots of the items we served at the Persian-themed party, but there were some things that were just too hard for them to pull off -- hence the outsourcing.  I've not had tremendous luck finding good reliable sources since we've come to Vegas -- but these folks are the real deal.  And sure enough, yesterday at 2:00 sharp -- they were ready, and proud -- even found Persian music for me to use at the party!  Everything was delicious -- truly spectacular and reasonably priced.Bless the Chef's heart -- he looked exhausted, too.  I know my order was a tall one.  I did learn one thing that I thought was interesting that Poly hadn't mentioned -- the family is from Nazareth.  Amir used to be a local bank branch manager.  Anyone looking for a great lunch -- terrific falafel sandwiches, kebobs, etc -- like Poly said -- on freshly baked pita is in for a treat.  It's also a great spot for a dessert -- or to use them for takeout -- but probably best to get to know them and order in advance.   The shelves do seem a bit bare -- but trust me, engage the owner or the girls in a conversation -- ask him what he likes -- their food couldn't be fresher, or their hearts any bigger -- and when I see a family working this hard in this business with such passion, I can't help but want to spread the word...I stared Death in the face and ordered a falaffel sandwich.I was getting ready to leave Las Vegas. The TV weatherman's map showed the southern half of California being pounded under torrential rain.  The entire length of I15 back to California was colored red, and the forecast was for the storm to peak at 3 pm, exactly when I was supposed to leave for the 5 hour drive home.  The Weather Channel said there would be high wind warnings in effect and mentioned there would be the possibility of tornadoes along the road back to southern California.   Well, I thought, if I'm going to risk my life on the road during this storm, I want to make damn sure I have a decent last meal.  There was no doubt in my mind, I had to have a falaffel sandwich from Amena Bakery.I had just tried the place for the first time the day before, based on Misti Y's excellent review.  Her recommendation was, as the English say, spot on.   Amena's pita bread is heavenly.  Tender and light, but still strong enough to hold a bunch of falaffel patties and fixin's. And as Misti notes, they serve the falaffel sandwiches stuffed at Amena Bakery, none of that bogus folded pita nonsense here!  (hello Daphne's!)  The falaffel patties have a great initial crunch and a flavorful interior.  Absolutely delicious!  Each sandwich is made to order, so the patties are plenty warm when you get them.  When your sandwich is ready, you specify what toppings you want.   Without question, this was the best falaffel sandwich I've had in the last 20 years.So, now, as I was getting ready for my redicuously dangerous trip home, I was faced with that Yelp Profile question: what did I want for my last meal on Earth?  It came down to a Super Taco from La Takiza, or a falaffel sandwich from Amena Bakery.    They are both excellent, and I would have been happy to have either one in my belly when I kicked off.  I ended up picking Amena because there are plenty of taco places where I live, but nowhere to get a great falaffel sandwich.And Amena didn't disappoint!  The woman at the register remembered me from the day before.  She asked if I was going to try something new today.  I really wanted to try the shwarma, but I stuck with the falaffel.  I also purchased a couple baklavas.  I'm not a big baklava fan, but the free sample I got on my first visit was so delicious, I had to have more!  So crunchy and sweet!I can't wait to go back to Amena!  I'll have to go multiple times next time I'm in town because I really want to try the shwarma and other items on the menu, and I can't wait to get another falafflel sandwich. Mikey C says: Thanks for turning me on to Amena Bakery, Misti Y!  I love this place!Vegetarians rejoice! ...and Middle Eastern food fanatics!  This place is great!  I had long been craving sabich (ch pronounced like a hard hhhhhh, other transliterations use sabikh with a K) since the Israeli joint on Fort Apache and Sahara closed down over 3 years ago.  A little birdie told me Amena had sabich, so on a trek from UNLV to Centennial Hills, I stopped here for lunch.Fresh-made pita daily, this place smells good and has a wide variety of menu items including sandwiches with schawarma, falafel, lamb to veggie pies, hummus, lebneh, etc.  I stood in line and looked frantically for sabich on the menu, but it was not there.  However, the staff resassured me that it is available, "off-the-menu."Sabich is essentially a pita stuffed with eggplant, hard boiled egg, and amba (a sour mango spread).  Amena serves it with hummus instead of amba, and then allows you to stuff it with all of the healthy fixins': red cabbage, green cabbage, diced onions with a tomato paste similar to harissa with a hint of spice, cucumber, sliced onions, and pickles.  It was a MOUTHFUL!  The staff set s'chug (hot pepper paste) and tahini bottles on the table.  I also got a Mexican coke to drink.  The sandwich was overfull of deliciousness, endless flavors, crunchy fresh veggies, soft pillowly fresh pita, a variety of beautiful colors, hot and soft eggplant and eggs....drool!  Eating this...probably seemed like food porn to the rowdy group of Israeli guys at the table next to me, chattering away in Hebrew.  I am so coming back here and dragging Eric R. who loves middle eastern food and fresh pita!!!  And for all of the curious readers out there, the word for tasty in Hebrew is "ta-im!"Went to TJ's hungry and instead of picking up some of their prepared food to eat (E Coli outbreak) I decided to check this spot out. At first, the word 'Deli' had me excited for a sammie, but as I got closer I saw other signs for 'Shawarma' & 'Falafel'. Holy excitement. The place itself isn't much with just a few tables strewn about. One side has freshly made pitas lined up on a table and a case serving baked goods. The other side was the 'deli' section serving all sorts of Mediterranean delights. Beef, chicken, lamb shawarma, falafel, lentil soup, homemade hummus, etc..  I scooped up a chicken shawarma plate ($11.99) which came with sides of hummus, a small salad and two pitas. There was certainly a good amount of food for the price and I walked away full. The salad was OK, typical Israeli style with lots of cukes. The chicken was moist, sliced nicely and had that wonderful  shawarma spice to it. The only knock is that it was wayyyyy over salted. Highlight of the dish was the hummus. . Shawarma, earmuffs!.... I knocked back two fantastic pitas in that hummus. So good.  Def stop by if you dig the Mediterranean meats vibe.The food was actually pretty great but their customer service was terrible! Earlier that day I had a coworker bring me lentil soup from this restaurant which was the best I have tried so I decided that I would actually go there for lunch. Upon entering the establishment I did notice there were a handful of people enjoying lunch so I kind of instantly thought it was going to be a great experience and since it was so close to work, I would probably make this a frequent place to eat. That actually would be the farthest thing from the truth!I walked up to the counter and was not acknowledged for several minutes even though the women working behind the counter made eye contact with me several times. I reviewed the menu and decided on the lamb gyro platter and was going to be also getting a side of hummus to go for the girls at work. After a few more minutes a middle eastern couple came in and instantly the lady behind the counter said to them "Hello" and they replied hello back, still nothing was said to me, they started to talk in a language that I did not understand which was no big deal and they all looked at me, so the worker comes up and said "yes what would you like" I placed my order and also added an iced tea and went to have a seat. The couple ordered their food and sat down. 2 other middle eastern guys came in, immediately placed their order, the lady came from behind the counter gave them a hug, seemed friendly here. A white couple came in stood at the counter for exactly 8 minutes, I timed it and was never greeted and then they left without ordering anything. The 2 gentlemen that came in long after me were served their food first, then the couple immediately behind me received their food next which did include stuff that looked to have been cooked longer than lamb gyro meat. It was about 40 minutes after I sat down that I finally received my gyro that was not put together at all, I guess you have to build your own here.  I asked for my drink and she was all "Oh I forgot" then after she dropped it off I asked if there was any way she could bring me silverware and the hummus I ordered?  She laughed came back and literally dropped it on my table!  Nothing to go with the hummus either so I ended up having to go to Trader Joes after I finished my Gyro so that we had something to eat the hummus with.  A few other people came in that were not caucasian and were promptly greeted and served faster than I was.  Although I look caucasian, I am mixed but feel this is the first time someone discriminated against me for being part white! I know that sounds ridiculous but also witnessing the caucasian couple not be acknowledged at all makes me believe that these people really do not want anyone in here that cannot speak their language.As i was leaving I did see the lady behind the counter and say "Thank you, have a nice day" and she just looked away.
Bourbon Steak=My husband and I chose to kick off the first ever Phoenix Restaurant Week at Bourbon Steak in the beautiful Fairmont Scottsdale Princess.  While the ambiance of the restaurant is somewhat fun, the food and service do not have me running back.The restaurant itself is done in a very modern white theme and its very large.  There are several dining rooms (some that are more tucked away than others as well as a large dining room), a bar/lounge area, and a rather inviting looking patio.  I remarked on the way in that it would make the perfect place for a group dinner- its fun, lively, and can easily accommodate a large party.  (If you are looking for a romantic evening, this probably isn't your spot).  The selection of music is questionable, as we heard a range that went from Jack Johnson to Snow Patrol to the Eagles to 80s.  The service left much to be desired.  We waited entirely too long to place our orders, so much so that the duck fat fries and foccacia had already been brought to the table by the time we did.  (We also waited for water for entirely too long...water should be put on the table moments after we are seated).  Once we had placed our drink orders our two glasses of wine took a bit to get to us.  Our table wasn't properly set (a huge pet peeve of mine in restaurants) and we had to ask our server for plates to enjoy the foccacia and fries.  Throughout the night the service was spotty at best.The duck fat fries were very crunchy, yet very good, according to my husband.  (Being allergic to duck I was not able to enjoy them, but I much appreciated the fact that it was announced they were cooked in duck fat when brought to the table.  But then again most upscale restaurants announce the dish and method of preparation when delivering it).  The foccacia was great.  I selected the heirloom tomato appetizer with Burrata cheese which was lovely, and my husband enjoyed his soup (which he found to be sweet) and his mini grilled cheese.  We were both disappointed with our entrees however.  My husband selected the skirt steak which was fatty and very tough to eat.  I know that is the nature of the cut, however, I have had skirt steak that has literally melted in my mouth.  My prime beef short rib was good, but alas, prime rib is prime rib and when I eat it I always feel as if I'm at a wedding.  We had also ordered a side of their truffled mac and cheese which was perhaps the most disappointing part of the meal.  When I order gourmet mac and cheese I'm doing it because I want to indulge...there was nothing indulgent or decadent about this mac and cheese.  It was practically flavorless actually. Of all the mac and cheese side dishes I have ordered in my life (and trust me, there has been a lot), this was my least favorite.  In fact, we didn't even finish it.  Dessert was delicious, even if my beignets were more like zeppole.  My husband loved the vanilla pot du creme which was caramelized perfectly on top.  His trio of ice creams was unremarkable.The regular menu is a la carte style and was actually more reasonably priced than I had expected.  Although Yelp has it listed as a "dressy" restaurant there were people in jeans there.  (I don't think there are actual "dressy" restaurants in Phoenix....)   Now, yes, this is Restaurant Week and I do understand that sometimes restaurants can be overwhelmed with people.  Bourbon Steak was not full by any means (we were the only people seated in our section for quite some time) and I can't imagine our server had more than 2 other tables.  I also understand that the menu options are being produced en masse.  However, in selecting the menu one would expect a restaurant to choose dishes that they know that they can make en masse and make them well.  Restaurant Week is supposed to entice the customer to come back for more, but I have to say that I don't think the quality of food warrants a second visit anytime soon.Writing this a little late, but we came here during Restaurant Week. We were seated in a small dining area, which felt closed off from the rest of the restaurant. I wasn't a fan of the lighting. I felt like I was in a fitting room. Anyway the service here was great. Our waiter explained both the Restaurant Week menu and their regular menu. They immediately brought us the duck fat fries and 3 dipping sauces. I love them all. The french fries were great. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. This is a great starter. We tried the cauliflower veloute and the beef carpaccio for our appetizers. The carpaccio was ok. It did have too many unnecessary ingredients. The cauliflower veloute however was divine. It was so smooth and creamy. It included a lobster fritter and pieces of apple. I could have had a bucket of this for dinner and have been in heaven. We also received some focaccia bread with out appetizers. It was so warm and buttery. We hadn't even had our actual dinner yet and we were getting full. They certainly give your your monies worth. We both ordered the flat iron and short rib for our entrees. We got a little bit of each, which was just enough since we had quite a few other things to eat on the table. The flat iron steak was juicy and flavorful. The short rib was tender but just not as appealing as the steak. Lastly we shared the mascarpone cheesecake and the beignets with the butterscotch creme. Both were delicious. The beignets came with more than enough creme so we took a bit and layered it on top of the cheesecake. Yum. Nice place for dinner. I love coming to the Princess to lounge and have after dinner drinks. The open air bar with their huge lounge area is a great place to come on a nice night and enjoy our beautiful weather.My husband and I enjoyed dining here on NYE and it was extremely delicious! This restaurant is situated inside the Princess and has a great atmosphere. It's lively and overlooks one of the pools. It's much more open and airy than other steakhouses. The service was excellent and we were treated to five star customer service from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. Once our waiter learned that I was expecting he made sure to only serve me food that was pregnancy approved as well! The only downfall of the night was when we arrived and learned that it was a required prix-fixe meal. We made our reservations several weeks in advance and when we did, they didn't mention the mandatory prix-fixe meal. They called us two days prior to our reservation to confirm and when we spoke with them they still didn't mention the prix-fixe. It wasn't until we were seated on NYE that the waiter placed the menu in front of us and we learned that we didn't have the option to simply order off the menu. This resulted in the meal being much more expensive then we planned and it also limited us from getting to enjoy the items on the menu we would have liked to (I was itching to try the Lobster pot pie). The meal ended up being spectacular and we enjoyed a several hour event with five courses of sublime food, but it would have still been nice to have been warned prior to the meal. However, because this was NYE and a special night out, we looked past the prix-fixe issues and thoroughly enjoyed our night! The meal was fun and delicious and we enjoyed the Princess NYE party after the meal which was free for guests and diners of the restaurant to attend. I would definitely recommend a visit to Bourbon Steak but if it's a holiday, confirm their menu with them first!
Table 10="BAM"!Emeril...take that BAM back because this place was not all that.  It was decent, but I expected more from you.We get there around happy  hour and start off with a couple of mojitos and chips & salsa.  The chips & salsa appetizer is HUGE, and for $5...a good deal.  I opt for the pulled pork sandwich (with carnitas) and fried pickles.  Husband gets the burger.  I get the concept of the carnitas in a bbq pulled pork sandwich, but I just wasn't too impressed with it.  The fried pickles on the other hand were phenomenal!  My husbands burger was good, but I wouldn't say it was anything special.  Service at Table 10 was excellent.  Our server was very attentive, and refills were never an issue.  There's better places to eat in Vegas, but if you're staying at The Palazzo and looking for a spot during happy hour...this place will do.  They have tvs around the bar with various sports playing, and I must add the mojitos we had were really good.(3.5 stars)Table 10 is located in The Palazzo and it is one of Emeril Lagasse's Las Vegas restaurants.  The restaurant sits in a little shopping/restaurant area of The Palazzo that is a good distance away from the casino.The decor is eclectic but not over the top.  It is a dark space with mostly dark browns (hardwood floor, high bar stools, half booths, walls, etc.).  There are splashes of color though as well as prominent but not ghastly decoration.  The overhead light fixtures are modern and alternate in color (blues and yellows).  Lots of design throughout the room with patterns in the bar seat cushions and the backs of the booths.  Also, the table tops are decorated in multi-colored tiles.  Some metal decoration too including a wrought iron spiral staircase at the center of the bar, which I think heads to nowhere.The complimentary bread was a brioche roll, which was pretty good.  The crust was not much of a crust--kind of like the crust of a normal dinner roll.  There was a pretty good soft and flavorful brioche center that went well with butter.I started with the Seared Maine Sea Scallops With Crispy Fried Leeks, Lobster Tail And Salsa Provencal.  Las Vegas restaurants tend to be very overpriced, but I felt they actually could have charged more for this dish.  For the price, there was a generous portion of seafood (scallops and lobster).  The quality was great too.  The scallops had a nice caramelized sear with a tender and moist inside (though the scallops were a little gritty).  The lobster was tender and sweet. The fried leeks went great with the seafood.  They were very crisp, but they were not oily or greasy.  Good onion flavor.  The sauce was the base of the plate and it consisted of oil, tomato and olives (the olive flavor was very strong).  The sauce had a little bit of spice to it.  The sauce was not bad though not the best flavor and I did not think it complimented the dish (the seafood stood out fine by itself).My entree was seared tuna on a crispy corn cake over a tomato confit base.  The tuna portion was small (though it was a lunch dish).  The tuna was good.  Nice sear on the outside with a rare center.  The crispy corn cake had a crunchy outside and a sweet corn center.  The tomato confit base was kind of like a warmed up salsa and I was not a big fan of it (the sauce really reminded me of a tomato sauce I had at Xiomara Melrose so maybe this cuisine/style is just not for me).  While the tuna was good and everything was cooked properly, the resulting flavors did not really go together that well.I think my disappointment with both sauces/flavors had a lot to due with how each dish had a flavor/ingredient that stood out too much--olive for the starter and tomato for the entree (and not necessarily the best flavor/representation of those ingredients).  It could just be a matter of preference.  They did use very good quality seafood ingredients so I could see how these dishes might appeal more to others.Service was good.  The waiter was soft-spoken, polite and attentive.  Food came out at a good pace.I have never been to an Emeril Lagasse restaurant before so I do not know how this one stacks up to his other locations.  For lunch, the ingredients they use here are better than some of the other Vegas restaurants serving lunch in the same price range.  There are definitely some positives here and it might be worth trying if you are a fan of Emeril Lagasse (or are curious about his food).I walked here, but I imagine The Palazzo has complimentary valet and self-parking like other major Las Vegas hotels/casinos.I can't believe I waited so long to enjoy a meal here! I came here on Sunday after seeing the huge line at the Grand Lux on Sunday. Apparently they are trying a breakfast buffet which attracted a different vibe than I was going for as I was entertaining my future sister in law... The Vibe at table 10 was perfect! Quiet enough to have a conversation and still considered a casual lunch. Service: Absolutely fabulous. I made sure to let the manager know before I left.  My water glass was never half full and the server made sure I was informed on the Sunday menu special. Food: Hummus was great! The salad was slightly smaller than I expected, but I was still plenty full by the end of the meal. I recommend adding chicken if you are making a meal of it. Dessert: I had tea so it wasn't chocolate cake... but it was great! They have a nice selection of teas. They aren't exactly a vegetarian's paradise, but they have plenty of options.Items Experienced:Warm Rolls with ButterCrab Hush Puppies - Pepper JellyJudith Point Calamari - Preserved Lemon Mayonnaise + Tomato SauceCandied North Country Bacon - Noble Tonic #1Bacon Wrapped Dates - Almond + Goat CheeseLouisiana crab cakes - NOLA remouladeFried Green Tomatoes - Shrimp RemouladeChicken + Andouille Sausage Gumbo - Steamed RicePea Tortellini - Blistered Tomatoes + Smoky Pork BrothTomato Soup - Ricotta CheeseBeet Salad - Pickled beets - roasted beets - pistachio butter - sea salt cracker - goat cheeseNOLA Shrimp Po' Boy - French bread - New Orleans BBQ shrimp - lettuce - tomato - friesChicken Breast Sandwich - ciabatta bun - avocado slices - tomato jam - gem lettuce salad with onion, tomato, & cucumberEmeril's Banana Cream Pie - Chocolate Shavings - Caramel Sauce - Whipped CreamFlourless Chocolate Cake - Lemon - Vanilla Cream - Blood Orange SauceSpice Carrot Cake - orange bourbon sauce - candied pecansWhite Chocolate Malassadas - cinnamon sugar - raspberry saucePeach Hand Pie - crumble topping - vanilla ice creamRaspberry Panna Cotta - salted brittle - chocolate pistachio biscottoHaving visited each of Emeril Legasse's Las Vegas restaurants at least once in the past it was with family in town that lunch was planned at Table 10, and sitting with three local friends involved in marketing the celebrity Chef it was to a grand tasting that our table of eight was treated, a kitchen-in-transition showing the same quality we'd come to expect from the man who made "BAM!" a household phase.Currently in the process of promoting a new chef and as such cooked for by Director of Culinary Operations Sean Roe, it was with conversations and reminiscence of my earliest years of fine dining that menus were perused and drinks were ordered, the eventual decision a carte blanche assortment of eighteen plates with several very high highs and only one or two relatively minor lows.No doubt an underregarded space, the shops above the Palazzo gaming floor more readily known for pricy clothing, burgers, and coal-oven pies, Table 10 suffers a bit of an identity crisis compared to Delmonico or the Fish House, yet with a dynamic menu loaded with bargains plus professional service in a laid-back environment the experience is perhaps best described as 'comfortable,' a similar compliment befitting the food.Beginning the meal with soft buttered rolls that continue a trend of great bread service from other Emeril spots, it was next to several small bites that the menu progressed, the Squid from Judith Point a bit lost in the breading let alone the mayonnaise while hush puppies, candied bacon, and stuffed dates were each well prepared American small-plates starters, the first particularly ample with crustacean that shined when matched to the jelly's sweet heat.Onward to proper appetizers, the daily special soup impressing my Aunt but falling a bit short in complexity for my tastes, better bites were found more Southern-slanted flavors including low-filler crab cakes and fried green tomatoes beneath a duo of tangy remoulades, the spice of Andouille well met by dark roux in a gumbo served atop rice.Offering mostly sandwiches and lighter fare at lunch, the dinner menu dressed up in duck and other hearty meats, it was with a beautiful beet salad that two sandwiches were presented atop NOLA-styled bread, each Po-Boy going over nicely with the family while I attempted to keep tender pea tortellini rich with mascarpone in a smoky broth all to myself.Unembarrassed to request all of the desserts, a second round offered when the world-renowned cream pie and spicy carrot cake were obviously in short supply, suffice it to say that there is always room for sweets in any Legasse restaurant, even the simple peach hand pies and bursting white doughnuts amongst the best in town.Perhaps a 'misunderstood' spot as much as it is underregarded the team at Table 10 is turning out a good product at a fair price for the strip with some of the best desserts in town.  Obviously in a transition phase at the moment it will be interesting to see how the restaurant evolves under the direction of a new toque, a dinner visit in order once the menu is revamped.Items Tasted:Sweet Roll with Salted ButterPraline Candied BaconRoasted Pumpkin Soup with Toasted Pumpkin SeedsNew Orleans BBQ ShrimpVietnamese Pork and Shrimp Spring RollsBahamian-style Redfish Ceviche.Salt Roasted Beet Salad with Pistachio Butter and Cypress Grove Goat CheeseSlow Roasted Wild Salmon with Roasted Creamy CauliflowerBarolo Braised Short Rib with Mascarpone Polenta, Baby Carrots andShaved Black TruffleChocolate Sheba Cake with White Chocolate AnglaiseGraciously invited by One7 Media to meet one of the very few Celebrity Chefs I hold near and dear to my heart it was on a rare Sunday night out that I joined three friends for some true "Event Dining," the launch of 'Essential Emeril' coinciding with the introduction of new Table 10 Chef du cuisine James Richards during an intimate 60ish person private dinner on The Palazzzo's second floor.Greeted by several members of the Lagasse's Las Vegas team, Corporate Executive Chef Sean Roe telling us of the newly innovated Snack Bar just moments after we arrived, it was with Champagne or Punch that the evening began and with several of the Chef's classics featured as butler-served hors d'oeuvres whetting the palatr, a meet-and-greet with Emeril himself transitioned all to the dining room where things got kicked up a notch.Describing his new book as "the closest thing I'll ever do to an autobiography" while presenting each dish with anecdotes showing both humility and his own grinning gusto, it was with greeting from several friendly faces from Delmonico, The New Orleans Fish House, and even Lagasse's Stadium that the meal marched forth and reflecting on his earliest years the Roasted Beet Salad was cool, creamy, and aromatic - a heartiness in tune with cooler weather, and a sign of flavors to come.Telling a tale of Charlie Trotter, the man to whom he dedicated the book, before presenting slow roasted salmon that transcended typical through controlled cooking temperatures that yielded a perfectly flaky filet it must be noted that, although rare to imbibe, each wine was on par to the plate with which it was paired, a 2013 Merlot blend from Ornellaia showing a good deal of oak and acidity to compliment truffled shortribs braised fork-tender in Barolo.Mopping up the rest of the beef's juices and any remaining polenta with a buttery sweet roll it was with a lone dessert that the two-hour meal concluded, and citing an unlikely reference in French legend Pierre Gagnaire the Chocolate Sheba Cake walked a fine line between ganache and mousse-like with shaved nuts adding just a touch of texture alongside creamy pool of Anglaise.Thanked repeatedly by Chefs and Staff for our attendance, the gratitude flowing equally from our side of the plate, it was with a signed copy of the new book that each of us departed after again shaking hands with a true legend, a return visit to check out Chef Richards' menu update already being planned.A good spot for grubbin' on some of Emeril's best. I wouldn't have even known about this place if I hadn't seen a poster advertising their 4 courses for $48 deal in the Venetian elevator. It's a good price for a lot of food, most of it quite good. FIRST COURSEFLAME-ROASTED MARROW BONES: $11 for three giant bones. This was a great start t our meal, with the gelatinous gold spread onto baguette slices and sprinkled with sea salt. (Not part of the 4/$48)ROASTED PUMPKIN SOUP: I assume it's seasonal, and it is damn good. Get it while you can. This soup is surprisingly thick (like potato) yet smooth, with a light, rich flavor. The toasted pumpkin seeds and pumpkin oil added just the right bit of "extra" to keep it from being too simple.CHICKEN + ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE GUMBO: it's not my favorite version, but a passable one for the Strip location. Slightly spicy, surprisingly meaty, and served over soft white rice.SECOND COURSEEMERIL'S BBQ SHRIMP: Overcooked shrimp seemed like it had been sitting out, the NewOrleans barbecue glaze wasn't well-received by others at the table, and the rosemary biscuit had nice flavors but was hard and dry.SMOKEY MUSHROOM PASTA: A surprise hit! Fresh, perfectly al-dente pasta with tasso ham, smoked mushrooms, and parmesan cheese, with a zesty Cajun sauce. I could have done without the ham, and expected slightly more mushrooms given the name of the dish, but was pleasantly surprised by this dish.THIRD COURSE (MAINS)EMERIL'S PORK CHOP: served with caramelized sweet potatoes, which paired perfectly and went perfectly with the colder fall season. This was one of the best pork chops I've had, tender and juicy with plenty of flavor and a great seasoning/glaze. The menu description also mentions a "green chile mole" that I either didn't receive or that simply wasn't distinct from the other flavors on the plate.CARAMELIZED SEA SCALLOPS: Got this over the short rib at the suggestion of our server, and ended up really enjoying it. Light flavors and portion, consisting of 3 large scallops served on a smear (there really should have been more!) of a great cauliflower puree, with a sea of brown butter sauce, accented with raisins, marcona almonds, and capers. This was surprisingly well-balanced, I liked that the capers didn't overpower the other, milder ingredients. I do wish the scallops had a better sear, though.FOURTH COURSE (DESSERTS)BANANAS FOSTER BREAD PUDDING: A decent bread pudding, topped with two lonely slices of banana, with a caramel glaze and more whipped cream and chocolate shavings. A less successful banana-based dessert.EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE: Heavenly. A homemade crust topped with tons of fresh banana, a blanket of smoothly sweet banana cream, and decorated with chocolate curls, caramel sauce, and whipped cream. I would come back for this.Our server, Diana, was great at making suggestions and checking on us without being overbearing. Interior seating is dark and quiet with a date-night atmosphere. Large bar area offers a limited "bar bites" menu, and there is a HH available, but by far the best deal is their 4 course dinner.
Leena's Food=I've been eating here since it was still a falafel truck on Bigelow Boulevard.  Top-notch Middle Eastern/Mediterranean entrees.  The "Best Falafel in Pittsburgh" sign is not hyperbole (the falafel is perfectly spiced and fried a lovely golden-brown, and comes stuffed in a pita with sumac, pickle, tahini sauce, and an astonishing chopped salad with lemon in it), but don't let the glory of the falafel dissuade you from trying the gyros, the shwarma, or anything else.  The hummus is also very good -- lots of tahini (which I love), and drizzled with olive oil and homemade chopped pickled hot peppers.  Definitely a tasty treat anytime.Opening the restaurant and getting out of the back of the truck has let the menu expand, and now there are some entrees that it wouldn't be practical to cook and serve in a truck.  I particularly love the moussaka.Assuming you haven't already gorged yourself on hummus, falafel, and other delicious foods, you should also get a piece of baklava for the road.Leena's also has a sort of inspiring backstory.  The owner has had a lot of struggles in his life -- after coming to America, he was hit by a drunken driver and horribly injured years ago, his young daughter lost a hand in a terrible kitchen accident, and the city harassed the Oakland food trucks and basically drove them all out of business for a long time.  But the owner did not give up.  He opened his restaurant after his truck was driven out of business, and he is always so happy and optimistic despite all the obstacles fate has put in his path.  I would not have known about all the terrible things he's surmounted, but the Pitt newspaper ran a story about it when the restaurant opened up a couple years ago.  Leena's Food is a great restaurant, but it also is a physical embodiment of the American Dream, and the owner is one of the quiet heroes you find every day in Pittsburgh.
Da Giovanni=I am not from Montreal but i have seen the reviews and they weren't so pleasant. I had some suspicion about this restaurant but it was a long day and my mother and i were very hungry and wanted a good early dinner. the outside doesn't seem like it was the best place to eat and once you walked in they had barely any customers. We were greeted by the waiter who seated us very quickly, handed us the menu.. He seemed nice and notice we were Americans and told us if we had any question to just ask. Once we looking over the selection two very strange guys came into the restaurant and i could immediately tell they were on drugs. i think the other people in the restaurant could tell also. Once our waiter seen the worried looks on me and my mothers face he made sure they we would have a pleasant time and catered to us. I ordered the Carbonara ( w/ bacon)  which by some reviews a lot of people didn't enjoy and my mother had Festin Italien ( Spaghetti w/ meatball , sausage and Cheese bread). I enjoyed the Carbonara, it was so delicious, My mother enjoyed her food as well. Even thou those strange people were around us i can't say that it wasn't a good meal. The staff were very professional and handle the situation very well and catered to me and my mother and very well. Hopefully people give this restaurant another chance i believe they deserve it.
The Mad Greek Cafe=Disclaimer: This review might offend you if you aren't Greek and take jokes too seriously. They should call this place The Bad Greek. Actually, maybe the name is a warning... "if you arrive here a happy Greek once you try our terrible food you will leave a Mad Greek".  I don't know who is back there making the food, but the cook should be sent to live with the Turks in Cyprus for being so impressively bad at being Greek. Maybe this place was opened by a Turkish housewife as a passive-aggressive jab at the Greeks. I could sit and do nothing but speculate all day as to how these people got so truly terrible at life, but then I would get hungry eventually, which might cause me to need to eat more of their crappy food.Kidding aside, we Greeks are a very hungry people.  If you are luring starving Greeks to your establishment, the most important thing you should know is that eating is not a joke to us.  So don't burn the freaking spanakopita.  Especially if you didn't even bother to put more than a half teaspoon of filling in it... ESPECIALLY if one of the minuscule four burnt "spinach pie" nibblets doesn't even have the correct filling in it!!!  Did someone drop some jam in there?  Why was it sweet??  And why did the nibblets consist of almost nothing but burnt phyllo dough?!  This I do not like. This is merely a reminder of what could have been.Everything else was mediocre at best...Pre-made cheap Italian dressing on my Anatolia salad that you can't call a "salata" unless you want to confuse them.Dolmades piled sloppily under a sea of bland mystery sauce, loosely rolled as though they were Taco Bell burritos, filled with unvarying smoosh and what appeared to be instant rice.Pre-crumbled feta... WTF?  Are they really so lazy that they cringe at the prospect of clasping their hand a few times to break up some blocks of feta?!None of this should matter to any Greek reading this... Because they had the audacity to serve me badly burnt spanakopita with no filling.  It was like a pastry version of the worst frozen potstickers you've ever eaten.  How dare they!!What they have created in the charliefoxtrot (clusterfffff) that is The Mad Greek is worse than spitting on my food... They have spit on my soul.  Don't mess with hungry Greeks!!!  Not cool.  Every time someone goes here to eat someone's yiayia drops dead... So save a yiayia and don't ever eat here!!!
The Library Cafe & Bar=After three and a half years working with business owners, planning events, trying to connect people to places worth praising, I've learned a lot. Now this is not to say I know everything there is to know about running a small business, I'd be running one if I did. But I do know a couple of things, and I'm about to reveal a million dollar secret that will take any business from bummer to bustling: PEOPLE FIRSTHuge, right? Now what do I mean by this? If you own a small business, you probably do so for several reasons... but your first should be people. You should want to turn on the lights, unlock the doors, welcome members of the community into your space and exchange something for the money patrons are spending at your establishment. People are your business. It might not be the only reason, but it's why you exist.I've been to The Library a few times now and each time I'm there I don't feel like I'm welcome. I understand the place is tiny, it's typically packed with drunk coeds, it's loud, there's little room to maneuver, all of this I understand. But I also understand that it doesn't take much to make people feel like you value their business and you enjoy them experiencing the things that make you so stellar in a hospitable way. The staff that I've encountered is anything but hospitable. I tell business owners, strive for 5, in other words control everything you can control and work to give people five-star experiences. You can't be 100%, 100% of the time, but a smile goes a long way. A thanks for stopping in, come back and see us again goes even farther. I'm not certain what they're striving for at The Library other than closing time, when they can turn the lights off, lock the doors and not have to deal with people until tomorrow.
Spicy Pickle=I happened to be in the area and was hungry so I used the Android Yelp App to search for Sandwich joints in the area.  Found this one and decided to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did.I ordered the Wise Guys Sub (Capocolla, Mortadella, Hard Salami, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Roasted Red Peppers, Pepperoncini Peppers, Provolone, and Basil Mayo) on Ciabatta Bread $6.99, a bag of Jalapeno Chips $.80, and a Bottle of Water $1.99.The food came out within a few minutes.  The size of the Sandwich was just right....not too big and not too small.  I eagerly took a bite and was impressed with the flavor that the Roasted Red Peppers brought to the Sandwich.  I've had a lot of Italian Sandwiches and have never had one with Roasted Red Peppers.....additionally, the Basil Mayo added another element to the Sub which made it very good.  The proportion of Meat and toppings was very good.The only complaint is that with all of that wet stuff in the Sandwich, the ingredients were sliding off the Bread and it took some work to keep it all together.  I didn't dock them any stars for that....it's more of a preference thing.Of course the Sandwich came with a Spicy Pickle.....which I didn't think was too Spicy at all.....nice flavor though.  Would have enjoyed a really Spicy Pickle.....was hoping for one.Will I return?  I live on the other side of town and rarely come to Egypt....but next time I'm near the area, I'll be back.I made my 2nd trip back to Spicy Pickle. I was sure pleased! This time I tried the "Brooklyn" which had Turkey Pastrami, Swiss, Coleslaw, and Thousand Island dressing on rye. It was a panini. It also came with a side of macaroni salad.The sandwich as very tasty. The Coleslaw was crunchy and fresh. The Thousand Island dressing added a nice touch and they weren't shy on it which I liked since I like extra dressing on anything.The macaroni salad was unlike any other I ever had. It maybe had an Italian dressing on it? I'm not sure but it was fresh and tasty. There were crunchy fresh pieces of celery and onion in it. I had my own drink so the meal cost $7.56. I was yet again very pleased and will for sure be back! I think I will try their flat bread pizza next!
Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant=I'm as familiar with Ethiopian food as humans' understanding of the mechanics of a singularity. With that prologue, I agreed to try out this place with my friend Adam out of sheer curiosity. This is a casual place with inadequate ventilation so you may smell a little when you leave. Adam suggested that we start with something small and if we like it, we'll order more. What a great idea that was! The vegetable combination platter that we ordered, although seemed small, was so filling that we were stuffed after going through a quarter of it. You get four-five items sitting on top of a bread called injera. There were collard greens, stewed lentils and three different types of stewed peas: a mild version (yellow), a medium spicy version (orange) and a super tangy and spicy version (red). The mild peas and collard greens were sooooooo good! I loved them. I'm not into lentils so I skipped that while the red peas were the strangest thing I've ever tried.  It had such a strong kick to its taste, and did I mention how spicy this particular item was?!! Injera, the bread, came in a basket; a bundle of fluffy spongy goodness for you to tear up and dip into the stewed vegetables. I've never had anything quite like it. It was subtle and strange and yet very much agreeable with my palate! I wouldn't mind coming back here again. What an experience that was!A worthy venue to experience the flavors of Ethiopia. Located conveniently near "The Orleans" resort, drive from The Strip to Tropicana Blvd., turn west, just passed "The Orleans" turn in just before Decatur Blvd. This restaurant is nicely decorated and staffed by very friendly people. A full bar is available. The veggie and meat combination (about $27) should feed a group of three or four. It has a large selection of delicacies and plenty of Injera accompanied.  The menu is very self-explanatory with familiar items such as Gored Gored (raw beef), Awazi Tibs (cooked beef), and vegetarian specialties.Worth a $25 cab ride.Save room for Cafe Latte or Spiced Tea afterward.HORN OF AFRICA DINNERHere for dinner with our Ethiopian friends and successful Henderson business owner Mo and his wife Sally who we have known for many years.Following ingredients are commonly utilized in Ethiopian cookery:Injera: made of a whole grain known as Teff and in the United States is made with Teff and wheat flour.... not easy to make at home.Kibe: Ethiopian purified butter which is well seasoned with several condiments and used in traditional sauteing.Berbere: is made up of many tasty spices like ginger, red pepper, cardamon,  cumin and fenugreek.

We have repeated tasting the cuisine in many different parts of America. Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant is equal to the best of the best in Washington DC.UGH! *WHY* did I come here the night before a nude photo shoot?! I knew I wouldn't be able to control myself around this delicious food....and sure enough, I beasted like a little piggie and now I LOOK like a little piggie :-(I don't have much to compare this to -- the only other Ethiopian place I've eaten at is Merkato. The food and service were comparable, but this place has the edge when it comes to ambiance: cozy, cheerfully decorated and homey.A friend and I shared the meat & veggie combo platter for $30 -- something like 10 different scoops of lentils, veggies and meats on a giant piece of injera (spongy sourdough pancake). Plus a basket of injera on the side. Everything was fanTAStic!!!The only downside was, I ate so much injera and it's all puffed up in my belly now. And as mentioned, I have a nude photo shoot in the morning. Thank dog I do all that ab work at the gym...hopefully my abdominal muscles are strong enough to suck it all back in. I will definitely be back here!
Zada Jane's Corner Cafe=I was once an avid supporter of the deliciousness that was being concocted at Zada Janes. But after today I'm sorry I will not be returning. In a laid back atmosphere I am okay with a laid back service style. Today was beyond laid back to the point of lazy and down right nonexistent. The kicker. A friend specifically ordered gluten free pancakes. Having a gluten allergy this seemed to be a no brainer. Half way through the meal the server let's us know that the pancakes are not the gluten free ones and asks. "Do you still want them?" Then proceeds to tell us that someone else can have the rest of her half eaten ones since she wasn't going to finish them. WHAT?! So after a trip to CVS and $20 in medication we will not be returning again. Sorry Zada. This failure can't be recovered from.
Los Cerritos=Los Cerritos serves up the best California Burrito in the area! The burrito itself is HUGE and stuffed with well-cooked and seasoned carne asada, potatoes, grilled onions, melted cheese, and some herbs and seasoning that make this like no other burrito. All this in a freshly made tortilla for only $4.99! When we have a craving for Mexican food, we'll drive past the several other closer restaurants to visit Los Cerritos because the burritos are that good. I wasn't too impressed with the crunchy shredded beef taco, but the rice and beans were good and the lettuce was fresh. Now, I just stick to the burritos because they know how to make a mean burrito! Like Roland W. and Stephen B. mentioned, sure this place doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't judge until you've tasted the food. The staff here are always friendly and take their time preparing the meal (not just thrown together in 30 seconds in a tortilla like they do at the fast food chains). Los Cerritos is a small casual restaurant that serves up some tasty Mexican food!
Maria Maria=I absolutely love the interior of Maria Maria. Upon entry, I'm instantly relaxed, especially when they dim the lights 'round 7:30 p.m. There's a picture hanging near the hostess table that i wish I could snatch off the wall and run away with. I love it! If you see it, it's the picture of a guitar etched upon the back of a female. Lovely!But, what about the grub? Well...First trip here, I sat in the bar area. I ordered their Baked Cheese with chicken, ham and chrizo. It came with warm, thin tortillas. A bit too greasy for me - some would say I should have expected this - but I thought, over all, that it was good. It sat in my belly like a rock, though.My second trip here, my friends and I sat in a "mini lounge" area under one of the huge plasma screens. It was a comfy space that begged to be occupied on an early Friday evening. We each ordered a drink. Sangria for two. Sangria blanco for one. Four Peaks Sunbru for me. Then all 4 of us split the seafood guacamole. Oh yum. If you order anything of the menu, this is a must. The lump jumbo crab meat with shrimp is heavenly. I could have eaten just the warm seafood that comes on top of the guac. In fact, we did ask for just a side of that. Unfortunately, when the check came, we were charged for 2 orders of seafood guac. So, basically we were charged $28 for seafood guac with extra seafood. Go figure. (If I had known, I wouldn't have ordered it on the side.) Three salsas, chips and the seafood guac was hearty enough to satisfy us. For kicks, one friend ordered the plantains. I had a nibble. It was good, though I'm no fan of the creamy white stuff on top. Icky.As for drinks, the Sunbru was just okay. They do have a pretty good drink menu, though. Between beers and wines, I'd be set here any day of the week. They offer 2 different Viogners by the glass! They do have plenty of mixed "specialty" drinks for those who like their hard liquors. If you like coffee, they serve that too. When asked what super strong java they had given me, I was told it was from the brand "Mr. Espresso." And here I thought I may be drinking authentic coffee, for it sure packed a super strong punch!I have to say that while I really, really, really dig the decor and atmosphere, the food has, for two times in a row, made my tummy a little bit upset. I can't put my finger on why it would, but it makes me a little concerned to go back. I think if I do, I'll order the Spinach Mango Salad with Grilled Shrimp, with almonds and raisins. For $13, it better be great! If you're at Tempe Marketplace, check this place out. My friends and I ended up sitting around and chatting for a few hours. Our server was very nice, though towards the end, he got slammed with other patrons and neglected us a bit. It was understandable, since we were basically only there to nosh and drink. *drum roll*Maria Maria gets...4 stars for atmosphere and decor. 4 stars for service.2 stars for food that makes my tummy a tad upset.2 stars for the live music that night. It didn't seem to fit the motif. For a final score of 3 stars, which is a typical "It's worth checking out but don't expect to be blown away" rating. I really wish I could rate this place higher. I want to! But...I just can't.My visit to this place was not only disappointing, but it made me sad to think that this place would probably go the way of Planet Hollywood in a year or two. I had the Carnitas and I had to cut (or should I say SAW) into it with a knife and fork. My friend's crab enchiladas were underwhelming. I was heartbroken that yet another famous Latino is slapping his name on a "brand" that will probably fail instead of actually checking out the food and making sure it's edible. Very beautiful decor, and nice (but not terribly sharp) staff is about the only thing I can say about this one.I wanted to hate this place more than I do, but it's not that bad.   Been here a few times and the food was average to above average.  Drinks were normal, but any specialty drinks or tequilas seemed expensive. The nachos were very good, and different than most places.  I liked the music, and no they don't play much Santana at all.The staff is young and inexperienced, so service is hit or miss.  If I had to hang out at Tempe Marketplace I'd come back here I guess.
J.K. Sushi=I really want to give this place another star but cant as of yet. It is Korean family owned. They are in the process of getting their liqour license so their menu's were a bit confusing. They didnt have the beer pictured on the menu and they were out of or did not have what we really wanted to order from the menu. No fatty tuna etc etc. I suggest either not having those menus out or marking out what is not available. It was a bit confusing. We finally started with the green mussels and crab angels they were ok. Imitation crab eh, the Ikura was good see pics. The kid loves those damn things. The roll we ordered tasted really good but I cant remember the name, it had red snapper on top it came apart easily and their mayonnaise sauce was a little too orange looking compared to what I have seen. The meat eaters seemed to love the dolsot bibimpap with all the little sides. The tuna titaki was different hardly seared at all. I have been here before its a cute little place I love the staff they are super nice. There was tons of people picking up food while we ate. There were also several other diners being served. The best thing about this place is the pictures of all the dishes on the walls I think that is pure genius. The new sign says J.K. Sushi it was also known as The Japanese Bawl not bowl. I agree with Aletheia on this place though, it truly is better than Hana on 7th Ave. http://www.yelp.com/biz/jk-bowl-phoenix I really hope they get their liquor license soon before Ah-So opens up at Norterra.
Aux Vivres=Pretentious, boring, contradictory.  Their menu totes "freshest ingredients, giving priority to local and seasonal produce, to create surprising flavour combinations and unusual dishes that you won't find anywhere else."  This statement is a stretch by any means, I have been to many vegan and vegetarian restaurants, that have blown my mind with unique and innovative cooking. This is not one of them. Tofu and tempeh burgers are a dime a dozen. As are asian fusion bowls but not with the hefty price tag of 13 to 15 dollars, for a veggy bowl. What is local or seasonal about daikon, dulce or wakame? Let's be honest about what this restaurant truly is; it does not cater to much of the vegan crowd, because most vegans wouldn't pay the inflated prices for things they could easily make at home.  Most vegans and vegetarians have had their share of tofu and tempeh burgers, if not a few hundred veggie bowls. Therefore, lets truthfully admit that this restaurant caters to the curiosity of non vegan and vegetarians offering trendy fare at a price. The staff were rather aloof, and had us standing at the host station for 10 minutes, while looking over a virtually empty restaurant. Furthermore when we were seated by who we thought to be our server, she said nothing to us and walked away from the table after seating. She then returned  with a bottle of water (for 3 of us)filling our glasses with water and walked away. 20 min later our glasses were empty and we were still waiting to order. When we finally made eye contact with one of the other employees behind the juice bar(who was leisurely chatting with other staff behind the bar), the original host/server finally came over and begrudgingly  took our order. After our food arrived our water glasses remained empty ( we think that they only allowed us one bottle of water because they expected us to buy drinks, such as $4.50 for 8oz of juice) and no one came to check on us to see if the food or order was to our satisfaction. To top it off the server had forgotten to bring a bowl of soup, but didn't realize.  Then another sever showed up at the table with soup in hand after we had already finished our meal.  After asking him to pack it to go, he returned with the bill and has the audacity to start chatting us up, almost as thought he was hoping to get a good tip. WTF?!The food was satisfactory, but all in all the place left a bad taste in our mouths and a hole in our wallets.Generous portion, reasonable price and fresh ingredients. I had the buddha bowl (with tofu), which came in a large colorful bowl of veggies and rice.My only small complaint is that I wish he proportion of rice to veggies was more equal, as there was way too much rice and not enough veggies to balance it. However, the sauce was very good and complemented the meal well.   The price point was very reasonable. $11 for the sandwiches and $13-15 for the bowls. I wish i had the room to try their desserts as they looked so so good. Will definitely return to try the sandwiches and chocolate desserts !   P.S. Their menu is extremely extensive, so great place for non-vegan/vegetarians as well.
English Rose Tea Room=We went back today to try the Duchess of Bedford's Formal Afternoon Tea....truly sumptuous! It is served on a 3 tier stand ..... the presentation is  really amazing : ) We were lucky to get a seat as there were only about 2 tables left on the front patio. It was great to see it so busy as well as to see everyone enjoying their tea and sandwiches!We had to order the Paris Tea once again as we had been craving it since our last visit. The staff as last time were wonderful and we picked up yet another little item at the gift store.Do you feel like taking an afternoon trip to have high tea with the Queen? What's that you say? You can't find time in your day to hop on a plane to the United Kingdom? Well that's quite all right because I have the next best option right in our own desert backyard. I am talking about the one and the only royal experience at the English Rose Tea Room in none other than Cave Creek Arizona. I will just start by saying that the website and pictures don't do this little afternoon tea house any justice. Think of the English Rose Tea Room like the perfect haven for ladies who lunch. The ambiance is fit for a Queen. It's girly, it's cozy and it's adorable, almost like a magical elf's cottage. The woman who runs this tea room is English herself which makes the experience that much more enjoyable. As you walk in, a quaint outdoor patio greets you and once inside, shelves line the walls with every type of tea and tea accessory imaginable. Oh and let's not forget about the Queen herself welcoming you inside (or a cut-out, but we're playing imagination here). Behind the panels lies an intimate tea room where ladies and their guests lunch or have afternoon tea. Hats? Yes there are plenty of hats all around. Did you forget your hat? Well that's ok because there's a basket full ready to be loaned out for the occasion. Moving on to the tea experience itself, well it's really quite charming. The menu ranges from basic lunch items such as quiche, chicken salad sandwiches and salads to afternoon tea items where you can order the entire Afternoon Tea ($24.99 a person) or you can pick and choose from an a la carte menu. Because my Mom and I had waited so long to try the English Rose Tea Room and we went to celebrate her belated birthday, we ordered a feast fit for a Queen. We first started by sharing the half English salad split for two which was a perfectly fresh salad of greens, raspberries, candied pecans and a delicious raspberry vinaigrette. Following our salad, the Afternoon Tea for two appeared in front of our very eyes! This three-tier meal was accompanied by our choice of tea. We decided to go with the apricot and enjoyed every last sip of not one but two pots! The tea was so delicious you don't need sugar or cream either. The three-tier tea included 6 mini sandwiches a piece (2 cucumber, 2 chicken salad & 2 salmon), two very large (and scrumptious) scones topped w/ powdered sugar and many mini desserts to finish off the meal. My favorite items were the chicken salad tea sandwich, the salmon tea sandwich and the scone. The desserts were decent but the scone really stole the sweet-filled show. This is a truly delightful place to spend a lazy afternoon when you have nothing but time. Don't visit expecting to be in and out for a quick lunch. No, tea is meant to be savored and you can absolutely do that at this perfectly tealightful restaurant.Pick out the girliest, most floral covered dress you own and put  it on. Make sure it's pink. Next, double check that you have pink nail polish, lipstick and blush. Ok you're all set.Do you have a mom? Sister? Wife... Daughter... Aunt... Female caregiver...? Are they in the least bit girly and celebrating a birthday or mothers day or divorce or whatever?  This is where you take them.You sip tea and nibble scones all while surrounded by pictures of the royal family, flowers, dogs, kittens, tea cups and other feminine knick-knacks. And of course, the hats. They have a basket of hats available to borrow for your afternoon tea. Some of them are clearly for little girls and are a little beat up, but there are plenty of nice new ones as well.The tea menu is extensive and will satisfy any taste, available in small pots and large. I had the English Rose and it was delightfully light and aromatic. The food offerings allow for both breakfast or lunch with savory and sweet options. And of course save room for the scones. The scones they serve are the highlight. They are served warm with clotted cream and strawberry jam, like in any good English parlor.After you have had your fill of tea and scones, walk over to their little shop next door. In it you will find jewelry and hats, home decor, soaps and fragrances.Quite the lovely experience, indeed!
Lucky's Pizza=The first time we tried Lucky's was maybe six years ago. I didn't like it then. Hard to remember what we ordered, perhaps a Sicilian style, but either the crust or sauce or something else turned us off and we decided not to go back. Until a couple of weeks ago, when, having exhausted just about every other food place in Surprise two dozens times over, I came up with the jolly idea of getting us some Lucky's again based on all the good reviews. And I hated it just as much this time around as the first. UGH.The only positive thing I can say about this place is that they give you a ~monstrous~ amount of pizza. Imagine a large pizza box precisely filled with a giant square BRICK of a pizza, easily an inch and a half tall and cut into square slices. That's what we got. I'd say it was over 3 pounds of pizza; flavorless and gross. I found it breathtaking that it had that little taste. This was a supreme pizza that tasted through and through like I was eating play-doh. Olives, sauce, cheese, crust, the works. To top it off, the mushrooms were slimy, canned champignons and not fresh at all, and tasted as though they'd just been pulled out of someone's nose. I've had some pretty bad pizza in my time, most of them I'd liken to eating chewy, dry cardboard. This was the first one that was this big and relatively succulent and STILL tasted gross.I stomached maybe six slices over two sorry-ass sittings before throwing about 2/3 of the pizza away. Two pounds' worth of "food", down the sh1tter. I don't know where the mass delusion about this place comes from, but I'll never return. If I want a gutbuster special, especially now that Bronco Billy's is gone, I'll head to Rays just down the road instead. Plus, Lucky's is overpriced. A large and a smaller pizza cost us $30. Most of the smaller pizza was thrown away too - I didn't try any of that one so I'm not reviewing it, but the wife said she was incredibly unimpressed with it, and it was just a plain cheese. If it all tasted good it would have been worth it - I'd have paid that and more for a Chuck Wagon Special from Billy's - but the lack of flavour and value drops my rating of this joint to a bottom-of-the-barrel single star. And just for proverbials and giggles: http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=inspectionResultsDrillDownAA&permit=FD-05766&business=Lucky's%20Pizza&address=15508%20W%20Bell%20Rd%20Suite%20207&insp_id=3182324
Blue Burrito Grille=My "go to" place to grab a bite to eat when I'm in the C-Gates area of McCarran Int'l Airport.  I like to grab a Burrito & a Brewskie while I wait for my plane to depart.  Since I'm one of those guys who likes to get to the airport super early so I don't miss my flight, I have plenty of time to kill.  The FREE WiFi is awesome because I can surf the web while I enjoy my eats from this place.Return Factor - 80%BLAH is really all I can think of.  Blah, Blah, Blah.Everything tasted the same.  Everything!  I got an open chicken burrito which is basically a burrito in a bowl, opened.  It had chicken, rice, cheese, peppers, onions and the shell.  I ate a piece of chicken, tasted like the grill.  I ate some rice, tasted like the **Burnt** grill. I ate an onion, tasted like the grill.  I are a pepper, tasted like the grill.  I ate the cheese, tasted like a burnt grill with cheese on top. YUCK!  I ate about 4 forks full and was so disgusted I had to chuck it.Fail of an airport dinner to the max!
Burger King=This Burger King is in McCarran, after you pass through security. It's my default meal choice when I'm stranded here.It's tradition for me to have a light lunch or dinner here before flying out (I even impulsively got onion rings here once after arriving in Vegas). Yes, this Burger King is reliable, but the sad truth is that airline food sucks a big fat one. Anyone else notice that this Burger King always seems to be expensive, and it's not just the sales tax talking? (It's not quite price gouging, but it comes close for fast food.) Thank goodness they take credit cards.For many, it's easy to succumb to Burger King's greasy goodness - the other businesses in this terminal don't offer much, anyway - TCBY's, I'm looking at you!
SUSHISAMBA Las Vegas=Alright, now were getting to the good stuff. And by "good" I mean un-fucking-believable. Yea, I said it. Unreal. Never have I wanted to pick up and move to Vegas so much in all of my life, but I'm thinking about it after the dinner I had at Sushisamba's new ultra lounge, Sugarcane. This is an incredible statement for me because for one, I can only take Vegas in small doses, and two, I despise the heat. So having said that you can believe me when I say that I love absolutely everything about Sushisamba, the Brazilian/Peruvian/Japanese fusion restaurant at the Palazzo. Where do I begin?Oh yes, Holy Mary Mother of God, I've died and gone to heaven...A friend of mine is the Publicist for this new restaurant, as well as the brand spanking new, Sugarcane. She hooked up a dinner reservation for me and some friends so that we could celebrate my good friend's birthday in style. Upon our (late) arrival we were greeted warmly by the wait staff, as they explained to us that our party would be the very first members of the public to sit down to dinner in their brand new ultra lounge. As we walked through the dimly lit hallway, past the DJ booth and dance floor, and into the dining area portion of Sugarcane we were immediately taken back by the overall design concept of the space. I"m gonna do my best to do it justice but I would highly recommend a trip here to experience for yourself because it is just too complex for words...The walls are covered with graffiti-style murals of Samurais and Japanese script, the dance floor has a canvas like screen that wraps around the circular pods that make up the women's bathrooms (see pics) where they project abstract imagery to coincide with the music playing. The DJ that night was Claudio who I wanted to put in my pocket and take home because the music was just that dope. There are multi-colored glass cylinders that hang from the ceiling and beams of light (see pics) that separate the dance floor from the dining area that change from red to orange to white that create a truly magnificent effect. The food and service is on a level that is even harder to explain - it was incredible. Our waiter Anthony took such good care of us we felt as though we were old friends by the time we left. Of course, we were the first to be seated and the last to leave, so I guess if you spend enough time with your waiter (four hours) you begin to feel like family. Our sake sommelier was a hilariously funny girl (I forgot her name) and very helpful and knowledgeable when describing our sake selections. We ended up choosing a bottle with gold leaf cherry blossoms there were supposedly good luck if you found them floating in your drink. Our table decided to order the signature Sushisamba 7-course Omakase ($70 per person) as our dinner selection. Anthony asked us if we had any food allergies or other special requests before going back to the kitchen to get our party started. Our first course was a selection of appetizers (see pics) which included the Kobe beef carpaccio with wild mushrooms, seared ahi tuna on a tiny bed of spinach, and (my favorite) tiny ceviche fish tacos with a chili foam sauce that was AMAZING! Next up was the best snow crab I have ever tasted, filet mignon, duck, Chilan Sea Bass (unreal), grilled tomatoes, fish jowel (I forget what kind) and the most beautiful sashimi plate I've ever seen/tasted. Just when we thought we couldn't eat any more came the sushi course. A stand out roll was the Kobe beef wrapped roll with (from what I can remember) a spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado center. As we sat back in our booth contemplating exactly how we were planning on walking out of there, Anthony presented the birthday girl with an incredible chocolate fondue plate (see pics) complete with Japanese-style sesame rice krispies, Japanese cake, homemade marshmallows, and a selection of fruit. There were also mini fruit tacos with both mango and banana, with a chocolate mousse and caramel topping. Do you see what I'm talking about?????Here's the rundown....Party of four:First round of cocktails (on the house)Several cocktails to followBottle of premium sake7- course Omakase dinner for four ($70 each)After dinner cocktailsDivine dessert platterTotal bill: Approx $600Not bad I'd say. Not bad at all. All in all, I plan to go back to visit several times over. Anyone who stumbles upon this place should consider themselves lucky to be in the presence of such foodie excellence. This dinner made our entire trip, and made for a very, very happy birthday girl. Sushisamba: the wait staff, the owner, the managers, the DJ. You rock my rock-n-roll world.Sushi Samba has been a hit or miss with yelpers, and here's my chance to check them out!  Featuring a special "Election Day Menu" with specialty cocktails and cheap appetizers, it was a perfect opportunity!Drinks on the menu:* Obamarama (blue) for $11 "Svedka Citron, blue curacao apple liqueur, guava, blueberry" - Really good the first time around. Pleasant to look at and just tasty-good.  The guys and gals enjoyed this drink.  The second time I ordered it, there was way too much alcohol though, and not in a good way.  A good cocktail should be enjoyable to drink; I passed the second one off.* Maverick (red) for $11 "Pearl Vodka, freshly muddled strawberries, orange liqueur, lime, guava" - Served in a martini glass, so a bit more delicate to drink.  Pretty tasty as well. I enjoyed it.Bites to eat:* Shishito Peppers ($2) "grilled spicy peppers, sea salt and lemon" - They give you a bunch of these peppers on a plate, and it was okay for me.  I tried one and found that to be good enough.  Didn't really care for more.* Organic Chicken Aji Amarillo Anticucho ($2) - I found the chicken to be okay, but really enjoyed the Peruvian corn that came with the dish.  That was the best part of it.  Our order had one skewer of chicken, but the party next to us had two? Hmm... * Spicy Crunchy Tuna Roll ($3) - Really good roll!  I liked this a lot and ordered myself another.  I like how they do their spicy sauce here; it's more mayonnaise-based.  And the slight crunch is nice too.* Salmon Avocado Roll ($3) - Pretty simple roll with just salmon and avocado.  But it was fresh fish and good.  I'm sad I didn't order more.* Mini Chicharron de Calamar ($3) "cornmeal crusted calamari with tamarind sauce, tomato salsa & plantain" - Our friend's order came out soggy, so they thought it was gross.  Ours had a better crunch on it, so it tasted better.  It wasn't particularly exceptional, it was okay.  I don't remember any plantain in my dish though.  * Japanese Chicken Wings ($4) "teriyaki and sesame" - It's hard to go wrong with teriyaki chicken wings, right?  Good, but messy.* Chilled Oyster Sampler ($4) "ponzu jelly & tobiko with three oysters" - Really fresh oysters with an interesting ponzu jelly.  We were supposed to get another order before we left, so I missed out on more!  Next time!* Mini Yellowtail Seviche ($4) "ginger garlic and soy" - Reminded me of Hawaiian poke with the dressing.  It was good with the red onions mixed in there, more poke-like than ceviche-like though.* Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos ($4) "shiso, avocado, roasted corn miso and spicy aji panca sauce" â" Two different sauces to put over the taquitos, and it was good.  Very messy though as it broke apart after the first bite and was dripping all over my hands.  Our order came with two taquitos, but when our friend ordered it, he only got one!* Rosca ($9) "homemade doughnuts with hazelnut chocolate dipping sauce" â" Recommended by our bartender/waitress as her favorite dessert.  Four doughnut holes arrived and they were just okay.  Disappointing for us, and we wished we had chosen another dessert instead.We spent the whole time at the bar because there was standing room only at this event.  So, the girl making our drinks also served us.  She was busy but tried her best to make our drinks were full and our orders were in.  (Our drinks were good for the most part except for that second Obamarama we ordered.  But hey, some people like more alcohol in their cocktails!)  I had a bigger problem with the kitchen output and their consistency.  With certain orders coming out, sometimes you got two of something and other times you got one.  Our friend mentioned that we got more sushi in our order than when he ordered it.  (Makes you wonder what happened to the other pieces.)Overall, we had a decent experience at Sushi Samba.  You definitely can't beat the price and the atmosphere is casual, which is nice alternative at a strip hotel.3.5 stars.They also offer a happy hour (Sunday through Thursday from 4 to 7 pm, and then a reverse happy hour from 10 pm to close), available in the bar area only.(Pics posted, of course!)I'm a sushi purist.  Please no fusion crap.  Very few places can pull off fusion and I'm sorry but you're definitely not in the runnings. Serve me my fish off straight from the waters onto my rice.  Thank you sir, now get outta my way you're blocking my view of the fish I'm going to devour.Huge disappointment, pricey, trendy, and mostly empty and how dare you forget my soy sauce again?  Don't you serve sushi? Doesn't it say that in the name of your restaurant? Even after I pointed it out to one of the servers he jokingly said, "yah and we're a sushi joint, you think we'd have soy sauce."Gimme my freakin soy sauce!Sushi Samba was the perfect spot to fill up on tasty food after a quick shopping spree at The Shoppes at The Palazzo with my fashionista girlfriend. We went straight for the $16 Chilean seabass bento box, which was the best deal on the lunch menu. It came with miso soup, field green salad, tuna roll and oshinko pickles. The three skewers of miso glazed seabass, along with all the sides, was a nice amount of food (though could've been a little small for a big appetite), but I seriously could have eaten three more skewers. The seabass was amazing! That miso marinade was to die for. I suppose I could've gotten the entree portion, but for lunch, it was perfect. Plus, $29 is a bit much to spend on a lunch entree. There were six tuna rolls, so that also made the bento filling.The funky decor was really cool, and reminded me a little of Blowfish in the bay area -- but much bigger and with Latin influences intertwined. The staff was awesome, and the food came out quick. We were in and out in a flash, and back to the pool before our guys even missed us.Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian fusion. I'd think that intrigue alone would be enough to bring anyone to Sushi Samba.I'll have to admit that I was nervous when our knowledgeable and friendly server began talking about the three different kitchens, the different ways to order...it all sounded way too complicated. (To be honest, I just wanted to fill my stomach so that I'd be able to drink later!) Luckily, one of our friends is a Sushi Samba master, and he did all of the ordering for our table. I pretty much loved everything - if only for the novelty of it all - but a few stand-out dishes were:1) yellowtail ceviche taquito: they looked like little yellowtail and guacemole tacos. somehow it all worked...2) yellowtail tiradito: kinda like a ceviche? yellowtail, jalepeno, and lemongrass - i'm definitely a fan of sour and spicy.3) fresh oysters and jumbo shrimp: no explanations needed.4) El Topo roll: salmon, jalepeno, melted cheese, and crispy onionsI also would recommend getting a side of Peruvian corn (which went along with our churrasco plate) just to see how HUGE those kernels are! It's kind of ridiculous. Anyway, not only was the food great, but the service was among the best - they even have a "sake sommelier", so to speak. The place itself is energetic, contemporary, and very, very Vegas. I can't wait to go back!We were in Vegas this past weekend and decided to check out Sushi Samba.  We did the tasting "omakase" menu and it was a hit with everyone on the table.  We got a nice sampling of everything there, it was all superb.  My favorite were the yellowtail tacos, yumm!  Most of all, we had a really great waitress, unfortunately i can't remember her name but she was very well informed and on top of it and she's the reason i'm giving this place 5 stars.SushiSambaSushiSamba is an Asian Fusion type of Restaurant.  It takes the combination of Japanese, Brizilian and Peruvian cuisine to create their menu.  After attending a show in the area we had the craving for some Sushi.  We had decided on Sushisamba.When we got there I think we were in between meals (lunch / dinner) so the place was now crowded.  It was kind of good like that, because it wasn't too loud and plenty of tables to select from.  Kind of dark, but yet nice ambiance.  A little music in the background, not too loud which allows you to have a nice comfortable conversation.  Not too dark to the point where you couldn't see what you were eating.  Here is what we decided to order:Rock Shrimp Tempura Golden pea shoot, snap pea jullienne, spicy mayo, black truffle vinaigrette 18.00Tasty...think I like this dish the best.  4 starshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=YfPESP5vVgqKCRts_w9uKQSea Bass and Miso  Sea Bass on a skewerTasty and flavorful, the sauce was on the sweet side.

I even picked out the most popular items (of course, according to Yelp) and took my server's recommendations. However, I expected my taste buds to have a party that night, and it fell a little short.Overall, it was a good dinner. Service was impeccable. From beginning to end, their staff worked perfectly together to make sure we enjoyed our experience. Water were always refilled, our emptied plates were cleared immediately, yet they didn't hover or rush us. Very friendly. We really couldn't have asked for a better wait staff to serve us.What did we order?Crispy Taquitos - Yellowtail & LobsterRib-Eye Robata SkewersMiso Marinated Chilean Sea Bass w/ Purple Sweet Mashed PotatoesPeruvian CornSamba Strip RollBobo Brazil RollRosca - donutsThe best tasting dishes for us was of course the Chilean Sea Bass. It was good enough that we were a bit disappointed that it was such a small serving size. Two small skewers. Peruvian Corn was also a hit. However, the sushi rolls were well presented, but lacked much in flavor. The rib-eye and taquitos were decent, but as I reiterate, all pretty to look at, yet nothing came close to being a wow.Setting is very nice, the restaurant is nice set up to accommodate large parties as well as couples. Bar serves food and offer happy hour drinks till 7pm on weekdays. I definitely appreciated the complimentary birthday dessert, the Coco Duo, which was sweet and yummy. Photos are available of all items I listed here. 3 stars for now, however I'd definitely give Sushi Samba another try. Maybe the wow will come later...While my better half was making moolah at the poker table, I needed to escape the ding-ding-ding sounds of the casino and decided to grab some happy hour. A short walk from the Encore, SushiSamba seemed to fit my need for some discounted booze and appetizers. Their long oval bar by the main entrance was pretty much empty, so I easily settled into a spot and perused their happy hour offerings. They offered three different whiskey cocktail concoctions for $6. Not being a huge whiskey fan, I picked the one that sounded the least rough to me. It was actually pretty decent, although I could have used a little more cocktail and a lot less ice. I picked three appetizers, an amount that is generally plenty at most happy hours to fill me up to the brim. The shrimp & chorizo skewers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA#rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA) were my favorite. The shrimp was barely cooked through with nice char marks and the chorizo had great flavors. The chimichurri-like sauce on top was great. I could have eaten a lot more of these. The sliced ahi tuna (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA#-AMDCTLNjWrfNMkPbPGf0A) consisted of two very thin pieces of ahi drowned  in a soy-mustard sauce and topped with a halved cherry tomato and some leaves. This portion was super tiny and made me wonder whether happy hour at this place meant you get a quarter of the portion for half the price of the regular appetizer dish... I got the same feeling with the shredded pork mini tacos (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=rDJUWVRIOa0MXgtMILQ7HA#i30qdbtwZSj2f8tNbjkqLQ). One bite and those suckers were gone. The spicy sauce on the side served in a shot glass looked cool, but it was so frickin' hot (the bartenders thoroughly warned me) that you could only use a mini droplet on each taco. So what was the point of serving that much sauce? Again, the portion size was disappointing and the taco was just average. Two drinks & three appetizers = $37 (including tip). I left hungry and unimpressed. For around $40 I can usually eat and drink myself into stupidity at happy hour. Sheesh, I could have had a great entree and a nice glass of wine at many of Vegas' amazing restaurants instead. Oh well, SushiSamba is overpriced for its portions and the dishes were nothing mind blowing. Don't think I'll be back here anytime soon.oh yea! love me some SUSHISAMBA! Ive dined here a few times and its always been awesome.I always start out with a watermelon mojito... its amazingly refreshing.My favorite app is the Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos. I don't even know how to describe them apart from saying they re like putting heaven in your mouth.I also always order the Pacific Roll. its  king crab, avocado, Asian pear, soy paper, wasabi-avocado crema. the pear in the roll really brings out the yellowtail and the wasabi is the cherry on top.And also you cant forget to order the Peruvian Corn. Its AMAZING.Whenever we are in Vegas and stay at the Palazzo, The Better Half insists on stopping by this joint so she can get her Sushi on.  On this particular visit, I joined her for lunch and we grubbed.She ordered 4 orders of Unagi (Eel), $4 ea. I ordered some Edamame, $6 and the Seared Wagyu Beef, $18.The Beef was awesome and while it's a small plate, it's very rich and fulfilling.  TBH enjoyed her Unagi....it's her fav.We ate lunch at around 3 pm, which is a great time to do that because it's between the busy lunch and dinner hours, so there's not too many people around.  When it gets busy, it can get crowded.We'll definitely be back.Return Factor - 90%Ever since I came here the first time I went to Vegas, I've been DYING to come back.The food is so good!  I thought we just got lucky the first time we came, but as it turns out, everything we've tried on the menu thus far is DELICIOUS.Ambiance is classy and cool.  It's a nice location within the Palazzo hotel with lots of seats.  Service was also good, as my water glass was always full despite being very busy on a Friday night at midnight.We got:MOQUECA MISTA - shrimp, squid, sea bass, coconut milk, roasted cashew, dende oil, chimichurri rice - $29 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushisamba-las-vegas?select=T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uA#T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uAThis thing is the BEST EVER.  Creamy Thai-style curry taste (hence coconut milk) with the delicate seafood mixed in with bits of crushed cashews, giving the dish great texture.  Rice was served within the sauce mixture as shown; the rice soaked up all the sauce, making every morsel DIVINE.  I thought after a while the dish would get too rich-tasting, but somehow I kept gobbling and gobbling until the plate was empty!EL TOPO SUSHI ROLL - salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion - $15 (forgot to take a pic; too excited about the moqueca mista)Very unique roll with interesting flavors and textures = Delicious!CHICKEN TERIYAKI - Samba Style organic chicken, aji amarillo, purple potato mash, crispy onion - $26 (again forgot to take a pic...)When I saw the huge price tag I thought "WTF?!", especially for a seemingly simple plate as chicken teriyaki (my friend ordered this one so I had no control).  BUTTT I'll have to say that it was probably the best teriyaki chicken I've ever had in my life!  Super juicy fillets of teriyaki chicken, pan fried (I think) to a crisp.  The sauce was perfect; not too saucy, not too dry, and definitely not overpowering to the dish.As with all finer dining restaurants, especially on the Las Vegas Strip, I did think the prices were a little inflated.  Hence the lack of that final star.  However, probably one of my favorite places to eat while in Vegas.  I'll definitely hit it up again on future trips.  They have a good happy hour too (both early evening and late night), so I'll have to take advantage of that next time! :)I'm so glad I made reservations hereI wanted to reserve a place that wasn't Italian or heavy in the Venetian or Palazzo for my group of 8 girls.  We arrived a little early for our reservation and was seated immediately.  My cousin told the waiter what we liked and didn't like.  He said he would create a meal according to what we wanted.  Everything was fantastic.  Below is what we had and its description:Pork Gyozo-  Each dumpling was served on a delicious pumpkin puree.  Delicious!Sushi Platter- We got 5 different types of rolls, 2 of each type.  They were all so good.  Tiger Rock Shrimp- Yum!  If you like honey walnut shrimp then you will definitely like this.  It was perfectly made.  Yellowtail Ceviche tacos- These were the best tacos I have ever had.  The sauce it came with was a yummy spicy foam hot sauce.  They were small but definitely satisfying.  They just melt in your mouth.  So good!  Probably my favorite thing there.  Steak- The Steak was served with collard greens, potatoes, rice, and black beans.  It also came out with 3 different sauces that were all so good.  The green sauce was my favorite.  Seabass on Skewers- This was served with some Peruvian corn.  The seabass just melts in your mouth.  They were perfectly made.  The corn was also really good and went perfectly with the seabass.     Shots- Our shots came out beautifully presented on a shot tier.  Two of us didn't drink so our waiter brought out two that were watermelon juice so we could join in on toasting.    Dessert- Dessert was a mix of the best vanilla ice cream, creme burlee, mixed berries, and banana.  It was nicely made and topped off with some sparklers.  Everything was so tasty and beautifully presented.  The food wasn't just all Japanese.  It was definitely a fusion but everything went together wonderfully.  I think for us 8 girls it was about $75 each.  It was very worth it and we all left stuffed and happy.      Our server took care of us really well.  I liked that he noted there were 8 of us and made the portions perfect for 8 girls.  One of our girls couldn't eat raw fish or anything spicy and he made sure she got her own individual thing.  He also made note that two of us couldn't drink and brought out shots for everyone with 2 virgin drinks.  He made great recommendations and was helpful.  He also took time to take a couple photos for us.  As for the the ambiance, it was beautiful.  We had a great time celebrating.On the Saturday of my bachelorette party, my girlfriends treated me to dinner at Sushi Samba.  It was a fabulous, memorable meal, where we ate well and celebrated in style.We were staying at The Palazzo, and Sushi Samba was the perfect venue for the occasion.  It was convenient to get to in heels, and the atmosphere was festive, edging on clubby without being obnoxious.  We had a big comfortable table, and service was excellent.  I wish we'd gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need, and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise.  (For management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6/29.  You know, your only bachelorette party of the month?)We ordered cocktails, which were pretty good.  I had a Blame it on Rio, a caipirinha variation with cachaça, agave syrup, fresh lime juice, cucumber, and jalapeño.  It was both cool and spicy, and it went down really easy.  The classic caipirinha was also great, with just the cachaça, lime, and sugar.  I also tried some of the Chu-Cumber, a shochu drink with Hendricks gin, elderflower liqueur, and muddled cucumber - very refreshing.  At some point, we got a complimentary cocktail tree, a beautiful iron tree bearing shot-sized wine glasses on every branch.  They held some frothy, sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion.Dinner was delicious.  We had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase, and we decided to keep things simple.  We specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions, and the food just started coming.  It was all served family style, and everything was well portioned for our big group.  We left full but not overstuffed - a plus, since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night.  The cuisine was fun, a creative, unforced fusion of Japanese and Peruvian styles.First, we had a trio of vegetable otsumami, all served together in a lovely green array.  There was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime, and green bean tempura served with a rich black truffle aioli.  My favorite of the three, though, was the handful of shishito peppers.  These were grilled blistering black, polished with sea salt and lemon.  They were pretty irresistible.  Next we got a tray of Japanese A5 wagyu beef gyoza.  These were great, thin-skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince.  They came with kabocha pumpkin purée, a sweet soy drizzle, and a su-shoyu dipping sauce.  The best thing I ate all night, though, was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail, avocado, and roasted corn miso.  The shell was thin and crunchy, and the fresh, tender fish was just right with that avocado, miso, and some thinly sliced vegetables.  The taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant, frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake.After the smaller plates were done, we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi.  I do not remember everything we got, as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi.  The rolls were great, a nice mix of California standards - you know, the mix and match of eel, yellowtail, tuna, etc. with avocado, cucumber, and dots of mayo - and more Samba-specific stuff, with the stray crab leg and lobster claw.  I particularly liked the Samba Strip, with Maine lobster tempura, mango, tomato, chive, soy paper, and a coating of crispy rice.  It was unusual and flavorful, served with a peanut curry.  The rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo.  The sashimi was more traditional, served on a bed of ice.  It was hard to share, as there was only one of each kind, but the slivers I had were great.The most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course.  We got two hefty platters of the Rio Grande with three meats, grilled hanger steak, ribeye, and chorizo.  These were great, juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor.  They came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil, chimichurri, and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu.  We also had some sides of rice, beans, collard greens, and a medley of roasted vegetables - giant corn kernels, toothsome brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, pearl onions, and more.  We also got miso-marinated Chilean sea bass a la carte, with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko.  This was a winner - the fish was moist, flakey, and shot through with miso flavor.We were full by dessert, but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse, served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message.  The lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls, whipped cream, and a little bit of candle-stuck banana.  We each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner.In conclusion, my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend, and for this fun, delicious meal.  Sushi Samba was an A+ choice, worthy of a night I won't soon forget.Good lunch option for Vegas! We started with the Japanese Wagyu Gyoza and all I can say is, wow! This little pockets pack a ton of flavor. I kind of wanted to order another round but I refrained. The yellowtail sashimi tiradito was also wonderful. Thick slices of fish came in a bed of lemongrass and jalapeno sauce. The let down were the rolls. We ordered the green envy and the lima and both were a little weird. I'd say avoid the rolls. The flavors were just off and coming from LA where you can find fantastic rolls at many places, I wouldn't order rolls at Sushi Samba again. The place was packed so service was a bit spotty, but I'd come back again and stick to the tiraditos and gyoza.SUSHISAMBA fuses Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian flavors- peculiar, until you realize that Brazil is home to the largest Japanese population outside of Japan itself.From edamame to plantains, wasabi to chiles, SUSHISAMBA is a true testament to the unique tastes created by immigration and integration and the balanced evolution of these flavors over the last 100 years. Having visited the Las Vegas location several times as well as the Miami one, SUSHISAMBA is high on my list of culinary experiences that delights time after time.Among my favorites is Yamato roll, comprised of tuna, foie gras, osetra caviar, topped with gold leaf. At $19 for 3 pieces, you may have to take a sledgehammer to that piggy bank, but you probably won't regret it.  Another outstanding roll is the Bobo Brazil, filled with avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, and chimichurri inside, layered with tender seared wagyu beef on the outside. Every bite melds into the tongue and disappears in a flurry of flavor.I tried the Kanpanchi Tiradito on this last visit and didn't find it worth the $19. Drizzled in yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil, the 4 small slices of amberjack were acceptable but not exceptional.On a final note, our waitress looked like a gorgeous supermodel, which worked out great in curbing my own appetite, thus making the meal more affordable. I already started a new piggy bank for next time.I didn't realize that patrons can cook at their tables until I sat down!!! Rut roh--not good for my hair!! This is fine if I wasn't going out afterwards...but I got all dressed up and was stressed the whole time about smelling like smoke, bbq, etc.  That put a kink in the experience for me, but I got through it with the help of a few rounds of cocktails:)!  My food was delicious and the service was fantastic!!!  My only complaint was the ventilation and wasting an hour getting ready.  It was good, but I'm thinking twice before going again.Well this is a new fusion- Brazilian- Sushi. Can't say I've tried a newer combo, but from the little Brazilian treats I had here, I'd have to say it works. Located in the Palazzo,  this place has an upscale, trendy vibe. Service, seating and décor were all impressive. On to the food...WHEN YOU GO- reservations are recommended if you plan on stopping by after 6. The place gets uber crowded in the evenings, especially on weekends. Like I said, I didn't get to try as much of the Brazillian side of the menu as I'd like- I'll def concentrate more on that next time. I can speak for the Waygu Taquitos. Could be the best single bite of anything I had in Sushi Samba. Delightfully crisp and light, they were the best taquitos I've ever had. The sushi held it's own but they have a lot of competition in Vegas (see my Yellowtail review). I was impressed with the Lima (shrimp, crab and avo) and the El Topo (salmon, jalapeno and mozerella!). Excellent oyster menu as well. The Kumamto's were delicious, but at $5 ea, not the best deal in town.All in all, I like Sushi Samba and will definitely be a return guest!By far, my favorite sushi restaurant in Vegas! It's Brazilian-Japanese fusion, which is very unique. The quality of everything here is amazing and very fresh. I'm extremely picky when it comes to sushi and this place definitely deserves 5 stars. The service is always impeccable and it is super clean in here. It doesn't have the fishy smell that most bad sushi restaurants have. The pricing is very reasonable for the location (inside the Palazzo and on the strip). The decor of the restaurant is pretty in-tune with the rest of the hotel and other restaurants - hip, modern, and a little funky. They have great cocktail selection and a full bar, as well as a happy hour menu. SERVICE: 5 Stars.I've never had a single complaint about the service here. Every time we come here, the service is always consistent and excellent. We celebrated my friend's 21st birthday here with a group of about 20. After ordering countless rolls, plates of sashimi, cocktails and shots, our server graciously brought the birthday princess the 3 Wise Men shots. Doing stuff like this makes you come back because a year later, my friends and I still recant this story and bring up Sushi Samba.FOOD/DRINK: 5 Stars.Everything is so fresh and good. I usually order Omakase and my favorites seem to be the Yellowtail, Uni, Fresh Ono, and Tuna. The  Tuna Tutaki appetizer is excellent and something I order whenever I come here. For non-sushi eaters, they have plenty of choices. They have a lot of unique cocktails custom to this restaurant that pair well with almost anything on the menu. You will not be disappointed eating here!Sushi samba is located inside palazzo hotel. It's got Japanese, Brazilian & Peruvian food all in one Restuarant. They have the biggest sake menu in Vegas. We saw one on the menu for $4000!!! We ordered the oysters (I wasn't a fan), shishito peppers & edamame for appetizer. I loved the shishito peppers personally.Then we ordered the yellowtail jalapeño, some specialty tuna roll that was crunchy & another specialty roll that had mozzarella cheese in it (sorry can't recall the names) & they were all very very tasty. You should expect to spend about $50-60/person at this Restuarant. Overall, it was good & I recommend it to everyone especially if you are staying at the Palazzo hotel.  The waiter & the hostess were very friendly & nice. Our waiter was originally from Baltimore & he was very nice.
Einstein Bros Bagels=I had a hankerin for a bagel and this location is on my way home from my early morning drive to mesa and back, so I stopped one morning and kept returning. After an unfortunate incident last month though, I won't be coming back to this location.My first couple experiences were fine. Not amazing but I got my order quick enough (sometimes correct, sometimes not) and the location was easy to get in and out. My last visit was just bizarre.I placed my order with the cashier since there were only a couple customers in line and no one was working the order station on the opposite end. One of the employees was fiddling with the screen that shows the orders because it wasn't working correctly. I paid for my sandwich and waited...and waited...and waited...Another patron and I made small talk while watching the one sandwich maker fiddle with the screen some more. The assistant manager was cleaning the coffee equipment. Another employee came out to work the order station and gather bagels for customers who ordered boxes. One guy came from the back to fill the ice machine. Another employee proceeded to eat his food while clocking out for break. The cashier continued to stand around. The other patron and I continued to make small talk.Silly me to think that the girl messing with the equipment will realize that people are waiting for food...I should have spoke up sooner. 13 minutes go by until I say something. "Sorry, we're having issues with the order screen". No shit - how about you start hand writing orders or communicating with the person taking them? Thank you for exhibiting zero problem solving skills.Oh, and the assistant manager? Still cleaning the coffee equipment. No leadership whatsoever.I can put up with incorrect orders, or waiting when it's busy, but I can't put up with lackluster customer service. I'll go out of my way to the 16th st and Camelback location when I have another bagel craving.
Catfish Alley=This place just couldn't be any more consistent, clean or great.  I've come back about six times since my first review.  It's just spotless -- and I really appreciate that.  But it's really about the food.  It's just great.  Seriously, if you're homesick for Southern food -- greens, hushpuppies and zero-grease catfish that doesn't taste muddy, this is it.   I don't know how they do it -- it's just delicious.  Did I mention that the corn fritters rock.  For lunch, this is a great find.  I can't ever clean my plastic plate -- 2 piece special that comes with 2 sides.  I usually get double greens and couldn't be happier.  If I've got a guest with me, I'll splurge and we'll split either the fried green beans or the corn nuggets (they're back).   Never can clean my plate --and that's just fine.  Seriously -- if you're on the east side, this place is just wonderful.I just went here for the 1st time a week ago but I had to go back & get some more of that catfish so I did. Well being highly medicated I ordered a Family 8pc catfish cajun-style  w/hushpuppies and 2 sides(baked beans & fried okra), plus mac n cheese bites. The catfish once again was outstanding, as were the hushpuppies but I was a little disappointed with the rest which is why I've deducted 1 star. Granted it was take out and I didn't get to eat it hot & fresh. The mac N cheese bites were not impressive at all. The okra looked real tasty but didn't make it home crunchy.The beans were just beans,probably canned. I really like this place, the owners run it and its very homey.
Pholicious=Pholicious is a new vietnamese restaurant that just opened in Peoria.  I just love the name of this restaurant: PHO - [pronounced fuh, or fur] is vietnamese beef noodle soup that has existed for more than 90 years + LICIOUS - these days you can add that suffix to just about any base word and you know it is something good. Anyways, got a flyer in the mail for this place and being a fan of vietnamese food decided to give it a go.  We walked in to a restaurant filled with Vietnamese people.  Now this gets me excited because I know it has to be authentic and delicious.  I ordered a cup of crab/asparagus soup - $2.95 for a cup!  And more than a generous amount. Shrimp fried rice - $7.95! Delicious, tasty, cooked to perfection.  The shrimp were not the baby shrimp, but were rather large.  D. ordered the vermicelli w/beef - $6.95!  This was an absolutely delicious dish, extremely flavorful. There are sooooo many things to try on this menu, the selection is huge and the prices cannot be beat.  I know we will be back soon to dine-in or order take-out.When your partner's least favorite kind of food is your most favorite kind of food, you have to pick and choose your battles.For me, this means only suggesting Asian cuisine when Misty S is a) not feeling good, b) not feeling Yardhouse, or c) not paying. All of these scenarios have one thing in common; they rarely ever happen.But alas, as chance would have it, Misty S and I both came down with something over the holidays.Thus, I began my attack."Let's get some pho.""I hate pho.""It'll make you feel better.""No thanks. I don't like pho.""Oh wow, you know what sounds really good right now? A big bowl of soup. Hot, steaming soup. Oh man, Ci Ci's has soup! All the chicken soup you can eat, and pizza too! Snap, chicken soup and jalapeno pizza! We'll be good in no time!""Fine, we'll do Pho."Ironically, when we pulled into Pholicious we saw what may have at one point been a greasy child-infested Ci Ci's, now closed to the world like a tomb. A graveyard of all-you-can-eat-awfulness.Walking inside, I could literally feel the steam off of other people's bowls. It was like a sriracha flavored sauna. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a gentleman drinking coconut juice right out of the fruit itself. And waiters carried around massive bowls of noodles and stuff and other stuff. For a moment I felt that I had found my perfect restaurant.And that's when I panicked.For it is practically written in the cosmos that the more I love an Asian restaurant, the more likely Misty S will find it lacking. See Also: Wong'sSee Also: Dragon Garden ExpressSee Also: Any Chinese Buffet....ever.One of the many joys in dining-in at any Asian restaurant (sushi included) is that I'm not expected to actually pronounce any of the items from the menu. That's why there's all the numbers.Whenever I go for Mexican or Italian the waiter looks at me like I'm a tool if my pronunciation's off and corrects me before having a good laugh at it.Oh, thank you, JEFF, for imparting your SUPERIOR knowledge of the Italian language onto me. Here, before you leave, can you make sure I'm pronouncing this correctly...Vaffunculo e muoia! Now bring the check, I'm going to the Olive Garden.I ordered the #2 (spring roll), and the #40 (egg noodle soup with barbeque pork, prawns, quail egg, and something something).The spring roll was deceptively delicious for a bunch of shrimp, rice, and veggies rolled up in cold rice paper. It came with a nice thick peanut sauce that was topped with peanuts. I love it when there are multiple forms of the same ingredient in a dish. It's so aesthetically pleasing from a deconstructivist standpoint. Blah blah blah, pretentious bullshit, blah blah blah.Before my number 40 came out, Misty's #10 (crab and asparagus soup) was served, and Misty invited me to take part of her soup. It was warm, eggy and soft. Almost with a hint of sweetness, I thought. Light, subtle, and very white. Satie, one of my favorite composers, used to eat "white food" so that he could get into the mood to compose "white music".This is what you learn at art school.My number 40 was awesome. Simply awesome. Spicy, sweet, sour, noodly and meaty. It even came with a side of bean sprouts and chili peppers that I could throw into the soup myself. It was like hot pot but much cheaper and without me screaming at the top of my lungs if someone could please pass me the fucking fish balls. The soup was so good that even after all the noodles and meat were gone I still sat there, sucking down broth by the spoonful. Misty tried several times to coach me on the proper way to hold the porcelain spoon, but alas, I make as proper a lady as I did a boy back in the day. C'est la vie, I guess.After all the sriracha and peppers I had added, the broth was so spicy that my nose was running and my eyes were watering. I looked like I had just been cut from the Rocky Horror cast and yet I still sucked that soup like I've never had it so good. The waiter came by and took away the broth while I was trying to cool off with some ice. I remember thinking "awww man, I wasn't done with that" but aftewards feeling grateful that I was being inadvertantly saved from myself.I feel like I've got a sniffle coming on. Maybe if I wait it out a bit I can do my sad puppy face routine long enough that Misty gives in and takes me back to Pholicious again soon.(After learning I was writing this review, Misty would like to remind me and inform all of you that she doesn't hate ALL Asian food. She's particular to Malay and Indian food, but can't stand all that "panda express" nonsense I gorge myself on. Surprisingly, I don't mind being the tacky and tasteless one in the relationship.)I hate pho. I do. I hate almost all Asian food save Malaysian, Thai and Indian. And those can be pretty interchangeable considering the former is often a hodgepodge of the latter. I find pho boring, and only eat it when I'm sick. You know this. You read Jetta R's review already.So what's with the 5 stars, right?I'm a skeptic to the extreme. We ordered Thai iced tea and I was very, very dissapointed (and a wee bit smug) that theirs comes right out of the can. That was all it took for me to cross my arms and begin the nay-saying. We're waiting for her General Tsao Chicken, and my Orange Chicken lunch special. Poor Jetta's puppy-dog-facing me over the table, trying to placate my snide and pessimistic predictions about the food we'd yet to be served. "Watch. It's going just to be plain chicken breasts with orange slices on top."And then it came, and I shut my mouth. It was so...pretty. Fried rice shaped into a perfect little mound. Crispy chicken glistening in sweet-but-not-too-sweet-even-if-you're-super-picky-like-me sauce. And the taste. OMG. I'm a believer in Chinese food again. Chinese food from a Vietnamese restaurant. And sprinkled throughout - why yes, tiny little mandarin orange slices, cut into quarters. What the hell, Pholicious? Are you trying to kill me with perfection? I've got a reputation to keep. Maybe it was a fluke. Maybe I could still hate this place. Jetta and I returned today, me with chopsticks in hand and ready for a show down. It's on now, bitches. Kung Pao Chicken. Bring it. And they did, while smiling and telling my bestie she looked pretty today. Damn, they're sneaky!And the chicken? ...perfect. Again. Jetta's pho? Also perfect. And I HATE pho.You win this time, Pholicious. I admit defeat. Take your 5 stars while I sulk off into the sunset. Can we rematch tomorrow?A solid Vietnamese joint. Period.

Digestif=I should have known that an Italian restaurant with a French name would be bad news.  Its just the start of the identity crisis going on.....I don't really get what they're trying to do here.  Are they aiming to be an upscale restaurant?  Because the servers in t-shirts and the stripper poles placed throughout the dining room don't really lend themselves to that.  (And yes, I said stripper poles..... metal poles placed in between two leather arm chairs....)  The menu suggests they are trying to go in the direction of casual upscale but the quality of food and service doesn't support that.  I asked our server for a suggestion for a light, dry, non mineral-y white wine.  I got a very oakey, buttery, heavy white.  Totally what I asked for, thanks.  Overall the wine list was unimpressive, however, I did like the fact that you can order a quartino.  I was underwhelmed by the service; our server would disappear for long stretches of time and served me the salad my friend ordered in addition to serving the wrong beers to the wrong people. He also seemed to be lacking knowledge on the food that we ordered, telling my husband that the soup had pancetta flavor, when it actually had pancetta in it.  Other members of my party had their flatware replaced after using their knife for bread and butter while I did not.  It was spotty service all around.  The quality of the food did not make up for the poor service.  Two people in our party ordered the scallops, a Bostonian and a New Orleanian who are used to great scallops.  We both agreed they were pretty awful - very much overcooked; very chewy.  Scallops should not be chewy, you should not have to work at eating them, they should just melt in your mouth.  Not to mention one of the scallops was a bit sandy and obviously had not been properly cleaned.  I know, I know, stupid me, I shouldn't order seafood in the desert.  Especially after eating amazing seafood for a week in NY.  The glace that they were served in had an extremely strong black licorice flavor.  I am not a fan of black licorice, in fact I know nobody that is.  The vegetables that accompanied the scallops were limp.  The aforementioned soup that my husband ordered did not have quite the right consistency due to the presence of the extremely hard pancetta which detracted from the texture of the beans.  His salad was ok; it did come with huge flakes of toasted garlic which fooled him as he thought they were almond flakes.  When asked if we would like dessert one my friends threw down an emphatic "No, just the check!" because the whole experience was just sub par and no dessert nor digestif could possibly save it.Just as a side note....I know that I'm a short girl but I hate it when I go to restaurants and sit on benches and my feet don't touch the ground.  It makes me feel stupid.  The food, the service, the atmosphere....whatever it is that they are aiming for just isn't working.I'm basing this review of my visit on a first impression. Sometimes a first impression is all it takes. I met my friend Heather C for lunch at Digestif. We walked in and were greeted by a friendly hostess. Our server was at our table as soon as we were seated. He overheard me admiring their absinthe fountains and he ran to get me information on where to buy one just like theirs. I thought it was very nice of him. He then ran through their specials of the day. I nearly fainted when he stated that they had a foie gras burger topped with arugula to offer for lunch. I am A LOVER of foie gras. I immediately ordered it but asked for no arugula. The waiter stated that the chef offers baby spinach instead. Perfect. After a bit of wait, our food was served. Ah... what can I say my fellow foodies? The food was beautiful! I had to take several pictures of it for my food porn collection (see pic). I did away with the bun and ate the meat and the french fries. It was fabulous. The burger was a ground up flat iron steak and the foie gras was served on top of it with the baby spinach finishing off the creation. Fantastic, well cooked, and full of flavor. If this is any indication of the quality of the food at Digestif, I will certainly become a devoted fan. It will be interesting to see if my next visit will be just as good if not better...we shall see!
Eddie's House=Had dinner tonight at Eddie Matney's new restaurant, Eddie's House with some friends.  Eddie's opened yesterday In Scottsdale at Marshall Way and Indian School. What a great experience.The restaurant is very comfortable, the art work and decor are fun, the service was superb, the food is outstanding and it is priced reasonably. Meets all my criteria for a good restaurant. You never would have known that this was only their second day in business.We had fish, meatloaf and barbecue chicken (a little spicy). The portions were generous and everyone enjoyed their meals.There is a reason that Eddie calls this Eddie's House. You feel like you are sitting in his dining room. Eddie came around a few times to check in on us to see how everything was. As we were finishing up, he pulled up a chair and talked with us for a while. Great customer service. We will definitely go back.I really really enjoyed Eddie's House.  It was cool, relaxed and high end all at the same time.  We were late for our reservation and it wasn't a problem (thank goodness).  The staff is spot on and friendly.  The chairs-- oh the chairs are so comfortable and you start off with fresh bread and butter with a pesto dipping sauce.  mmmmmmmm.The entrees were delicious as well.  I had the steak salad and it was divine.  Other diners in our party had, the Cobb Salad, the lettuce wedge with bacon and dressing and the burger with waffle fries.  Eddie himself came out to help my friend cut her burger.  He cut it in fours for her and he said that's how he cuts it for his kids.  It was cute.We didn't have dessert but we drank so to me, that is dessert and appetizer and main course sometimes. Our server was really friendly and happy to answer any of our questions.  I am looking forward to our next night out at Eddie's House!Chef Eddie Matney is doing something right at "Eddie's House."I'm not sure why it took me so long to go visit him, but now that I've been, I for sure will be hanging out there again soon.  We really did feel like we were hanging out with Eddie in his living room.  We sat at the bar where Valerie was the bartender / server and gave us honest answers to all of our questions about the menu. We also made friends with Victor and Bob - the other guys sitting at the bar while we dined.  Jared even went so far as eating one of Victor's "sweet chicken lollipop drumsticks" and half of Bob's "chocolate chip cookie tiramisu."  In addition, we did order our own food...We shared two appetizers (great deal during happy hour - all half off as well as half price glasses of wine)...  Scallop carpaccio and "Jacob and Gabriella's favorite edamame."  (Jacob and Gabriella are Eddie's kids by the way).From there, Jared had one of their specials - short rib and prawns.  The prawns (of which I stole one to taste) were crazy big, cooked just right, and very tasty.  I went with a half order (love that they allow you to do that) of the sea bass which comes with broccolini.  It was the perfect size... and delicious.  The sea bass melted in my mouth!  I didn't even share a bite with Jared 'cause I loved it so much!  Of course, we just had to get dessert as well... and despite Valerie suggesting otherwise, we chose the apple pear cobbler a la mode.  It was good but a bit doughy.  We'll have to stick with the tiramisu or try the orange cheesecake instead next time.Chef Eddie himself came out of the kitchen and socialized with us several times during our meal - i love when a chef is personable like that.  We noticed he was doing the same with other guests as well.  The rest of the staff was extremely attentive and friendly to boot.Oh, and a few more things to note about Eddie's House: the decor is warm and welcoming, very comfortable bar stools, a flatscreen TV at the bar, an outdoor patio, cool ass fly fishing photos in the men's room (according to Jared), and take out is available... I saw one guy take-out for his entire family while we sat there!We can't wait to go visit Eddie again - hopefully sooner rather than later!Stopped by for happy hour in early May.  Sat at the bar, which was still empty as it was only 4:30p.  After inquiring about menu items and possible allergens, I settled on the beef kabobs ($8 during happy hour), and the table bread basket (white and flatbread), which both contained allergens- I only had the nerve to try the white, which was good with the pesto butter.  The four 3-inch skewers consisted of tiny chunks of seasoned beef, tri-colored bell peppers, and onions with a chipotle sauce and mayo.  These were tasty, but not worth $8, or the long wait (One: they're kabobs, which usually do not take long to cook!  Two: they're MINI kabobs!)I'll give EH another try.  Sometime, but not soon."Share the passion." This should be every chef's motto, and modus operandi.Passion is truly experienced here, via the tastebuds.The moment you meet Chef Eddie Matney, he makes an impression.  He treats you as family, not as clientele.  He has life just bubbling out of him.  He jokes, he teases, and you get this overwhelming urge to take him by the hand and say,'tell me everything you know." I wonder if he would start by teaching me how to cut a tomato without getting the guts all over the chopping board...The food at Eddie's House is just like his personality.  Dynamic, fun, eccentric, and innovative.  Before coming to Phoenix to open numerous restaurants in the Valley, he created culinary delights in Massachussetts.  This influences a lot of the menu items.  You can experience surf and turf east coast style, or a blending of traditional american dishes with flavors from around the globe.  This is why his style of cooking is referred to as the "melting pot" style.Currently, Eddie's is serving an incredible deal: Maine Lobster Dinner with sweet corn on the cob and buttered potatoes, for $20.  Ongoing deals are the ability to order nearly all entrees in "half orders." want to try the seabass and the seared diver scallops? you can!  for half the price of the regular sized entree.  Happy Hour is a fantastic deal, as well!   Come here between 4-8p Friday and Saturday, or all night Mondays-Thurdays -  and all the appetizers are 1/2 off, as well as many great cocktails for $5, in addition to beer and wine specials.I can easily eat two baskets of bread, with the incredible pesto and gorgonzola butter that comes with it.Best Appetizers:jacob and gabriella matney's favorite edamameToasted Horseradish-Mashed-Potato Stuffed ShrimpTuna Tartar Nachos, Arizona corn & cilantro Best Entrees:Chermoula Roasted Chilean Sea Bass, candied lemon broccolini (i had an orgy in my mouth)East-Meets-West Sesame Tuna & Parmesan Halibut, bok choy, asparagus risotto  (i have never had halibut this beautiful)The Famous, One-and-Only, "What's-In-This?" SteakAside from my love for the sea bass and halibut, I will return time and again for the superior quality, fresh and inventive ingredients, and a comfortable and vibrant atmosphereIf Eddie's House ever rents a room, I'm moving in!  4.5 stars, but I think I'm too stingy with that 5th star sometimes.  Fear of commitment maybe?  I had dinner here with Dottsy Z before the infamous night at Brackin's, right there is a good start to a 5-star evening.  We sat at the bar and started with a glass of wine.  Nice wine list.  By that I mean not too overwhelming for a novice.  I'm no wine expert.  If I can get it down easier than a shot of Everclear, that's good enough for me.As appetizers are half off in the bar during happy hour, we went with three.  I was hesitant with the tuna tartar nachos.  If it walked, flew, or swam prior to being on my plate, I want it cooked.  But, I was pleasantly surprised. The tuna was seasoned so well, I enjoyed it.  The toasted seafood wontons are a take on the crab cheese puffs at most Chinese restaurants, but oh so much better.  I could have eaten a dozen of these bad boys.  Too bad there were only 4 and Dottsy actually expected to partake as well.  The horseradish mashed potato stuffed shrimp rounded out our trio.  I can't say I had ever had a shrimp stuffed with mashed potato, and I'm sad about that.  The shrimp were large, plenty of room for stuffin', and it was quite a tasty dish.  I believe you get 4 shrimp as well.Hold on, we're not done eating.  We also ordered two half dinners.  First, the famous "What's-In-This" Steak.  Here's a hint:  steak.  This is Eddie's version of a shepherd's pie.  The mashed potatoes were well-seasoned and the steak was exceptionally tender.  Finally, we tried the seared diver scallops with apricot goat cheese risotto, my favorite of the evening.  Scallops were cooked perfectly, and the risotto was spectacular.As far as the appetizers, they really only serve 2, or 1 if you're me.  So sit in the bar if you'll order several as they are a little expensive.  And be careful of the half dinners.  While the steak would be enough for me, a half order of scallops was only 2 scallops.  So unless you just want a taste, go with the full meal or try two different entrees!This little gem is in my neighborhood, and I'm kicking myself I hadn't visited sooner, but I look forward to going back!Time to break out the five star rating!Eddie's House does not disappoint, and in fact sets the standard in my book.  I truly wish that every dining experience could be as pleasant, comfortable, and tasty as our visit to Eddie's House. The bar is spot on, with well mixed drinks.  Appetizers were outstanding!  We tried a BLT type pizza which sounds crazy, but was incredible.I had to get my favorite meatloaf on the world.  It just is too good for words.  I do not have the words for this place!!Deserts also rocked.  Yes, we really did it up this visit.  Thanks Eddie Matney for a wonderful time!!!  We will be back!Just had dinner service for the first time.  Excellent service.  Excellent food.  We tried the grilled lamb chops with cumin hummus for an appetizer.  I usually won't eat lamb, but did take a taste, and damn those were good.  It's too bad for me those little lambs are so adorable before they're slaughtered.  Also tried the tiramisu for dessert.  Ladyfingers are replaced by cookie dough!  I think I'm in love with Eddie.  SHHH.Gabi took Stephanie I. and I here on our first night in Phoenix. Eddie's was participating in Yelp Eats, so she wanted to give us a taste of one of Scottdale's best restaurants.We each started with a glass of wine - which by the way, they have an excellent selection to choose from! Then I stared at the menu for about ten minutes deciding...it all looked SO good. I rarely say that. Most of the time, my eyes find something - one thing - that really pops out at me. Not on Eddie's...it ALL popped out at me!After much deliberation (Gabi and Stephanie kept staring at me like I was crazy for taking so long) and a last-minute switcheroo, I ordered the half order of cilantro & ginger crusted ahi tuna with wasabi, mashed potatoes and mango soy bean ponzu. I knew I'd be happy.And happy I was! The ahi tuna was seared perfectly, and the colors were so vibrant on my plate. It was almost too pretty to eat, seriously. And then it was like heaven on my tastebuds. I was already halfway full from munching on the bread basket that came before the meal, or I would have requested the other half of my meal.After we finished and I didn't possibly think I could stuff down anything else, of course came the dessert menu. How could I refuse after a meal like that? We decided on the tiramisu. I was half-excited, because I'm not usually a tiramisu fan. Eddie just changed my mind about that...as long as there's cookie dough and chocolate involved, I'm in. I had a hard time setting down my fork!I can't say enough great things about Eddie's (as you can tell, obviously). Even the service was top-notch!And the added bonus? Eddie himself came by our table and chatted with us. After just a few minutes, it felt like I'd known him for 10 years and he was throwing us a personal dinner party. It was win-win for everyone!I made a reservation for 6:30pm and we arrived just before that. We were told that our table was not ready yet, but it would only be 3 minutes before we were seated because we were next. We went to the bar to have a glass of wine as we waited.  During this time the hostess sat 2 other parties of 4 in front of us. Each time I asked about our table and she would say 'oh, yes, you are next but your table isn't ready'. Finally, at 7:20pm, we were seated at our table. We were told, by the hostess, the delay was because of the lobster special. I find that strange because the couple at table next to us said that you had to order the lobster in advance with your reservation so I doubt that was the actual cause. My wife ordered the Famous Steak. I get concerned any time a restaurant butterflies a filet, but it sounded good. My wife asked that it be prepared medium rare and was very specific because after the steak is cooked it is covered in mashed potatoes and baked again. Unfortunately, the steak came out medium well. We sent it back and did get another one cooked properly. However, by the time the replacement steak came out we were almost done eating. I ordered the meatloaf based on our servers recommendation. I thought it was just average and really did not care for the crispy (aka burnt) edges. The other couple we were with ordered the East meets West (surprising small portion) and the burger. There was no ketchup on the plate with the burger and by the time some arrived at the table the burger had gotten cold. Drinks from the bar were slow as well. It took over 10 minutes for a vodka on the rocks to arrive. Our server was fantastic and we did feel bad making our concerns known because we knew that she would be held responsible even though the wait and over cooked food was not her fault. Eddie's wife stopped by the table and we politely told her about our dining experience.  We were not looking for any type of handout, we just wanted her to know what was going on in her restaurant.  She was very nice and sent over a round of desserts and invited us to call her before our next trip back. Overall the food did not live up to what we were expecting. Maybe we caught them on a bad night. We might go back to try it again, but not if we would have to wait 40 minutes after our reservation time for a table.Three words: bacon infused meatloaf. I could end my review right now and that would be all you'd need to know to make your decision. I am shocked this place has a 3.5 star average because my experience here was nothing short of 5 stars. The atmosphere here is casual but classy and it's the perfect location for a date night or a night out with family or friends. The open kitchen allows the guest to see the chef create the masterpiece and the staff is extremely friendly every step of the way. But the food is really what makes this place a 5 star in my book. I don't often eat meatloaf, but when I do, I want it to be sublime. This was more then sublime, it was heaven with every bite! I don't know how they infused bacon into the meatloaf, but there was a delicious taste of bacon with every single bite. I also liked the fact that I could order a half order and trust me, the half order is still extremely large! The burger here is also spectacular, as well as the Mo' Rockin Shrimp with chili-beer dipping sauce, dough balls. This restaurant is a hidden gem and one I wish I made my way to more often. PS - for all you locals out there, the vibe of Cookin' Jacks still lingers and in a good way. It brings back memories!
Blue Martini=Sooo Many FREAKIN LOCALS. I like the ambiance. The food I haven't tried. The drinks are....well drinks. The dfrink menu has a good selection from the actual blue martini, cookies and cream martini, ets...I think overall as a bar they do well. They bring in a dj at night and turn the place into an all out club till 4am. It seems like the djs know how to get jiggy with it and they're all about opp. Eh I guess I really wanted it to be a place to chill at.You get a combination of different people who come here. Sure tourists.....But mostly locals. Lots of Cougars, velociraptors. Industry people, and socialites. Its weird to see them all in one place. The thing I don't like is the trek to the bathroom - it's like if you had to pee or throw up and you were in the outside patio, you're screwed. ESPECIALLY for Number 2! They have security guards and vip hosts, so ya it's kinda clubby. It does hold over 1100 people. So definitely good times. If you're a guy and you can't get laid here then stay home with your credit card handy and a new subscription to adult friendfiners. But be careful. This is a locals place and a lot of people know a lot of people....But ladies it is a smorgasboard of dudes who are too cool for school and vip hosts, and clubbers, and douchers. Ya have fun with that. I should have just not missed the movie.A locals' place off the strip, but close enough!With their happy hours from 4 pm to 8 pm everyday, it's definitely worth checking out the Blue Martini!  We arrived shortly after 6 pm on a weekday and grabbed a coveted table outside on the patio.  All their specialty martinis and wines are half-priced, as well as everything on the menu!  (Desserts included!)  What a steal!The BF ordered the Down & Dirty (Ketel One Vodka and Olive Juice served with Three Large Olives) and I had the Bellini (Ketel One Vodka, Peach Schnapps, House Champagne, and a splash of Orange juice).  They bring the shaker to you and pour it tableside, which I think is great.  Not only does the waitress not have to worry about balancing the delicate martini glass, but you don't have to worry about trying to drink from a very full glass.  They average about to $7-$8 each during HH.We started off with the St. Louis Style Spinach & Artichoke Dip (Spinach & Artichokes Mixed with a St. Louis Provel Cheese Sauce, Topped with Parmesan and Served Hot with Toasted Pita Triangles).  Like Mr N. mentioned, the pita chips are rock hard.  I'm not sure if they are intentionally supposed to be this hard, but they could soften them up a bit!  A pretty decent order for the price you're paying and pretty good too.I had the Chicken Quattro Formaggi (8oz. Lightly Breaded Seasoned Chicken Breast Stuffed with Four Cheeses (Asiago, Parmesan, Mozzarella, & Provolone) served with Seasoned Rice, Marinated Artichoke Hearts Accompanied by a Roasted Red Pepper Sauce), which is odd since I don't usually like to order chicken breast.  I think the whole 'stuffed with four cheeses' got my attention and that's what sold me.  I had to ask for more sauce so the chicken had more flavor.  The accompanying artichoke hearts and greens lightened up the meal.  The BF enjoyed my dish.The BF scored a winner with the Miniature Martini Lamb Chops (8oz. of Mint Marinated Rack of Lamb served with Seasoned Rice).  They were so moist and tasty, not gamey at all!  We had to ask for more of the green sauce because it tasted so good!  I wish I ordered this instead!  We'd definitely go back for this dish alone!It's pretty chill hanging out there in the evenings.  It gets super packed though, so good luck trying to score a table if you come with a large party.  You can always grab seating inside, but it's pretty dark in there in my opinion.  And yes, there are a lot of fake tans, pretty boys in their shades and 'roids.  An amusing place to people watch if anything.I have to agree with Myke R. about the restrooms being way too far.  Coming from the patio, it's a trek to meander yourself around the tables and crowds just to pee and wash up.  (I did see Allison J. though on my way to the loo!)Overall, Blue Martini is a pretty cool place to hang out during happy hour.  I don't think I'd want to fight the crowds though during weekends and nights since this place fills up.  They do check ID, so no kiddies in here at all.  Update! 05/31/08 - Went back for HH on a Friday night and this place is PACKED!  * Seared Tuna (Sushi grade ahi tuna resting on a nest of asian seaweed and calamari salad, served with asian sesame dressing and wasabi.)  I'm not a big fan of seared tuna, but the seaweed, ginger, and calamari combo definitely added a nice contrast.* Bruschetta (Fresh Diced Roma Tomatoes Marinated with Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Garlic and Basil Served on Toasted Sliced Bread Rounds Topped with Parmigiano Reggiano Cheese)  Nothing special, pretty basic that anyone could make at home.I also tried a couple of their flatbreads.  By the time I got to it, It had been sitting out for awhile, so they were not hot as they should be.  Probably tastes a lot better when you eat them right away.* Mango Madness (Finlandia Mango Vodka, Mango Schnapps, a splash of Pineapple juice) So so good!  A bunch of people from our group was drinking this and we all loved it!  A definite fave of the house, even for guys! (You can find pics of our happy hour experience in the business profile.)Ok...Are you seriously charging covers at the door? So I pull up with my roommate at BM to just have a quick drink - see one of the manager friends. Then the guy at the door says,"The line's not that long, you should stand in line."  Uhm my roommie works at Yardhouse. If she had her uniform on then she would walk right in. Then every week we send a photographer every Wednesday to take pictures for spyonvegas which costs us money. Now all the owners of my company are friends with the owners of BM. Even when I showed them my business card, he was a douchebag. Well There's lots of people in the industry that come here and we can't honor everyone. WTF? Because of this. I officially DOUCHEBAG Blue Martini to Bowel Movement.Viva Las Vagueness!Man, they ruined that song by turning it into a Viagra commercial. Can I get a witness? I mean, seriously. I hear that song and I start seeing blue, which brings me to my review of Blue Martini. Here's how it breaks out, and let's start with the good:1. Hot patrons (for me, the women).2. Hot waitresses (yes, they're female as well)3. Large and roomy venue.4. Indoor AND outdoor space.5. Waitresses=hot.6. Did i mention there were a large number of attractive women of the female persuasion there?7. The place was mostly populated by locals, which gets you away from the rotund, behemouth, gargantuan, midwestern, muumuu-clad tourists that seem to permeate the Las Vagueness vicinity.8. See numbers 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 above.9. They have a happy hour that offsets #2 under the "not as good" section below. Unfortunately, we weren't at it.  Bah.10. They're open LATE, i.e., like 4:00am.The not as good:1. My "Blue Martini" was blue, but it wasn't a martini. It was also overly sweet.  They have other "martinis" that I didn't try, but perhaps those are better. 2. $12 martinis feels like NYC, price-wise, and let's be serious; this is Vegas, not NY.3. $6 domestic beers.3a. $8 foreign beers.4. The lovely waitresses lost one of my party's credit card.  That kind of put a damper on the evening temporarily.5. Service was a little uneven, but we got hugs from the waitress, so uh, let's just leave it at that.6. At a venue filled with hot chiquitaz, they managed to seat us next to a table full of gay men, which would have been ok, except one of them was rubbing his ass up against me after having hit on me.  I could have lived without that, mos' def.7. It's a little ways out of town, and as any of you who have been to Vegas recently knows, cab rides are freakin' astronomical. Don't be surprised when it costs some bucks to get there, but hell, you're in Vegas where ponying up is part of the reason you go, am I right?Overall, this is a fun joint. The band was playing bad cover tunes, but hey, it's Vegas, you can forgive them. It was more than made up for by the quality of the eye candy therein, etc, and what have you. In between band sets they played some cool 80's tunes, which seemed to work nicely.If you're in Las Vagueness, hit up Blue Martini. I'll be sure to go there again next time I'm in town.Good happy hour.  Definitely the best and maybe only time to go.  This place has to have the LV Yelp record for most reviews with the word DOUCHE in it.  Hilarious!!You do get quite the bang for your buck with the $7 martinis at happy hour.  It's almost like 2 for one since the shaker still has a lot of drink left.My friend took me out to this place on Wednesday night. It's very loungey, and SUPER casual. Wednesdays are I guess girls night out, so all the drinks are 50% off. Can't complain! Not to mention, my friend is a bartender at the Hard Rock Hotel, so we got 30% off on top of that! 3 drinks= $20. Down. Overall, the drinks were alright I'm not a martini type gal, but it got me through the night. In other words..it got me drunk lol.4 drinks, and I was on a good level. The live music was awesome! The band was great, and they were playing all the current hits, and all the old school hits..I loved it!The crowd was very mixed. A mixture between old men and young gals.... :x Overall, it's an alright place. Probably not a place I would take my friends to though.Oh yeah, and I got a drink spilled allll over me here. Cool beans.. -_-Uhh....so THIS is supposed to be one of the hot spots for locals??? =/ It was a fun night for me because I had good company with me. But besides that....it was boring! We arrived around 11:45p on a Friday night and it wasn't busy at all. -Weird mixed crowd. Don't expect XS/Marquee/Tao here. I saw a few girls wearing flip flops. The men looked like it was past their bedtime and they should just go home. Do they even enforce the dress code here??? WTF?! =/ -Funky music. It went from Ludacris one minute to Mr C The Slide Man-Cha Cha Time. Once again...WTF?! What a mood killer.-Small dance floor. IF you even call it a dance floor. I would say more like a "dance space." But like I said, it was a sloooowwww night so my crew and I seemed like we had the space to ourselves.Would I be back here again? Eh...definitely not my first or last choice in nightlife.What a train wreck!!!We received a comped table and comped bottle for Thursday night. When the she came with the bottle she said it was an "automatic $40 service charge". I didn't mind paying for it, just wanted a bill for everything I was paying for. She told me that they don't ever give bills for comped tables. I refused to pay. She said she would get me a bill. She comes back almost an hour later with a REPRINTED receipt from a different group. Scammed for a tip once. Left our table and went to get a hookah at the outside hookah area and the scams just continued. Our coal burnt out after 15 minutes and I asked for another coal or if she could adjust it. She said that it would be 1 coal per hookah all night. I looked at her and said we both know that's ridiculous. She then said "if you tip me, I'll fix it". Ended up tipping her $10 and had to continually ask her for refills and for her to fix the coal. Scammed for a tip twice. My sister went to the car to go her sweater because it was cold. Didn't want to stay inside and partake in the Latin Night so we were outside. Not once did the bouncer tell us that he wasn't allowing re-entry as we waited for her by the door. Not once did he tell her that he wasn't allowing re-entry as he flirted with her when she was leaving to the car. But right as she came back he said "no re-entry. You can tip me and I'll let you back in but $5 isn't gonna cut it!" Wow. This was definitely a sign for us to leave. Blue Martini must be doing really poorly for every single employee to have to scam people for tips all night long.Will I be back?Normally I would stay away from places like this... there's too much Affliction clothing and faux hawks for my taste, I found myself here after we arrived to the Gumball 3000, only to find out it had been cancelled. Blue Martini, has a weird mix of youngish people and people who are on the cusp of being the, "old person at the bar". Walking-in we sat down and were promptly greeted by our server who took our drink order and offered a food menu. We didn't order food, only drinks during our stay. The drinks came quickly and were decently strong. Nothing really mind blowing, but what did semi-explode my mind was the size of this place. We sat on the outdoor patio, which by the way is huge and wraps around the entire restaurant. There's also a separate bar for the patio, which is probably why our drinks came out so quick. There's also two other bar stations inside the venue; as well as a dance floor, dining room area towards the back, and what seemed like private room for party rentals. There was a little bit of sticker shock when the bill the came, but we did enjoy multiple shots, cocktails, and Hookah. Did I have fun? Yes. Would I recommend it?, yes, but only to a certain crowd of friends.Despite being a fan of Ian Fleming's fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond, I've never had a martini until I came here on Sat 10/10th when it was still blue skies and sunny outside, and left happily after dark!We sat outside at a cozy table for 2 on their giant patio, overlooking Town Square below, from a blue skied sunny afternoon until dark. The service was excellent! I tried the Orange Creamsicle Martini which tasted like a delicious alcohol infused ice cream bar.  The Dirty Martini was a must try! Both drinks were very good; although I loved chewing on the large green olives best :-)The upscale atmosphere was classy and fun to be a part of. I could see myself wanting to come here again, despite so many other wonderful restaurants/bars to enjoy drinks "Shaken, not stirred" in Town Square.YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #235I love the iconic blue and red vibe of the entrance of all Blue Martinis.

Hot Pot Caribbean Cuisine=As is the case with many hidden gems in the Valley, Hot Pot is hidden in a strip mall... it's nothing special to look at (from the outside or the inside), but when you walk in and breathe in the aroma of authentic caribbean cuisine, you know you're in for a treat.I was actually feeling like a simple salad, something light for lunch after stopping by Gangplank last week.  Roger W and Jeff M talked me into joining them for lunch, and how could I be picky when they suggested we try Hot Pot because of their positive Yelp reviews and convenient location?  I couldn't!So, when we walked in and saw the kind lady behind the counter in this "zero decor" restaurant and the menu for the day with only a few items written on a board, I sucked it up and figured "what the hell," just give it a shot!  I'm happy I did!I went with the curry chicken while Roger had a couple of veggie pockets and Jeff, the jerk chicken... It was all tasty - especially once Jeff and I added some hot sauce to ours.  I was happy to get some cabbage on the side of the chicken (and some white rice too), but I was secretly hoping they would offer a salad as well.If you like authentic Caribbean cuisine, check out Hot Pot... don't go in with expectations for anything but the food, and expect an extremely limited menu.  If you do those things, you'll be in for a treat!I definitely love jerk chicken - this is my third review of a restaurant serving jerk chicken. This restaurant is actually the closest to my house - just about a mile away, but I had never been there until I located it on the Yelp mobile app. The restaurant is located in a shopping center, right up front facing Arizona Avenue. Plenty of parking and good seating inside. They had reggae music playing and it was a comfortable environment while waiting. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the jerk chicken to go. She said they also had homemade ginger beer, so I ordered one while waiting on the food. The drink was an immediate strong hit of ginger, but settled into a nice refreshing drink.I ate the chicken when I got home. I ordered it with a side of plantains and rice/peas. She was just baking the plantains when I ordered. Those were the first bite, and they were wonderful! the rice was good, then I went for the chicken. Wow! It was the spiciest I have ever had. Two bites in and my nose was running and I had hiccups. I loved it. It was a good portion and I ate  every bit of it.With this restaurant just down the street and my experience with my first order. I definitely will be back. It would be nice with the spacious seating and good music to sit back with a ginger beer, relax, and eat it there next time. I will definitely be back.
Babaloos Cuban Cafe=Dessert:The menu claims all desserts are made in house, which immediately caught my attention. I made sure to save room for the Key Lime Pie, it was light, creamy, tangy and delicious. It was my favorite part of the meal.Libations:We ordered a mojito, Dirty Lou and a Shiner. The consensus at the our table after passing drinks around so everybody could taste them, is that the top shelf mojito could have been better, the flavors seemed a little muted. The Dirty Lou, could have been dirtier and the Shiner, while a little out of place in a Cuban restaurant, was really good.Food:We ordered the plantain appetizer, ropa, and two chicken dishes. The appetizer was so good and the spicy black bean spread that came with the order was amazing! Both chicken dishes were really, really good. The ropa was good. It was served luke warm,  which might have distracted from the flavors.Service:We arrived around 8PM on a Saturday night and it seemed they were at the end of their dinner rush. Service was friendly, albeit, not as polished. It seemed that our glasses were always empty before a refill was given.Versus Havana Cafe:Dessert- Babaloos.Appetizers- BabaloosLibations- TieRopa- Havana CafeAtmosphere- Havana CafeSpecialty Dishes- BabalooWe were tossed to the sharks for the one year anniversary event of Babloo's. There were were...mere Yelpers surrounded by the big dogs..the kids who get paid for the game...folks from the professionally published local rags. They were taking notes, smelling their wine milling over what they would write...hey wait..the only difference was I forgot my pen and we do it for free! We Yelpers do it for the love! Put me in coach. I'm ready to play.We opened the night with mojitos that were as lovely as anything i have ever had to drink.Minty...but not too much with just the right amount of sweet.Moving through courses paired perfectly with wines. Even the one wine that I didn't care for on it's own once used as a compliment to the course was very palatable. The food was delicious. Latin flair modern yet traditional. Mint used perfectly throughout. I was particularly fond of the green sauce, and the stuffed tomato was the perfect burst of flavor. And the beef dish was so perfectly prepared....mmm...The band was a perfect mood setter...and Zoe the singer,,if you read this consider it my proposal. Wow.I have a new favorite food. The cake! i am a bad latino...the dulce something or another...ZOMG! I felt slightly inappropriate eating it in public. If Zoe says no to my proposal I will gladly wed the dessert. Not to mention the amazing 40 yr aged rum they served to sip with it.They also sell cigars hand rolled by a true craftsman who was there showing the great care he put into the lovely smokes of which I took two home.I also want to give a special shout out to all of my fellow Yelpers who were there, especially Wes and Tera for the ride and company perfectly paired with a great meal and evening.
Spices Mediterranean Kitchen=It was good. Place seems clean, owner is fun, food was prepped quick and generally tasted pretty good. None of that drowning in heavy gravy boolshit. I liked it. Perhaps not the best Greek inspired food i ever had, but then i am from NYC and LI so..................."I like"So I'm retransitioning to veganism (read Skinny Bitch/Skinny Bastard for more info) and I wouldn't say this is a vegan friendly place in any way. But I tried the salad with tomatos, feta, pecans, and green leafy substance and it was really, really, really tasty. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Poor Richard Z. did not have the same luck with his beef sandwich thing. When I ordered it the owner said it was the best decision I've ever made. Well, I don't know about that... But it was certainly a very good one. He's also gave us a free Red Bull cola, which on its own merits is eh, but I very much appreciated the gesture. Cool guy. Overall, if you want to support a small business with very tasty salads, and you're near Chandler Blvd and the 101, and you don't mind that there wasn't a single female customer in the joint, this is definitely a place to consider.
Orient Sushi Grill=Disclaimer: I didn't try the sushi. I didn't need to.The wife and I actually came here because they were advertising 1 cent bottles of beer. Goes to show you our priorities... Anyway we walk into this fine establishment to find the penny beers waiting for us. Typical Bud Light/Miller Light, but who cares! They're a penny!They ambience is great. Low light, quiant booths with a bar on one side. When I use the word quaint, I don't mean small. Yes, it IS small, but it is a very pleasant small.Well, I've been on a quest to find all the yummy ramens of the valley.  Lo and behold, whats on their menu? You got it! Ramen.  Chicken or Beef or Seafood or Spicy Bonzai, you can't go wrong.  I got the beef with the Udon noodles and I SWEAR to you... they brought out a GALLON of soup. A GALLON! There wasn't much to it, but it was tasty.  Noodles, sprouts, seasoned broth, and beef.  We also ordered a plate of the Honey Chicken and it DIDN'T disappoint.  It was twice the size of PeiWei's similar dish, and MUCH tastier.  With it, came a dish of white rice.This place was right under my nose.  I will definitely be back! I want to try the spicy Bonzai ramen.  They say if you can eat 2 bowls, its free! That would be... 2 Gallons of soup.
Nosh=If you're staying at Bally's, had a long, but exciting night, and in dire need some some food to munch on without table service, Nosh is there for the rescue!It was my last night during my last visit to Vegas and by that time I really wasn't in the mood to go to a sit-down restaurant, nor travel far to grab some food elsewhere.  I was tired but luckily Nosh was there thanks to them being open 24 hours a day.  They have some really good specials like their $3 Hot Dogs and $12 Foot Long Sandwiches.   I ordered their Large Italian Sandwich and as you can see, this sandwich was loaded!! (http://bit.ly/1yLBvZS).  The bread was good and they definitely piled in the meat.  It definitely hit the spot for me before calling it a night.For being open 24 hours and offering a nice selection of sandwiches and snacks, Nosh is a dependable spot if you're staying at Bally's.
Genghis Grill=I struggled a lot on whether to give this a 3 or a 4. Honestly, I'm not happy with my decision and I'm thinking it may deserve a 3. This place is new to me, but I'm no stranger to "Mongolian BBQ" as I've been a long-time fan of YC's. Obviously I'm going to compare the two. I liked that they had fresh meat, but it was a little fatty and since they use thicker chunks as opposed to shaved and frozen, it takes longer to cook your food. They seem to stack up orders on the hot disc. It definitely lacks the flair you get when eating at YC's, but the novelty of that wears off after a few times anyway. Plus, I know it's wrong, but I prefer the frozen shaved meats to these chunks. It's just different though - I wouldn't say frozen is better, just that I prefer it. I would even go so far as to say I preferred a lot of their fixin's outside of the meat. They had a better selection of spicy powders and sauces than YC's, and this place definitely caters to the spicy food lover more. They also had better vegetables. I should also mention they have a better selection of meats including two types of beef and even shrimp and scallops. Even your choices of noodles and rice was more extensive. Come to think of it, they really beat the shit out of YC's hands down in the available food department.And taste? Well, it was delicious I must say. Of course, I assembled the dish, so if it wasn't any good I have to accept at least part of the blame if not all. If I had to compare, I'd say YC's is very reliable and good consistantly because I tend to always create roughly the same dish. GG's I could see having a much broader range of flavors and experiences. The ambiance was okay for a strip-mall restaurant. It was kinda kitschy, but charming enough and fairly comfy. They had attention to detail. I think YC's (depending on which one you go to) is a "no frills" sort of place compared to this. They were piping in some good contemporary alternative music as well... for a minute, I thought someone had lifted my ipod.Service was attentive, but odd since this is a "get your own food" kind of place... They also have menus which is strange considering you basically put your own dish together and since the server explains the process again to you in detail. I felt a bit like a child being explained something so simple and obvious, but my girlfriend had a confused look on her face, so maybe it's a good thing they do that. Regulars probably just get escorted over to the line.I think my main gripe with it was the tiny bowl they gave me for the fixin's... but then again, you aren't putting noodles or rice in there like you do at YC's - they add that as they cook it for you. So I suppose the portions are comparable. Then there's the price. A little high perhaps - maybe higher than YC's (I know they used to be 5 bucks for a lunch bowl). But you do get a lot for your money if you know how to pack the food in the bowl. So I guess I was right to give it a 4 instead of a 3... turns out I really liked it. I think this would be a real treat for someone who hasn't had Mongolian BBQ before. I consider this to be a great alternative to YC's... Impressive.This is in response to the condescending owner of Genghis Grill.  Unfortunely for you, I'm a bit more educated than your average diner.  I am a registered dietitian and I am smart enough to know the your comments on my initial review are misleading to your other customers.  First off, I have a 30 minute lunch break therefore I dont have time to drive to your restaurant and sit there for 45 minutes.  But I understand many people have 1 hour lunch breaks and they may have time for your restaurant.  This is why I chose YC's because I can get in and out of there on my time schedule.Your goober sauces are more unhealthy than most sauces with the consistancy of water.  The only way sauces get that thick consistency is being made with excessive sugar and/or fat just like BBQ sauce and mayo.  Anyone who knows anything about nutrition and asian dishes should know that "Kung Pao" sauce is one of the most calorically dense sauces.  This goes for any asian restaurant not just YC's- along with other thick sauces like General Tso and Sweet & Sour.  I could really care less about these YC's recipes considering I always make my own as many people do.   I do not want a place that pre-makes the sauces for me.Your comparison is clearly ridiculous considering the portion size you are comparing must be dramatically different.  YC's does not specify a serving size.  Neither do you!  Genghis Grill Serving Size = 0.5 ,1, or 2.  What does this mean????? g? oz? tsp? tbs? cup?  Not exactly what I'd call legitimate.   YC's charges .50 cents for a take-out box not $1.  I was charged 9.99 for lunch on a weekday for a to-go order.  So if your lunch is supposed to cost 8.99 well then you do the math.You only solidified my decision to NEVER GO BACK with your rude response.  I have only ever rated a restaurant with 1 star twice.  I usually rate generously.  My initial review was my honest opinion.  I had nothing against Genhis Grill- it just wasn't for me.  Now that you have responded this way- I will now go to the extent to letting friends and coworkers about the situation.  I'm sure you will stay busy but I will not be visiting again.Typical Mongolian BBQ grill - you get a (smallish) bowl, choose your proteins, veggies, sauces, and starches, then hand them over for cooking. They bring the finished dish to your table. I chose chicken, salmon, scallops, a variety of vegetables,  a curry sauce, and rice noodles. The resulting dish was OK, a bit on the bland side; perhaps this is because I didn't take as much sauce as I should have. The staff is friendly and helpful, but the queue at the ingredients trays moves slowly.
Create=After reading many reviews on Yelp and driving past this joint 100's of times, I finally decided to stop by today for lunch to check it out myself.  I decided to give myself a treat after a great workout at the gym.....have to give back some of the calories, right?I had no idea how it worked and the menu in the restaurant is posted at the front door facing your back when you enter...so you see it when you exit.....what the hell?  Seems very illogical to me, but whatever.  Because I didn't see the menu when I walked in, I had no idea what to do....so I asked the kid at the register, how does this work?  He kind of looked at me with a puzzled expression and said "You place an order and I take it"......he was kidding around and explained that there are specialty Burgers that I can choose from or I can "Create" my own.  You choose 1/4, 1/3, or 1/2 lb patties, the bread, and the toppings.After browsing the specialty Burgers for a minute, I decided I wanted to order two of them.  I ordered a 1/4 lb Dali Burger  with White Bread & (Avocado, Peppers, Onions, Monterey Jack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, & Southwestern Ranch) and a 1/4 lb Impressionist Burger with Onion Bread & (Cajun Seasoning, Jalapenos, Lettuce, Tomato, Pepper Jack, & Atomic Mayo w/side of BBQ Sauce) and a bottle of Water.  He suggested that I get a side of BBQ Sauce with the Impressionist Burger....I took him up on his recommendation.  Total damage ($11.73), for the Burgers & bottled Water.  The price you see on the menu is the combo price.  He issued me a number and my change and told me they would bring out the Burgers when it was ready.The restaurant has plenty of seating and nice comfortable booths....not what I expected.  They also sell Frozen Custard here....since I'm unfamiliar with what that is, I passed on trying it this visit.After a few minutes my order was delivered by the manager.  He apologized because they ran out of Guacamole and substituted it with whole Avocado on the Dali Burger....I told him that was fine.  I started to take pics of the food and when he saw me, he asked if I wanted a picture with the Burger....I laughed and said yes.  What a nice guy.I jumped into the Impressionist Burger first.....I couldn't wait to try it since it was loaded with Spicy Toppings.....I decided to take the first bite without the BBQ Sauce.  Wow....it was Spicy!  It had a very nice kick to it....not too blazing hot, but very enjoyable.  I am impressed because most joints make their mild....not this one!  Then I tried it with the BBQ Sauce per the cashier kid's advice.....yum!  The BBQ Sauce combined with the spicy flavor of the Atomic Mayo, Jalapenos, and Pepper Jack made this burger taste really good.  I wish I would have ordered a 1/3 lb patty though as the 1/4 lb seemed to be too small with all of the toppings.  The Beef was very flavorful, but I could have used more of it...next time I'll get the 1/3 or 1/2 lb patty....my bad.After devouring the Impressionist, I went for the Dali Burger.  I loaded the Avocados into the Burger and again took a bite before I tried it with the Southwest Ranch Sauce.....it was pretty good, but needed the Ranch.  I poured some of the Ranch with each subsequent bite.....wow, another excellent Burger!  The Onion Bun added to it.....another great recommendation from the cashier kid....he must eat a ton of their Burgers to figure out great combinations of stuff.Overall, it was a good experience....fresh, flavorful ingredients and the ability to customize your Burger are the highlights of this place.  The one knock would be the Bread....it was very "doughy" and just didn't do it for me.....tasted like and had the consistency of Wonder Bread.  Despite that flaw, I still gave it 4 Stars.Will I return?  I want to try some of the other specialty burgers as well as up the patty size....so, yeah I will be returning soon!
The Keg Steakhouse + Bar=Sorry to anyone who likes this place, but The Keg is a big, fat disappointment - just like the parties with the same name always were back in college. To be fair, we only went for happy hour, but the specialty drink we tried and the appetizer we ordered were both really gross. In my opinion, a restaurant needs to make a good impression at the bar because a lot of people, myself included, try places out by ordering a drink and appetizer or two. Given how bad what we tried was, what incentive do we have for returning for a bigger meal? From the outside, The Keg looks like your run-of-the-mill steakhouse; once we got inside, however, we were shocked at how sleek and upscale the decor was. The bathrooms, in particular, were gorgeous and super-clean. When we went to sit at the bar, we were expecting some really classic cocktails and satisfying appetizers. The happy hour drink special was an orange martini, so I thought I'd try it. My husband got a Heineken (1/2 off during happy hour), which can't be messed up. To eat, we ordered the sliders, which were $9.95; they didn't have any happy hour food specials. The martini was really sweet and tasted like it didn't have a drop of alcohol in it; it kind of reminded me of Sunny-D, which I hated growing up and now wouldn't serve to children if you paid me. The sliders were even worse. They were supposed to be prime-rib sliders, but I would have rather had ground chuck. The meat was chewy and fatty and reminded us of the sausage in an Egg McMuffin (which I like but wasn't expecting on a slider). There were also no toppings like onion or tomato - just a sauce or piece of cheese on each one. Instead of fries on the side, there were just measly little fried onions. Blech. We could have gone to Ruby Tuesday's right next door and gotten better sliders! In the end, we didn't spend more than $22 or so, but being a happy hour fanatic, I know that there are plenty of other places (Latitude 30 is a notable example) where we could go and spend the same amount and get some great appetizers and drinks. We definitely won't be back.3 girls on a thursday night decided steak sounded necessary.as two of us waited for the 3rd girl to arrive our waiter stops by and says 'when is your friend getting here? i don't want to explain the menu a bunch of times.'uh ok.we ordered the bacon wrapped scallops to start. believe it or not it was my FIRST TIME having scallops! I am not a big seafood eater but I would eat these again. tasty. while we browsed the menu trying to make a selection the waiter came by and was like 'will you close your menu when you're ready so that i don't have to keep coming by your table?' blank stares from us. seriously? wtf? we're chatty girls wanting to enjoy a nice, not rushed dinner. he pops by again and asks if we're ready. thankfully one of my friends has more balls than me and says 'my menu is still open and i'm following your rules so...' and he walked away.we closed our menus to signal our waiter and we ordered escargot, prime rib, salads, soup etc.the escargot was another first for me! it was tasty but i wouldn't order it again. glad i tried it though! my prime rib was ok, definitely not the best i've ever had. we also ordered the creme brulee and it was good...nothing amazing. while this was a place of many first for me, it will be my first and last time visiting bc of the rude waiter.  the prices aren't worth the food and service.I have been back 3 times since my last visit and can easily say my last experience isn't the norm. And I haven't seen that waiter since so perhaps he found a job outside of customer service?? I talked to the manager and they were so amazing at handling the situation. Seriously major kudos! I probably wouldn't have been back if it weren't for them and it's now become a spot we frequent. The service has been great ever since as well. The last 2 times I went I had the pecan crusted steak which is great. My friends all swear by the French onion soup and order it everytime. I'll have to try it next time.We came in recently again as a group for a going away party for one of my BFFs. We ordered 3 desserts- the crème brulee, the coffee ice cream pie and the brownie sundae. BEST BROWNIE SUNDAE. We all ended up not really even finishing the other desserts because they didn't even compare to that one. So this is what you should order:French onion souppecan crusted steakbrownie sundaeI wonder how their steak is here but don't EVER come here for happy hour with a big group. No joke. I came here the other day with a pretty big group for happy hour. The service was horrible, the food and drinks were mediocre. For drinks, I ordered the Orange Slice to start. It was a martini but tasted like a screwdriver with a splash of vodka. My second drink was the Pinot Noir. This one I liked. For food, we ordered the crab cakes, nachos and baked brie. The cheese on the nachos was really dry and didn't taste very fresh to me. I actually liked the baked brie. The cheese and pesto that it came with was really good. Service.. I've never been a waitress and I understand we were with a big group but I would think you would go around the whole group asking what everyone wanted. Plus there were 2-3 waitresses helping with our group. Never once did that happen. We basically had to flag down the waitress every time we wanted to order something. On top of that, we asked her for the happy hour menu maybe 3 times or more and she never once brought it. We ended up talking to the manager who eventually brought the menu and told him we were very disappointed in the service. We got an apology. I would've thought he could've at least gave us a small discount on the bill, or something complimentary. Anything. Nope. I won't be back for happy hour.
St-Viateur Bagel & Café=So, unfortunately my lack of stars reflects the service, not the food- but only because the awful attitude we received truly made it hard to enjoy my bagel. Being from the US and knowing no French, we accidentally ordered bagels at the to-go counter and then wished to sit down. When we asked for plates, we got such a sigh and eye roll. We weren't trying to avoid a fee, tipping, or cheat the system. We were simply mistaken, and had we been corrected we'd have been happy to correct whatever it was that had upset this waitress so much.  Instead, we were given plates and knives with disdain and felt awkward as we tried to enjoy our bagels.Trust me, I would have preferred my bagel toasted! Had I understood how things worked I would have done it right. I would encourage staff to be a bit more patient. We never got any explanation of how to get seated service, so we were at a loss.Bottom line: for those who want the full bagel experience and are from out of town, don't walk up to the to-go counter by accident! However, I'll be darned if I know what you're SUPPOSED to do! Someone local might want to chime in and let those pesky tourists know! We'd love to be in the loop!
Restaurant Jano=Everyone always goes on about Romados this and Romado's that (granted, I'm guilty of it too), but if you're craving some seriously scrumptious and authentic Portuguese grill, you owe it to yourself to visit Jano. Whether you're starting simple with the quarter chicken combo, or swinging for the big leagues with their five meat plate (for two), you are guaranteed to leave with a smile on your face. All the proteins are prepared to perfection: squid, rabbit, duck, lamb chops, chicken... these guys are seriously masters of the grill. A simple salad and fries round out the plate.And if you're feeling bold, go ham on the hot sauce. But be warned, they are not messing around with that weak shit. This is some serious hotness.
Phil's Grill=Ahhh...the lingering country club lunches at Phil's Grill. Those were the days. When I lived in the white, homogenized and frankly, boring, world called DCRanch, I often met up with my roomie at Phil's. Sort of the anti Zipp's sports bar. Of course there are the obligatory plasma tvs. The views of the course are great as you nestle into a comfie sofa . I felt like the old farts in the movie Trading Places. We'd sit in those big leather chairs by the fireplace and count our money. Once, I counted $27 in one pocket alone! The food here is fantastic, as it should be for a mogul like myself. Favorites include the Sonoran chicken pasta with fresh grilled corn, the prime rib slider (how old  money is that?!) and the Southwestern wrap. The menu does include high end steaks running up to $37 or so. I would have ordered that. But was unable to find another $10 in my other pockets.
Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and Grill=Nice place for what a pizza place has to offer.$8.95 for a Balsamic Grilled Chicken Salad (that can feed 2 if your ordering pizza etc.) You can get the $14.95 plate. Maybe that feeds 4?$9.95 for the Margherita: Roma Tomatoes, Garlic, Fresh Basil.Tasty good. Asked for extra garlic didn't seem to make it on this order. Or it could be the Garlic Cheese Bread ($5.95) was head & shoulders more "garlicy" so the pizza paled in comparison?Before, I have tasted some left over Thai Chicken pizza that was in the fridge at home, it was very tasty. Will try it fresh out the oven eventually. The Messy Sundae ($8.50)My visit was for a B-Day. (FREE they said on B-Day) This is a Very Tall (stands what looked like 1-1/2 ft.) sundae glass cascading with chocolate over a couple of scoops of icecream.It was fine finish to the stay!Mixed bag as far as customers go, the retired, the first date, the small family, even a table of kids babysitting themselves. Kids Menu available.Wait staff is on it. Lets call this a Pizza Restaurant with polished details and an upscale menu. Check it out. 3 other Las Vegas location with another opening soon S.Rainbow. And 10 more in SoCal.Only thing I noticed, at least for this time of year, the Sun crashes through the windows from off to the left. So be aware. They have blinds but I noticed that those annoying little streaks still get through for some time.I'll check it out again and get better layout details. for ya'all.-------------------------------------------------------------------------6/10/08Back again.Kids wars. Cell Phone wars. wtf!?Salad was nice again.Thia Chicken Pizza was good indeed.Of all things to order someone got a Pepperoni. Looked like shit. Kinda pooled up some oil. Yay, lunch tomorrow. I guess if you stick with things that you can't get at Pizza Hut your ok here. Duck Tacos for one.........next time, next timeCame for Happy Hour which is 4-6 daily now. Half off tapas and drinks (wine and beer)...only beer that was sounding decent was Sierra Nevada so skipped out this time. One nice surprise too is for the month of April Favorites and New Stuff are half off also (4 kinds of new pizza- tuscan, caprese, sicilian, diavola and 1 artisan type- feta, ahi sliders, chicken chile tacos, kobe chili, white tuna salad).Had mini duck tacos- these were so cute! They were good too though...nice bbq flavor on the duck and like the feta with it.Tuscan pizza- prosciutto, artichoke, olives, arugula. It was pretty good but with prosciutto and olives it made it a tad too salty and kinda made all the rest of the food salty.Ahi sliders- one of my favorite things here...3 sliders and comes with seasoned fries and a pickle. Pretty good patty, slightly spicy.Not too much beer selection, but they do have some Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Decent, fresh, goes with everything we're eating.Service was good..never had to ask for another drink and I'm a thirsty one needing several refills of ice tea! Best all- this is like a few blocks away from the house so good to drop in for HH.I've come in a few times for Happy Hour tapas- they're pretty good and you can't beat the price. One note I wanted to put is that I had the Lebni cheese tonight. I like their flatbread and I like soft cheeses and Mediterranean spices... they put a spice mix on the cheese and all over the bread. I shook the bread and a lot of spices fell off so I would maybe recommend to just get spices on the cheese and tell them to skip the bread since apparently it is the norm to throw on that much spice mix. They replaced it with a new one right away. Got some duck tacos which are always good. Braised asparagus with Romano shavings, balsamic and prosciutto- perfectly cooked veggie. I eat a lot of "real" Italian food and this is something we definitely would have at dinner since it's clean fresh, simply done flavors.Service has always been decent here so I don't have any big complaints about this location.
The Grill Next Door=Ugh! After an afternoon spent at home depot picking out doors and faucets for our first house, my lovely and I had worked up an appetite.  We knew we wanted a patio, probably a brew, some lunch and a comfy table to discuss the handful of paint swatches we had in tow.  So, Tempe was the answer until on our way there we noticed this retro looking hamburger joint with a Miller High-life banner hanging in the window.  We decided to skip the drive and go for it, there was even a patio.We walked up and the first thing we saw was a freaky mannequin dressed in a stripper/"nurse" outfit placed in the window of the 500 sq ft building.  As soon as we entered the front door, it became clear that the mannequin wasn't the only one sporting this skimpy attire.  The waitresses also had on cheeky skirts, white fishnets, and boobs popping out of their blouses.  This was a sorry attempt as the class of the place left me feeling like I was at some Mesa dive bar, or better yet Band-Aids with burgers.  Creepy men were scattered throughout the tiny place drooling.  Just when I thought it couldn't get any stranger (or funnier!) I spotted the makeshift  bulletin board of the waitresses (all 2 of them) with 50+ pictures of them complete with handwritten captions, and numerous old creepy men like the ones there that afternoon.  It was hard for to believe this place was real, or that someone actually took it seriously!With grumbling bellies and confused looks on our faces we decided to order a couple of PBR's (either PBR or High-life the only 2 choices of brew), and took it to the cement patio.  After a brief glance at the one page menu: Hamburger, double, hot-dog, or fries, we decided to chug our 3 buck beers and find another lunch spot.Summing it all up, my bf said to me "I'm sure the burgers would've been good, I would just never eat there", followed by "Hey, they're just trying to make a buck".  Try harder...What a waste of a great location.I didn't come here for the anorexic Asian or the brunette who lacked personality. I didn't come here because they show off their rib cages.. I came here to eat. The place is a gimmick inside a gimmick. They only offer PBR and Miller High Life. Their sodas are in bottles, with the Coke being Mexican glass bottled coke, which as we all know is fuckin' delicious. The menu consists of Single 1/2 lb. burger, Double, Triple, hot dog, french fries or onion rings. The burgers start at $8, going up $2 increments for every towering patty added. Fries or Rings are extra. The god damn burgers are  monstrous. With a double being probably 6" tall. But the Chef in me was a little puzzled at the timing of the food. The cook must of been bending the laws of thermodynamics because I got 1 lb. of cooked ground beef that was hot mind you, in 8 minutes. That tells me that they have the burgers "sandbagged" in the back. (Sandbag is a culinary term for partially cooked and ready to go.)The burger comes dressed with chili, American and Swiss cheese, and tomatoes. I paid $14 for coke, Double Burger and order of fries. Not "too" bad. Tax is included in the prices. I'd come back again, with my Ol' man. The food is guy food and the flagrant arm touches the 19 year old servers dish out is enough to keep my old man breathing another day...
Raku=My wife found out about this place through Mixi which is kind of like a Japanese myspace.  Its only been open for 3 weeks and we've wanted to try another izakaya style place besides Ichiza (which was packed for Memorial Day) so we gave this place a go.The place is a bit small, not great for groups of over 4 but the atmosphere wasn't bad.  I guess I prefer Jpop over koto music but it was fine.  Their specialty is their yakitori (grilled on a stick) type stuff.  We went w/ the chicken thigh ($2 a piece), wasabi kobe beef ($9), asparagus bacon ($2) and the tsukune which is grilled ground chicken on a stick.  Everything we had tasted awesome.  Not sure what they're putting in their grill for the flavoring but its fantastic and addictive.  You can definitely tell that the ingredients used here are of higher quality than Ichiza but the menu is a lot smaller and aside from the yakitori, pricier too.  Ofcourse we weren't full from all the above so we tried some of the rice dishes along with oden (a winter food boiled in a soup..kinda like a hot pot).  My wife got the Tororo don which is gooey potato mixed w/ soy sauce that she loves but I find inedible while I had the ikura don which is salmon roe eggs w/ seaweed on rice.  Both of these cost around $10 a piece and the portions were pretty small.  Just one small bowl of rice w/ the topping.  Definitely disappointed w/ that.  My wife was also bummed that they didn't have natto.  The oden was tasty though.  We ordered the chikuwa (fish stick), konnyaku and daikon which were all around $1.50-$2 a piece.They only have Sapporo beer but they do have a nice list of sake, shochu and wines which would make this a nice place for some beverages and small food.  I would also recommend just buying the pitcher of beer at $22 a pop as opposed to the $5 glass if your party plans on drinking at least 4 glasses.  You get a WHOLE lot more w/ the pitcher!!!!!  The bathroom was funny too as they only have a single unisex stall but they put a bunch of fake flowers on the ceiling w/ a speaker playing bird noises the entire time.  Priceless.  Overall, I would rate this place 3.5 stars but its closer to 4 than 3.   I am just sticking to the grilled stuff the next time we go back as the rice dish portions are way too overpriced.  A few tables ordered the deep juicy fried chicken ($8) which looked awesome too so maybe we'd get that next time.  They're open til 3am which is cool.  Most patrons there were Japanese..I think I was 1 out of 3 that weren't. So yeah..this is a good alternative to Ichiza although I wouldn't say its better...just different.Wow, just wow.  We've been living in Vegas for years now, and to have a place this good that's not attached to some casino (and hence overpriced or blown out of proportion) is just fantastic.The place is small and intimate.  It can only hold about 30 people at the most, but any wait you have to deal with is worth it for the food.  The wait staff themselves were very nice, friendly, and knowledgeable on the dishes.One of the standouts was the Tofu Special ($9).  I am a dyed-in-the-wool carnivore, but that's a dish that I could easily eat several times a week and not miss a burger.  It's homemade Tofu, fried a bit, then served in a fantastic broth with a smattering of hot sauce on the bowl's rim for you to use with each bite.  You'll want to drink up the broth it's so tasty!Other standouts (although everything was good) were the Kobe skewer, the spicy peppers, the hot chicken appetizer (chicken in crispy chicken skin), and the asparagus wrapped in bacon.  For desert, they had a strawberry sorbet that's not listed on the menu, which was also excellent.We got there right around opening (6 PM) and it was already half full.  What another reviewer said is true -- people take their time in here, so make a reservation if you're over a party of two!My wife and I decided that if we just wanted an amazing desert, we'd hit Ichiza for the Honey Toast.  However. for anything else, Raku is where it's at!Raku has been getting quite a buzz from the Las Vegas community, especially because it's one of those off-the-strip type places meant just for locals.  It's a Japanese restaurant that specializes more in yakitori and street food.  (As other have mentioned, they do offer some sashimi, but that's not why you come here.)With a party of four, we got to try a bunch of different things:* Raku's Tofu ($4) - Highly recommended by our waiter since he said they are the only one in Vegas that makes their own.  It's uniquely presented as a homemade tofu and comes with sides of grated ginger, scallions, and bonito shavings.  The texture and taste can be a bit surprising at first as it's definitely not your commercial tofu. But once you add a bit of the sides, and a little soy, it tastes pretty good actually.* Sea Urchin and Seaweed with Soup ($4) - Presented in an individual bowl, two coils of uni rest on a bed of seaweed in a light broth.  The uni was good, and a bit different because of the warmth of the broth.  I enjoyed this dish and would get it again.* Daikon Radish and Soft Fish Cake Oden ($1.50/pp) - Their Oden menu consists of ordering individual pieces and they are all placed together as they have been stewing.  The daikon was less than memorable, something I wouldn't have ordered on my own nor again.  The fish cake was good though, although not something I particularly crave.  The side of hot wasabi mustard adds some much needed heat and taste to this dish.  Definitely use it.* Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi ($9/pp) - Expensive, but good.  Depending on how the wasabi hits your mouth, it can be a shot up your nose or an enjoyable piece of meat.* Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic ($6) - The crispy slices of fried garlic is what makes this beef really good.  I think it's actually tastier than the Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi.* Chicken Breast wrapped with Chicken Skin ($2.50/pp) - Chicken breast is always boring to me, but what makes this enjoyable would probably be the fatty chicken skin.  The Big F enjoyed this, but it's not something I would order again.* Chicken Wing ($1.50) - I personally didn't get a taste, but the guys in my party enjoyed it.* Grilled Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce ($4) - The duck was very tasty and had a nice sauce to it.  Cooked well and enjoyable.* Mushroom Wrapped with Bacon ($2/pp) - Mushroom and bacon, need I say more? Good stuff.* Kurobuta Pork Cheeks ($2.50) - This is really good stuff, really fatty bad for you stuff I'm sure, but really good!  Eat it when it's hot!* Enoki Mushroom Wrapped in Bacon ($2.50) - The enoki adds a slightly different taste and texture that makes it really enjoyable to eat.  Both the bottom and top of the mushroom are texturally different as well.* Ground Chicken Portabella ($3.50) - Grilled portabellas are always good, add some chicken and seasonings and you can't go wrong. * Lamb Chop ($5) - The waiter claimed their lamb chops were fabulous and had people returning just for them. And I do admit, they were really good.  Nicely cooked to a medium rare and juicy!* Grilled Rice Ball ($5 for two) - The soy sauce grilled rice ball is tastier than the rice ball wrapped in the green leaf, so we ordered just this one.  We tried ordering the Potato with Corn ($2.50), but they just ran out, same for the Foie Gras ($12).  They have daily specials that sound interesting, but be sure to ask about the price.Service was okay.  With about three wait staff people, I had to ask for my tea to be refilled almost every single time.  (They should have just left the pot for me after my fourth refill.)  They also never bothered refilling our water.  With all the sodium, liquids were necessary!The menu is simple, but can be a bit overwhelming your first time there.  We found the whole Oden (Dashi Broth Pot) menu to be a bit daunting with the per piece charge and probably wouldn't have ordered anything from here if it were just the Big F and I.  The Robata Grill menu is where it's all out.  However, since they charge per skewers, you'll end up ordering the $28 Kobe Beef Steak and not realize it!  Their Rice/Noodle/Soup menu sounds good, but worries me when I read "Bite Size Salmon Roe Bowl" for $10.  Is it really bite-size?In regards to the bathroom, I didn't see what the big deal was.  Sure, it's aesthetically pleasing with bird sounds and fake flowers.   But nothing worth making a special visit out of it.  It's a new restaurant and a new bathroom, therefore it's clean!As recommended, make reservations.  It wasn't really necessary last Friday evening when we went, but it does fill up and people do take their time.  So I would definitely try to make reservations if my party is more than two.  Overall, we did enjoy our experience here, but found it to be quite expensive.  $150 for 4, including tip and tax, with no alcohol seems a bit costly.  (None of us were 'full' since we headed over to Luv-It's for dessert!)3.5 stars.(Pics posted!)This is Vegas' saving grace when it comes to Asian food.  I'll bet on Raku anytime against any Japanese restaurant in the United States...  that's how AWESOME Raku is!I showed up at midnight on my way home from a restaurant Sunday night.  I've heard of Raku for a long time and I thought I'd at least go check out where it is.  I found it, it was empty, so I walked in.  I might as well have stepped across the Pacific Ocean when I crossed that entrance.  It was a different world.Kani, the sashimi chef and condiment mixologist, greeted me.  Rei, the restaurant manager, joined in and I sat myself at the bar.  I was full, but I could sense it wasn't your ordinary late night restaurant -- it was magical -- and I wanted to stay.  So I ordered a beer, one for Kani, one for me.  I chatted with him and Rei about Vegas and random stuff.Kani is a world traveler, having worked in San Francisco, New York, Hong Kong and now Vegas.  His friend, 10 years his junior, opened Raku and invited him to join in the operation as they worked together when they were back in New York.  He likes Vegas, though he doesn't think much of his local competitors in Japanese food.  The only alcoholic drink he'll drink is beer because he is at work.  He'll tell you what's fresh, so just ask.  He mixes the sauces in the restaurant himself...  and let me tell you, they are great condiments to the grilled skewers.There's a mild but complex soy sauce that is a blend of different types of soy sauce and other mixtures, one of which is green tea.  There is a chili pepper blend that has a nice bite to it and a pepper soaked in some blend that is making my mouth water as I recall topping my kurobuta pork cheeks with it last night.  The salt has ground green tea mixed in.  There is a careful level of attention paid to every level of culinary experience at this place.At that time, the restaurant was empty.  It reminded me of that painting, Nighthawks at the Diner, though Raku is nothing like that diner in that painting.  Raku is very intimate and elegantly decorated inside.  Dark lit...  it had a retro / nostalgic feel to it.  The fact that it was empty must have been because it was late and the economy is really hurting...  but Kani says they still get a late night rush before they close.  They're really busy from when they open at 6 pm to 11 pm -- so if you want to chat with the chef or staff, come late.I never imagined I can have this good quality food late at night.  I always thought I'd have to resort to IHOP or some other gastronomic compromise -- but with Raku, you get good quality, late night food and good company.  It's your Vegas Japanese Cheers.  Three cheers for Raku!Banzai!  Banzai!  Banzai!Amy C. I must thank you.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  You were the last droplets of water in my canteen that got me across the desert and showed me safe passage through Las Vegas, and helped me avoid the massive amount buffet food and pricey celebrity chef endorsed restaurants that line the strip.  I never expected to find, Japanese food that would not only cure my cravings, but also cure my homesickness of living out of a suitcase in a hotel.We ordered quite a bit of items, and reviewing my photos, we came  pretty close to about 17 dishes between the three of us, and boy we left full!  I enjoyed each dish that came out but I will highlight a few that were so good, that they almost knocked me out of my seat. The Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe was from the cold appetizer section, what more could you ask for, three eggs from three different animals are in this dish, throw in nameko mushrooms, and thin slices of okra in a light soy based sauce, you get a dish with an amazing texture.  I'm sure it the type of texture that can horrify some people who aren't used to it, because of the slimy texture that all these ingredients bring to the table, but just by pouring this on our rice, the flavors, the textures it all worked.  I grew up with this texture, and I was instantly swept up in waves of nostalgia from my childhood as I ate this dish.  I loved this dish.The Fried Homemade Tofu in Hot Broth, agedashi dofu is another dish that I love.  And I've had great ones, and quite a few not so great ones, but this one was delicious, it had the consistency and texture you can only get from homemade tofu, additionally, they choose to keep it in a larger block rather then to cut it into smaller cubes for the purpose of allowing you to actually be able to taste the tofu, with the crispy fried batter, swimming in a tentsuyu broth with green onion, salmon roe and nameko mushrooms.  Yaki onigiri was great and I liked how they did the traditional soy sauce one, but then did another one sandwiched in between shiso leaves and a little miso paste.  The only little critique I had on the soy sauce one was I wished they cooked it on the robata grill a little longer, I do like to getting a little char on it and I love to munch on the little crispy bits of rice on my onigiri.  But that is just a personal preference of mine.  Grilled Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce - The duck was perfectly cooked, it had a little color inside and the balsamic soy sauce provided a nice seasoning and acidity to the dish.Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi - I had this in a few steakhouses back in Japan.  It took me back.Potato with Corn - This dish perplexed me and all of my dinner companions.  It was delicious, but more so we were in deep conversation during the consumption of this and for the duration of our trip, "How in the world did he do this?"  We have a couple of ideas in principal, but how the person who did this and executed it so flawlessly, we are honestly still at a loss.  I think just order it, try it and you will see what we were on about. For dessert we the sorbet flavors of the day, they had a Mandarin Sorbet and Watermelon Sorbet.  I would probably have to say that their sorbet had larger ice crystals, (leading to a texture more similar to a granita siciliana) compared to a sorbet which has smaller ice crystals creating a much smoother texture.  Definitions of texture aside, both sorbets were very good and was a nice way to cleanse the pallet.  We also ordered the Meltin' and Creamy Chocolate Cake, on our server's recommendation, they make this one to order and they need at least 15-20 minutes to make this dessert, we were in no rush, we were enjoying our meal.  It was basically a molten chocolate cake, and with our first cut with the spoon, it gushed out.  The cake was dense and moist, with the molten fudge inside, and a little green tea ice cream, which complemented the dessert.Overall, I wouldn't have expected to find a restaurant like this all the way out in Vegas.  We came for a late dinner, so we had no line, but now that I know that they serve food like this, it's going to be worth the wait.  Now if you are the type of person where the words "all you can eat" or "the world's biggest" sounds appealing, I'm not sure this is the place for you.  But if you like a little variety, and enjoy eating in a tapas style (little plates), believe me, you will leave here full and very satisfied... added bonus you don't have to win big in Vegas to eat here, prices for what you get are extremely reasonable.  This hidden gem, requires a car or taxi to get off the beaten path in Las Vegas but it was worth the effort.  I can't wait to go back.  (I already have a wish list on things I want to try next time....)Thank you Amy C.!  You saved me.Forget Korean tacos, hello Japanese tapas!This was one of my favorite meals in Sin City and it was off the strip, tucked in a mini-mall. I was surprised at how hot this restaurant was on Yelp because it was tiny and unpretentious... unlike the rest of LV. We had the: - Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe- Fried Homemade Tofu in Hot Broth- Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi- Kurobuta Pork Cheek- Foie Gras- Enoki Mushroom Wrapped with Bacon- Cold Udon Noodle with Foie Gras Custard Soup- Fluffy CheesecakeEverything was small but incredibly flavorful. All the meats danced and melted on my tongue. You know a restaurant is a winner when it can charge $10 for tofu and I can leave without bitching, whining, or crying. The only item that I wouldn't order again is the cheesecake, but then again--I should've known better than to get that at a charcoal grill.I wish Raku would move to SF... because I'm not that interested in relocating to LV.I love this restaurant!  Must return (but this is but one more reason to come to LV) !!! *6 Solid Stars*pix laters...- 1 STAR for the attitude with reservationsYesterday was a blur and needed my Raku fix on! Grateful for an awesome company, we were greeted with friendship and hospitality, thanks to Satay's own Saturday nights Patio Sessions resident DJ Nathan Sense Uhlir, who splurged us with a pitcher of Sapporo beer and a side of laughs throughout dinner.It has been a while since my last visit to Raku and I was pleased that Raku expanded their restaurant with a new room. The table that we sat in was really cool. It had an open rectangular shape in the middle of our booth/table that had a mini traditional/organic barbecue pit.Mr. Uhlir ordered most of the items on the special black board menu and everything was fantastic! I only wish that I had written down the names, but since I didn't my list of items in US version as follows:Homemade cold and hot tofu.Raw cold meat with amazing edible accessories on top & a drop of sauceSpecial Toro Dish (seared fatty tuna)Special grilled Salmon collar bonefrom the Robatta Grill:Enoki Mushroom wrapped with BaconGreen Hot Chili Pepper Kurobuta Pork CheekAnd last but not least: Soba buckwheat noodle salad with amazing secret dressing! Each time we order this salad, we drink the excess dressing like soup! I LOVE RAKU! Service and food never fails and last night, I had tears of joy in my Raku!Raku reminds me that I'm in Vegas, grossly overpriced for a lot of stuff. But if you're willing to be fork over the cash, you will no doubt get quality, just don't expect to get value out of your meal.* Foie gras OOOOO    M          M   GGGGGO         O    M M   M M  G     O         O    M    M    M  G   G    GOOOOO    M           M  GGGGGsays it all. its one of those things you just don't want to know what it is or how its obtain, but is good.* Yellowtail Carpaccio - Fresh, clean, and refreshing taste. Personally I think Ichiza's Yellowtail Tar Tar taste much better and cheaper as well.* Enoki mushroom + Bacon - Bacon tends to be salty, but somehow Raku was able to take the saltyness out of the bacon so it doesn't overpower the enoki mushroom. Nicely executed item.* Sawagani (Japanese River Crab) - This has a lot of wow factor when you first see it. The novelty quickly wears off when you eat them. Nothing really special about them in the taste department. The bigger crabs have less flavor than the smaller ones because all you get is shell on the big ones.* Uni + Seaweed Miso Soup - The uni was incredibly fresh and has a surprising sweetness to them. The seaweed miso soup didn't overpower the taste of the uni. If they served this nigri style, it would taste even more awesome. * Kobe Beef + Wasabi - Good, but not the melt in your mouth taste I come to expect with Kobe beef. The wasabi was also very light tasting.* Kobe Beef Liver - You think you're getting Kobe Beef for the first few bites, than when you're about to swallow you get the liver taste. A good item to get even to get even if you don't like liver.* Lamb Chop - Perfectly cooked medium rare. Very tasty and just juicy. How can Wynn & Texas de Brazil fail so badly cooking lamb.* Rice Balls - Miso flavored riceballs. $5 for 2. Nothing special and so not worth it.* Drunken Garlic Clams - Fresh clams with a good broth. This is reminiscence of the equally tasting stuff at Naked Fish.* Lava cake - Its a lava cake. Nothing really special from the other lava cakes I've tried before.* Cinnamon + Chocolate Pudding - This is like milk with chocolate and cinnamon remnants. The waitress said to mix well and I did. A lighter chunky version of chocolate milk?* Cheesecake - Cheesecake tends to be very heavy in cheese taste, but it was beaten so it tastes very light, but still taste the cheese. It makes you feel like you can eat this all day and not feel guilty about it. The lightness of the cheese works on this desert. The wait staff is very friendly, helpful, and attentive. Nothing more you can ask from the wait staff.But service isn't perfect. When you're eating at Raku, expect to stay 1 hour at the minimum since food comes out very slow at first. But if you do order a lot of items, they come out one right after another. Reservations is absolutely required, I've been denied numerous times till I finally went during the middle of the week. Ladies, if a guy asks you where you want to eat, Ichiza or Raku and he's paying, say Raku and bash your eyelashes and smile at him. Guys, don't even mention Raku no matter what kind of cute looks she may give you, you're wallet will thank you!Raku has good food, but you pay a steep price for the ambiance and each item that isn't really that special compared to Ichiza. Raku is a lot more consistent than Ichiza, but Ichiza has the advantage of being able to try multiple things when you be lucky to get 1 item at Raku.Been to Raku at least 25-30 times since they opened. Being a part of the industry crowd it was awesome to have a late night place with the kinda food I like. This town is crying for better food without having to go to the strip or some shitty chain restaurant. I think that restaurants have spent years taking advantage of the fact that a lotta peeps still have the buffet mentality. Most bang for the buck even if it's frozen, reheated then slathered in mayonnaise. The quality of the food, presentation, setting etc is exceptional and should be the standard for restaurant expectations. People are tripping when they say Raku is overpriced. If you are that cheap and don't understand good food then stick to all you can eat sushi or the $10 buffet. Compared to any Japanese restaurant in the country for the prices they charge the food is phenomenal stars. However the issue I have is my last 2 visits. I saw a big change in their service staff from last year, not sure what happened. The old lady BTW is A FUCKING RUDE BITCH. Yes I come from an Asian background in culinary as well and what the hell is your problem after we spend $300 - $400 every time we go there??? Last couple of times they were out of numerous menu items. Understandably they prep x amount per day, but not once did they say that items were not available until we tried to order. It was annoying to the point that I finally asked the waitress to just tell me what they did not have. She next proceeded to repeat what I had already ordered, but was not available. Thanks. This happened several times. Getting drink order and refills was a major pain in the ass. The first round of food we ordered, all cold apps took nearly 50 minutes. In addition, some items we ordered the waitress came back 30 minutes later to tell us they were sold out. Table wasn't even bussed then somewhere near the 3rd round of food they came and pulled plates that we were still working on. All in all the service during my last 2 visits was almost nonexistent. Maybe it was the fact that on one of those visits the owner had a big party of friends on one table and that was their primary focus of the night. Who knows? I've seen lots of people being comped items and that doesn't bother me. The only thing I would expect is to have someone at least come to check on our drinks, bus the table without having to wait 25 minutes and at least keep us informed when food is going to take an hour. I love the food there and I would still recommend it to anyone, but the service has plainly gone to shit.Pains me that I can't give this place 4 or even 5 stars!  The food and service really were outstanding.  BUT and this is a big BUT, my brother and I got a major case of food poisoning from eating a semi cooked oyster appetizer there, which all but ruined the last night of my bachelor party in vegas.   While I know that the extreme heat in Las Vegas makes it difficult to properly refrigerate shell fish to prevent contamination , there's no reason why a place which charges high end prices for japanese food should let this happen.  I'm sure we either got a case of rotovirus or vibrio, whatever it was, it was horrendous.  I almost collapsed at the encore craps table and then proceeded to spend the next 24 hours attached to the toilet.  If you do go, AVOID the oyster! You'll thank me for this later.Update:Despite trying to contact the owner several times, i was consistently ignored until I wrote a letter to the Nevada Public Health Service who promptly did launch an investigation. The response, well it was a short email that didn't even admit guilt for our illness.  YES there are several very positive reviews for this place, but if you get sick here DON'T expect an ounce of sympathy from the owner.  Just be prepared to crap you brains out and deal with it yourself!WOW.I made late night reservations for Raku on a Thursday night.  As a fan of nearby Ichiza and their izakaya cuisine, I had heard that Raku served similar fare but was even better.  I was skeptical, but my sister swore by the place as well, having visited Raku along with some foodie friends of hers.  If it hadn't been for her insistence, I'm not sure I would have squeezed a visit in my busy schedule.I am SO glad I did.  The taxi driver took us for a 10 minute drive off the strip into Chinatown where Raku is located.  A stereotypical strip mall store front greets you but inside the decor is modern and clean despite the small interior space.  Patrons were at every table and it's clear late night dining is their strength as they open til 2 am.    After a brief wait, our seats opened and we began to peruse the extensive menu.  Grilled yakitori items, oden broths, appetizers, and plentiful drinking choices greeted us.  Our plan of attack was simple: try a few things, get a few drinks, and continue as warranted.Hours later, I had come to a clear conclusion : Raku is quite simply the best Japanese restaurant I have ever been to and one of the best restaurants PERIOD that I have ever enjoyed.  As a huge fan of this type of Japanese cuisine, the preparation and presentation of all the dishes blew me away and it's been a long time since I've enjoyed a meal quite as much as I enjoyed this one.  Kudos to my sis.  A few standouts from among the 13 dishes I had:House-made Cold and Hot agedashi tofu - supremely fresh and soft with a hint of sweetness, I enjoyed both presentations.  The cold version is served with their signature green tea sea salt and their raku house soy sauce.  Both taste completely unlike any condiment you've had and enhance the cold tofu wonderfully.  The hot tofu is served in a rich oden broth and served with salmon roe.  Need I say more?Beef Tendon Oden Broth and Meat Intestine Oden Broth - $1.50 each.  Are you kidding me???  $1.50?!?!  That's it???  The single serving of tendon and intestine was flavorful, tender, and complemented wonderfully by the fantastic oden broth they make in house here.  I could order bowls of this stuff and stay all day.Shima Aji Sashimi - fantastic cuts, served in three ways - on top of fresh seaweed, on top of soft glass noodles, and on top of a sauce.  Fresh as can be....how do they get that in the dessert?Nagareko - braised abalone in broth.  One of the most tender abalones I've tasted and not the least bit overdone.  A strong delicious broth of seaweed accompanied it and enhanced the abalone flavor and aroma.  Top notch special.Grilled enoki mushroom with bacon, asparagus with bacon, and Grilled chicken yakitori - I've had yakitori at many places, most notable Sumika in Los Altos, but this was the best I've ever had.  Fantastic flavors, super tender, and absolutely crispy high quality bacon.  It simply is another level beyond yakitori I've had before.  Can't beat the $2-3 yakitori prices either (besides Kobe beef)Seafood with bonito guts - a favorite at Kappo Nami Nami in Mountain View, bonito guts are salted bonito intestines that go wonderfully with sake.   Their version is mixed with high quality sashimi and uni.  Besides the food highlights, the drink menu is outstanding and goes wonderfully with the food.  Fusion cocktails, Japanese specialty beers, and an extensive sake litter  the menu.  But it was the wonderful hot house sake that I loved for both it's sweetness and it's modest $7 price per bottle.  If there are any misses at Raku, they are the oyakodon (the one dish that disappointed....egg slightly overdone) and the desserts (interesting but not mindblowing).  Otherwise, Raku is one of the best Japanese restaurants I've had and I immediately wanted to return the next day.  They have long been a top Yelp restaurant and even been named Restaurant of the Year.  The hype matched the reality.  For you NorCal Japanese fans, think of the best of Gochi, Sumika, Kappo Nami Nami combined and at even better prices and better quality.  I'm not sure you'll find food this good except in Japan.  It's simply that great.  Reservations are a must and late night dining is encouraged to avoid crowds.  Raku accepts credit cards, including American Express.Immaculate flavors...instructions included.After weeks of anticipation, my dinner at Raku finally arrived last night.  The fact that this place exists where it does is curiously incredible; somewhere very special nestled in an extremely unspecial looking shopping center.  A few minutes after sitting down our server walked over with a chalkboard full of specials.  The specials started at raw foods and culminated in the cooked meats.I asked the server if we could order the omakase menu.  She told me that normally the chef likes a few days notice for that, but she would ask him.  Well lucky for us, the chef said yes, and for $50 each, we began our journey through some of the most exciting tastes and textures I've had since moving to Las Vegas.I came prepared, ready to snap photos of everything we ate and write down the main components of each dish.  As soon as the first plate came, I scrapped that plan, and decided to just fully immerse myself in the wonderful experience.  We were served many things, and I cannot do them all the justice they deserve in this review, so I will focus on my three favorite items:Fresh Water Mackeral Sashimi - Completely raw, not cured in salt of Kombu.  The mackeral was regally delicate, with a shimmering silver skin.  The dim lights in the restaurant illuminated the fish like a spotlight from the sky.  Crispy Mackeral - The skin and bones from the mackarel we ate sashimi from were served.  LIght and crispy, I could have snacked on this on the couch while watching Jeopardy!  I loved being able to enjoy the whole fish, and appreciate the chef's attention to both the complexity of flavors, and sustainable food practice.  Braised Abalone - served with daikon radish and an elegant sea weed broth.  Each bite was an explosion of new flavors, I felt like I new taste buds were sprouting up on my tongue especially for this dish.  Not to offend, but it was like losing your virginity, only less awkward afterwards.  Raku is one of those must-haves for the appreciative eater.  Each dish will be brought out along with recommendations of how to fully enjoy all the flavors.  This is magnificent meal, reservations are a must.  Can't take a trip to Japan, allow your tongue to experience what the rest of you cannot.I'm stoked that my 100th review will be for such a great restaurant!I have been wanting to try Raku ever since I heard about it. The first couple times we tried to go, we called that day and they were booked until way past my bedtime. So we decided to plan ahead and made reservations a couple of weeks in advance. I wanted to make sure and try the best items so when we made our reservations, I requested the $75 omakase dinner. For our first course we had the sashimi salad. This was one of my favorites of the night. It came with 2 dressings, one spicy and one sweet. The fish was high quality. The crisp onions on top provided a nice flavor and textural contrast. It was a lovely way to start our meal.Next we were served Raku's tofu. They make their own tofu and it comes with bonito, green onion, and ginger. The waitress suggested using the green tea salt and soy sauce to season it as well. The soy sauce is homemade and has a slightly sweet flavor. The tofu had a creamy, smooth texture. I never imagined imagined eating plain tofu and liking it, but I did.For our third course we had Agedashi tofu which was deep fried tofu in a miso broth topped with salmon roe. It was exceptional. This was another of my favorites of the night. I don't know how they make tofu so delicious!Next up was grilled tomatoes. They had a nice charcoal grill flavor.Course 5 was juicy deep fried chicken. It was served on a bed of spinach and had awesome crispy skin with sesame. It was indeed juicy and very tasty.We then had asparagus with bacon. It consisted of 3 small spears of asparagus wrapped in bacon. The bacon had a nice smoky grilled flavor.Our seventh course was butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce. The scallop was nicely cooked and the sweet soy sauce complemented the dish nicely. This was in my wife's top three dishes.Our next dish was yellowtail with glazed soy-based sauce. It was served with minced radish. The radish made the dish go from good to great. It was a perfect pairing.Next up was chicken wrapped with skin. It was salty and was a great contrast to the previous slightly sweet courses. The skin was sinfully good.We then were served Kurobuta pork cheek. It was chewy and reminded me of steak fat. That might not sound appetizing, but it was really good.For our 11th course we had Kobe beef outside skirt with garlic. My wife loved how the garlic chips complemented by the beef. I liked it too, but by this time I was getting full.Next was another of my favorites, steamed foie gras egg custard. The custard was beautifully cooked. It was served in a delicious broth. Though I was getting full by now, I couldn't stop eating it.After that we were served Tsukune grilled ground chicken. It looked like a chicken sausage. I was stuffed so I only ate a bite and took the rest home.We then were given grilled rice balls. One was flavored with soy sauce and the other with miso. I only had a bite and packed the rest.Lastly, we were given two desserts. First up was green tea creme brûlée. The green tea ice cream was subtly flavored and just slightly sweet. It was a nice balance to creme brûlée.Our other dessert was cheesecake. It had raspberries hidden inside. I love raspberries, and when I ate the raspberry sitting on top of the cheesecake I exclaimed, "That's a nice raspberry!"  The cheesecake was fluffy and airy. It was served with a delicious raspberry sauce and green tea salt.Playing in the background was Japanese elevator music, including a rendition of Michael Jackson's "Beat It" which was pretty neat.The bathroom has artificial grass on the floor, a fake tree growing up the wall, foliage on the ceiling, birds playing in the background, and flower petals on the floor. A must see!The meal was definitely delicious, but I think we should have gone with a $50 omakase meal as there were about five too many courses. I well definitely go back! Can't wait to try my favorites again and sample some new dishes!Time for an update!  Since my last review I've been to the sake tasting and had the Kaiseki menu. First, the sake tasting.  This happened back in February.  $45 for AYCE Raku food PLUS all the sake and Sapporo you can drink!  All the tables are reorganized for a cocktail-type service.  The food is freshly cooked and is served at the bar buffet style in the front of the restaurant.  Small servings of tofu, various skewers of meat from the Robata grill, asparagus wrapped in bacon, all the good stuff.  The staff just keeps cooking and bringing food out.  It was from 10pm to 2am, which is not the best time for me, but it was worth it!  Not too crowded.  We made a reservation but they accepted walk-ins too.  People come and go as they please so that helps.  The sake servers are really knowledgeable.  I learned a lot.  I really, really hope they do this again but I have not seen another announcement for this since the last one in February.  Such a good deal and so much fun, too!Second, I had the 15-course Kaiseki menu earlier this month.  This is not for the faint of heart or those who are in a hurry.  It's $150 per person and they need at least 3 days notice.  You need to make a reservation and they take your credit card number because they actually start preparing your meal 3 days in advance!  The website says it takes about 3 hours to complete.  Ours took around 3.5 hours.  It was an awesome experience!  The menu changes each time but here are some of the highlights: homemade tofu served with roe, sashimi, foie gras custard, a sampling of their appetizers including deep fried chicken and crispy asparagus, steak and garlic cooked on a really hot stone, and fluffy cheesecake.  I've downloaded pics if you are interested.  Definitely come hungry.  I didn't eat all day.  There is also a $100 10-course menu.This is my favorite restaurant in all of Las Vegas.  Once I get off my stupid diet, I'm going here.Never did I think that the words "tofu" and "mouthwatering" would ever be used in the same sentence. Although I've had different versions of Japanese food before, Raku takes the prize hands down. Hidden in a strip mall way away from all the casinos and bright lights, Raku prefers to keep it understated. The restaurant only has about 10-12 tables along with a small room for groups near the back. I'd suggest calling ahead for a reservation, but since they stay open so late (someone tells me 3 a.m.?), chances are you'll be seated eventually. If you've never had traditional Japanese food before, the menu is pretty overwhelming. I was lucky enough to dine here with a local and he did all of the ordering. Good thing, too, because I had no idea where to start. We definitely had the tofu (get it! so good!) and a myriad of small plates, including scallops and salmon- two fish that I normally turn my nose up at, but were SO good! These chefs know their sauces. That's all I have to say about that...Go here with someone (or a few someones) that you really like, order yourselves a ton of food and plan on "oohing" and "aahing" the entire time.If you haven't spoken to someone who has dined here, you won't know about this place. Its tiny and located in a very run-down unassuming strip mall on Spring Mountain. You would never guess that such delicious and fine Japanese cuisine comes out of this place!I've eaten here a few times and I will continue to return. The style of their dishes is similar to izakaya. Lots of small dishes and be sure to order some sake cocktails. The waitress will bring over a specials board which is changed quite frequently. I will tell you that the most delicious items I've eaten have been off this menu. But BEWARE: this board will draw you in but most if not all items are upwards of $20 close to $30.You can't order a bad thing on the menu. However, there is so much variety. If you're not familiar with Japanese dining, you might be a bit intimidated. The waitresses are very sweet. At times it might be difficult to communicate through their Japanese accents but they're always delighted to answer any questions.Happy Eating! And be sure to make a reservation or you'll never get to try this place. It gets packed quick.Finally had the opportunity to bust my Raku cherry with three friends visiting from out of town, and when you have a group of folks walk in with no appetite from a heavy late lunch and still managed to complete a meal with their taste buds completely blown away, it is clearly a sign of just pure amazing food.  We had a taste of a few items from each section (appetizers, robata grill, and noodles/rice/soups), and can hardly wait to return for more.  I was so inspired that I composed a Raku Haiku for each of our selections:"Sashimi Salad"Fresh slice of the seaDeep-fried onions paired with greensPerfect start to meal"Agedashi Tofu"House made soybean dreamAmazing broth, chili, roeTen dollars well spent"Apple Marinated Lamb Chop"Succulent two chopsAromatically juicyNo shame to gnaw bone"Soboro Don- Seasoned Ground Chicken"Quail yolk atop riceMix ingredients and shareComfort food at its best"Grilled rice ball"Two nuggets of artFragrant mint countervailed with crunchComplements all meats"Asparagus"Crispy rice coatingPerfect balance in textureVeggie laced with crack"Kobe beef skirt steak"Ribeye pales to youWhere have you been all my life?Melt in your mouth joy"Pork Cheek"Bacon's lost cousinI feel guilty eating this...Yet I cannot stopThe chefs of today may well be the Van Goghs of our time. The care and precision of modern food presentation has made some of the creations on our plates incredible edible works of art.The Japanese have the art of food presentation imbued in their food culture and they really put their heart and soul into making their food a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.On my visit to Las Vegas last September, I was starting to feel a bit jaded about eating at the big corporate named restaurants on the strip and sought out a dinner spot more in keeping with being a locals' favourite. A Yelp search threw up Raku and a quick check with local Yelp friend Emily R confirmed that it was one of her favourite spots in town.I was especially drawn to their kaiseki menu, where they create a unique menu based on the best ingredients available that day. A quick phone call secured  my dinner reservation and as requested on their website, I pre-ordered the kaiseki menu.My taxi dropped outside Raku, which is located in a non-descipt small off-Strip mall. Any initial fears about the unprepossessing surroundings were soon dispelled by the warm welcome I received on entering the restaurant. There was a general hubbub of conviviality in the restaurant all evening with many customers obviously being happy regulars.I bagged a seat at my favourite place to sit in a restaurant - at the counter watching the chefs at work. I was able to chat to the main chef all evening, who was very happy to engage and explain things to me about my unfolding gastronomic adventure.Every dish was a work of art and there were quite a few new flavours for my palate to savour.1. Mountain potato croquettes in dashi broth2. Eight mini treasures, including creations such as tofu skin with wasabi and egg with sashimi3. The house signature homemade silken tofu with salmon roe and homemade green tea salt and soya sauce4. Fluke sashimi and liver with spring radish and grated onion dipped in ponzu sauce5. Japanese/Spanish mackarel marinated in yuzu6. Foie gras/egg custard/summer truffle served in an egg shell7. Eel with shisho pepper8. Uni with egg9. Kobe beef on hot rock flamed with Hennessy XO sauce10. Mixed tuna over rice11. Panna cotaAs you can see, the list of ingredients is like a who's who of the best ingredients to pass one's lips. Everything was a delight to eat. I love the way that Japanese cookery has given exquisite food presentation to the west but in return, the has given them ingredients like foie gras to cook with.Service was always with a smile all evening.The final touch of class came at the end of my meal when the chef confessed that normally, they don't do the kaiseki menu for only one person due to the large amount of prep time involved but as I was visiting from London, they made an exception.Arigato, Aburiya Raku!I ate at Raku by a friend's recommendation (thanks Julie K and Bobby L. for driving).  Whenever I go to Vegas, I rarely have the opportunity to head to Chinatown \ Spring Valley so this was a nice surprise.  Back at home in the Bay Area, I've eaten at a fair amount of Izakaya joints but I must say that Raku really blew me away!Unfortunately I can't remember a few dishes that I took pics of because were had ordered them from their Specials Board.  Just let the pics explain themselves.Here are the highlights:Raku's Tofu(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=vKeXGJldbsQM01iXXVwoSA)Right off the bat, their Tofu blew me away.  And we're talking about plain no-frills house-made tofu.  We thought it was so good that we ordered another plate of it!  Blue Fin Tuna(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=CkPFeK_AAvYzPAb3DKuAuQ#CkPFeK_AAvYzPAb3DKuAuQ)Very fresh!Enoki Mushrooms(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=GkrGZds3BHOoC-5mvKKIVg)This was a good appetizer before the meat dishes started to arriveSalmon Belly (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=IHbcDOAdYFyN0CYIkkpSpw#IHbcDOAdYFyN0CYIkkpSpw)Very tasty!!Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=gpHaJuO8n-WQ_1LfnYSidw#gpHaJuO8n-WQ_1LfnYSidw)This one was okay but didn't really do much for me.Kurobuta Pork Cheek(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=tzjYja7zbBreFMGNT-Be9w)Same thing goes for the pork cheek.  This was actually quite tough and required a lot of chewing.Burger Special (Forgot the name)(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=IHbcDOAdYFyN0CYIkkpSpw#IHbcDOAdYFyN0CYIkkpSpw)If you know me, then you know I love Japanese Hamburger Steaks.  I just love it when you cut them open and a whole pocket of steam just erupts from it.  I really like this dish.  It was a pretty good meat combo with beef and pork and the sauce when well with it.Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=GKzNDSHfkTVf1_7JujeJ2w#GKzNDSHfkTVf1_7JujeJ2w)If there's one thing that can top the burger, it's these Kobe Beef sticks.  Very flavorful and cooked very good!Foie Gras with Glazed Soy-base Sauce(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A?select=P7GZFWsN7vuNJin6ZiVzqQ)And if there's one thing that can top the Kobe Beef and basically everything in the menu, it's this Foie Gras stick.  The Soy-base Sauce just made it heavenly!I would definitely come back again here for another visit.  The food was excellent and the service was spot on.  And for all that we ordered, the split bill still came down to $37 a person with tax and tip.  Can't really ask for anything more.  After eating their food, it was quite obvious whey Raku is such a hot spot for foodies and local and celebrity chefs.Seriously good  Japanese comfort food (robata grill) combined with outstanding artistry.For starters, agedashi tofu.  Sublime; fried house made tofu bathed in a heavenly flavored dashi base topped with briny salmon roe.From the robata grill, Kurobuta pork cheeks (face, not butt, sweet porky goodness),  enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon (smoky richness), "Kobe" fillet with wasabi (tender, wasabi brings out a mineral earthiness and sweetness), "Kobe" skirt with garlic (razor thin slivers of garlic mixes with melting beef fat), and if they have it, teriyaki foie (orgasmic flavor explosion that goes on and on).Finally, the kaiseki meals are incredible.  They feature small portions of the best of the robata grill mixed with delicacies not offered anywhere else on the menu.  Some of the dishes are out there.  One night offered sea snails another foie chawanmushi.  Both surprisingly delicious.  Keep an open mind.  The progression of courses in flavors, textures, and temperature is well thought out.  Well worth the $100 or $150.  Note:  three day advance reservations required for the kaiseki and all members of your group need to order it.Tip:  always ask if there are any off the menu specials.  Depending on how much they "like" you, you may be in for a real treat (sorry, it's an Asian thing).Good selection of sake at all quality and price levels. Needless to say, highly recommended.There are certain times in life when food takes center stage.Ladies, and Gents...Raku is beyond that.I popped in on a whim the other night. Countless coworkers would tell me about how this was the BEST restaurant in all of Las Vegas. I took it for granted, because people always say that about one restaurant or another. I guess I had to experience it for myself.A friend and I stopped in without a reservation last week. It's a small restaurant and each of the tables (but one) was occupied. The dining room is small. It may remind you of the dining scene in San Francisco or New York City. The kind of place that begs for your attention through it's subtle exterior.After a short wait, we were seated at a nice table.We ordered:-Agadashi Tofu -- So perfect and so good!-House Tofu -- Also amazing. Next time I'd probably get half and half with Agadashi.-Black Cod -- Better than Nobu. This was off the seasonal Fish menu.-Crispy Asparagus -- Perfectly cooked, crunchy, crispy delicious.-Fried Shrimp -- Delicious. These are full shrimp. Don't get grossed out by the shrimp heads.-Green Tea Creme Brulee -- The perfect ending to a fantastic meal.Your table will have some seasonings on it. A green tea salt. A chili powder. A sake chili thing. And soy sauce which is incredible and seasoned with plum. Use these seasonings. Mix and match. They tend to provide a different experience with each mixture.This one meal is a Top Five for me. I'm no stranger to food, and good food at that. This is the spot that is a MUST TRY when you are in Vegas.Total Bill for Two -- About 60 bucks.Return Timetable: Immediate.This is Part II of my Japanese Double Dinner in Vegas.Second stop: RakuSo after my first dinner at Trattoria Nakamura-Ya in Part I (http://bit.ly/WueK9g), I had my second dinner with my friends at Raku just a few doors down!This was my second visit to Raku and I must say it was even better than the first!! Being from California, we came here with one mission.  Order hella foie gras!!!Well we came and we conquered!!Raku Tofuhttp://bit.ly/WcmXzaThis is a must order every time you come here!  It's so creamy.  You can tell they take a lot of pride in their tofu making craftEnoki Mushroomshttp://bit.ly/WpawPX (Pic from my last visit)When I go to any izakaya house, this is always a default order for me.  Especially since it's wrapped in bacon!!  Raku's is nicely done!!Yellowtail Carpacciohttp://bit.ly/VkP0ugVery fresh and tasty Yellowtail!Negitoro Specialhttp://bit.ly/WLd2OxFatty Tuna Belly at it's finest! Foie Gras Custardhttp://bit.ly/118rMwADon't know what to say about this one.  Very cold, but who cares, it's freaking Foie Gras!!!Kobe Beef with Garlic Skewershttp://bit.ly/WpaIyB (Pic from my last visit)Mmm.....Kobe Beef!!!  This was the a great lead in to the finale.....Foie Gras Skewers for the Table!!!http://bit.ly/VkkoqZOH MAN!!!  Food porn galore!  Here's a close up of this indulgence skewered on two sticks(http://bit.ly/WudzGP).  Oh yeah!  I loved how they saved the best for last!Green Tea Creme Bruleehttp://bit.ly/VOpiOYOkay so it wasn't entirely the last dish.  We did have dessert and while it wasn't Foie Gras, it was a very refreshing Green Tea Creme Brulee with Green Tea Ice Cream.What can I say?  Raku is amazing!  Even in the bay area, I don't think there's another izakaya restaurant that can compare to it.  I'll definitely be back again soon!Overall: 4.5 starsFood presentation is awesome here.Sashimi salad- very fresh & light 10 ptsPoached egg w sea urchin - very interesting texture kinda slimy but sea tasting.  Uni doesnt overwhelm the rest of the items in the dish. 9 ptsButter scallop - so yummy & delicate. 10 ptsBaby seabass- not as soft as I expected it 2b. Too many bones, was so disappointed in this dish.  Not worth $25 price tag  2 ptsFried agadashi tofu very yummy tender & tasty 9.9 ptsGreen tea creme brulee - perfect combo of flavors. green tea ice cream just seals the deal here. Great way to finish off dinner. 11 ptsThey charge for tea here... =(Service can be a bit slow here.It's taken me a LONG time to getting around to this review, but I needed to dedicate time to properly raving about this wonderful meal. I visited on 04/11/2013 with my fiance Ruben and our cousin Daisy (visiting from the Bay Area). We were sat in a private dining area and it was so cool and intimate. I was really glad I made that reservation a couple months in advance!We tried the Raku's Tofu: Housemade tofu that was super silky served with fresh grated ginger, green onions, and Katsuoboshi. Then topped with some of Raku's Soy Sauce (Japanese Daijingo soy sauce blended with Japanese plum). Simple and tasty. Also, the Agedashi Tofu: Their housemade tofu lightly fried and presented in a bowl of warm dashi broth and topped with green onions, Ikura, and nori. And for an extra kick, some hot chili paste placed on the rim of your bowl. Really, really great. I'm a big fan of tofu so I could be happy eating Raku's Tofu all night, but this Agedashi Tofu is a party of flavors in your mouth.We also tried the Tempura Asparagus, Kanpachi sashimi (special), Blue Fin Tuna sashimi (special), Salmon with Ikura Oroshi, Enoki Mushroom Wrapped in Bacon, Direct-Flamed Eggplant (served with Katsuoboshi), Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce, Kobe Beef Filet with Wasabi, Apple Marinated Lamb Chop, Grilled Rice Balls, Yellowtail with Glazed Soy-based Sauce, and Juicy Deep Fried Chicken. Their Yuzu Sake is really delicious.My favorites were the tofu dishes, the sashimi specials, Enoki Mushroom with Bacon (this was SO good, we ordered it twice), and Apple Marinated Lamp Chop (we ordered two of these as well).Our meal was spectacular. We had so much fun with all the dishes and the service was wonderful. There are so many selections and everything was, at the least exciting, and at the best, amazing. I would compare the experience to enjoying tapas with great friends. Same idea with sharing small plates and that's just always a blast in my book. The food was wonderful, I seriously can't wait to go back and try some of their other amazing concoctions!In a city where I've had subpar Asian eats, my experiences at Raku has been on another level. When it was first recommended to me, I expected it to be part of the Strip like any other high end eatery, and one that was in the confines of a casino resort. Instead, it is a Japanese establishment in the splendors of Chinatown.My expectations were surprisingly low the first time around. I haven't had incredible experiences of the Japanese kind in Vegas just yet, plus I was less likely to put faith in a place that was more Asian fusion than pure Japanese as Raku seems to be. And in the seediness of Chinatown no less? I was already beginning to doubt its $$$$ rating.But thankfully, my expectations were not only met but exceeded in every way. Everything was truly spectacular, from the small plates to the entrees and it was hard to pass up anything considering how fresh and tasty it all was. Stars of the initial evening were bold cuts of sashimi, namely blue fin tuna, coupled by an incredible array of tofu dishes and one dish that would make any seafood lover salivate: fresh uni with salmon roe, topped off by a perfectly poached egg.It has been several visits since then and all is right with the world. Client dinners have been nothing short of amazing and my personal escapades have resulted in a lot of experimentation with the menu. I've become enamored with a live uni udon, their daily blue crab miso soup, and their array of skewered meats. Kobe beef, chicken skin, and pork cheek have been favorites in all izakaya circles.The service, ambiance, and overall visits have been excellent to the T. Las Vegas is lucky to be home to so many wonderful establishments, but Raku is certainly one of their shiniest gems in the desert. 5 Stars and nothing less.Raku is one of my favorite restaurants for a number of reasons.  Great things happen when I eat here and the food is excellent. To celebrate a special occasion, I went here. We were considering getting the omakase for $100/person but that's like a lottery - you don't know what items you'll get. Although I've never had anything I didn't like from this place, we had specific things we wanted to try. My faves:Kobe Beef Filet with Wasabi, Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic, Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce, Foie Gras with Glazed Soy-base Sauce, Asparagus with Bacon, Enoki Mushroom Wrapped with Bacon and Green Tea Creme Brulee. I love their blue fin sashimi but we didn't order that this time.Aside from my faves, we also tried Raku's homemade tofu, juicy deep-fried chicken, steamed foie gras egg custard, chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin, kobe beef silver skin, Iberico pork and kanpachi kama.Homemade Tofu:Can be ordered in half or full portions. Comes with ginger, green onions and bonito. The texture of the tofu is so different from all the tofu I've ever had. It has the consistency of formed cottage cheese. 4.5/5Juicy Deep-Fried Chicken:Crispy skin, juicy fatty chicken. Absolutely delicious! 5/5Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard:This dish has the same broth as in agedashi tofu. This chawanmushi has a mild foie gras taste to it and has a piece of duck on top. 5/5Chicken Breast Wrapped with Chicken Skin:Slightly crisp chicken skin seasoned with salt. For some reason, I really liked the simplicity of this dish. 5/5Kobe Beef Silver Skin:A bit oily and sweet. This is the skin of a cow put on a skewer and grilled. 4/5Iberico Pork:I love jamon Iberico and I was thinking this would be similar. But this is actual chunks of pork with a yummy sauce and grilled. 5/5Kanpachi Kama:Perfectly grilled amberjack collar with a nice ponzu/soy dipping sauce. Although I was not in the mood for fish, I still think this is the best kama in town. Very meaty, moist (terrible word) and perfectly cooked. 5/5Although the last time we went here, they didn't have 2 items we wanted: Poached Egg w/ Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe and, Hamachi Kama. They also changed their decor. They replaced Hello Kitty with a pig with a big mouth - creepy looking mofo! I'd still come back here regardless...Small tiny place that you have to make reservations for WAY in advance. My mom made a reservation for us 2 weeks in advance, and if you're late..within 15 minutes they will give your table to somebody else. Located in a small tiny corner in Chinatown. We got there about 10 minutes before our reservation time, but we were assisted to sit down right away. The food itself takes quite a long time to arrive. We were there for almost 2 hours. It took about a good 45 minutes for the first plate to come out. I actually prefer Shin Sen Gumi Yakitori over this place. The taste isn't as strong as theirs. But, overall it's pretty good. Popeye salad $8- Spinach and bacon (mainly), decently good. A little too salty, but a good salad nonetheless!Asparagus Okaki $5- DELICIOUS. Super crunchy, and it actually tasty cheesy! Nom nom. Juicy Fried Chicken $9- Not a favorite. Didn't have too much flavor to it, and it was strangely chewy. Slightly warm as well. Ice Fish $8.50- Frowning as I write this. I don't like fish, and I don't like seeing multiple tiny fishes fried up whole. I ate like 3.. D: no gusta.Agedashi Tofu $11- Pretty good! I just didn't like the fish eggs inside, but overall it was a good and flavored dish!Momo chicken thigh $2.75 each- Err, it was a little too pink for my liking, and it was kind of fatty. It was okay Tsukune $3.50 each- Shin Sen's is much tastier. This one comes as like a drumstick, and I had to keep adding more togarashi. Not enough sauce. Harami Kobe Beef skirt $7.50 each- Delicious! Comes with grunchy garlic chips. Mmm, super tasty!Yakionigiri $5.00 (comes with 2)- It was..okay. LolScallop with soy sauce $7.00- Not sure how this tasted. Didn't eat this one!Asparagus with Bacon $3.00- Comes with 3 pieces, pretty good. Asahi $7.00Umeshu $12.00 (super delicious!)Overall, the flavor was almost there, and I didn't think it was the greatest.Since my initial visit during their first year opened, I've been back a handful of times and felt it was time I updated my review.  Raku is the kind of place we usually reserve for special occasions and recommend to out of town guests.  Our most recent visit was only last week as the Husband and I celebrated our five year wedding anniversary.We attempted to make reservations on the same day and the only opening they had was at 9:00 pm.  We did a walk in to hopefully land a cancellation spot or two of the coveted five counter seats, and it was only a 30 minute wait for the counter seats!  Sweet!  But yes, make reservations way in advance, especially if you have a larger party or it's a weekend.The thing to look out for is the Specials Board.  They usually list about 5-6 items on there that range from raw to cooked items.  The weirdest part about this board is that it will change during your visit there.  During our 2-3 hour dinner, we saw some things sell out and get replaced with something else.  The waitstaff doesn't mention the newer items, so it's something you just have to look out for.  (For example, oysters were not listed on the specials board but the party sitting next to us ended up ordering the last giant oyster.  They were seated after us and only knew about it because the oyster was sitting on ice right in front of them!  They had squid on ice too, but it wasn't listed on the specials board!)  So, not only are you keeping your eyes out for the changing Specials Board but you have to see what's fresh and on ice that day!  We do get a few cooked items and although they are good, the raw fish choices are always the best!These days we skip the Robata Grill items, not because they aren't tasty but we like to focus on the more unique items.  One of our most favorite items is the Crispy Asparagus Okaki ($5).  It's a simple asparagus that's been dredged in rice crackers and deep-fried.  I don't know why it's so good but it just is.  And when you add a little of their matcha salt, oh my gawd!  I just love it.Another item we had on this last visit include the Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard ($10).  There's a piece of duck that lays on top of this dish, and it's actually duck liver they use, not goose.  The foie gras is already mixed in with the egg, so it gives the whole dish a rich egg taste.  Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe ($9) is another unusual pairing, mostly because of the mountain yam that gives this dish a slimy texture.  You break up the egg and mix it all together, but you can't help but notice the slimy effect from the mountain yam.  It's a tasty nonetheless.  The Kobe Beef Liver Sashimi ($9.50) is something that not everyone would enjoy.  The Husband isn't usually a fan of liver, except served foie gras style, but he was game.  And it did still lend a livery taste, but it's something that you have to try once.I always enjoy homemade tofu and Raku's Tofu (Whole $5.50) does not disappoint.  They server theirs with bonito shavings, ginger, and scallions.The four condiments placed on every table should not go ignored, especially the green tea salt and their own soy sauce.  Yum!Since they expanded, their bathrooms are indeed something to look at.  First off, it's so clean and pristine and holds one of the cleanest fish tanks you'll ever see on Spring Mountain! Service on our last few visits have been much better compared to my first visit.  The waitress that took care of us at the counter never let my water glass go empty and she was always letting us know when our food was coming so we weren't waiting too long and giving us clean plates too.My only real gripe was this: Although I usually love sitting at the counter so I can watch the chefs at work, I also can't overlook things that probably shouldn't be seen by dining guests.  One of the prep guys at the counter sneezed into his hands and continued prepping the food.  I was totally turned off by this, especially because there was a sink right behind him.  It wasn't too long after when the Husband said to me that we weren't going to be ordering anymore cold foods.  When I inquired as to why, he said he noticed the same prep guy just cough into his hands and continue working.  Yes, a sneeze and cough into the very bare hands that were prepping the food.  Yuck.Nonetheless, we still do love Raku and would continue recommending it.  But alas, those basic hygiene issues need to be addressed!  4.5 stars.My third visit to Raku was a completely different experience than my last two visits in that this was my first time coming here solo.  Because of this, I wasn't able to order as much food since I had no one to share around.  However, from what I ordered during this trip, it was plenty enough to still impress and satisfy me.Agedashi Tofu -- http://bit.ly/1faVKnuThe first two times I visited I had tried their housemade Raku Tofu and had been amazed by it both times.  So this time I ordered it Agedashi style because for one thing, it looks awesome in the photos, and the other is that everything is elevated to awesomer status when it's deep fried.Foie Gras Egg Custard -- http://bit.ly/1h53VDeYou didn't think I was gonna leave Raku, or all of Vegas, without getting my Foie Gras fix since it's banned in my home state of CA.  I had this dish last time I went to Raku, but the big difference with this visit is that I got to have this all to myself......bwahahahah!Wagyu Sukiyaki -- http://bit.ly/IIHIyXThis was on the No.1 item on the top of their Specials board.  That meant that they wanted you to order it!  Like most of the items on the board there is no price listed so you know you're gonna fork up the dollars.  I've never had Grade A5 Wagyu before so this was my splurge of my entire trip.The Sukiyaki is cooked right in front of you on top of a bed of their special smoke free charcoal (http://bit.ly/IIHCaz).  Took about 5 mins to cook.There's a lot going on with this pot, first you have the A5 Wagyu on top, and underneath all that goodness, you have the housemade Raku Tofu with clear noodles and veggies.  The trippy part for me was that they give you a raw egg in a small bowl with which you must crack and beat to use for dipping sauce for the beef.  This may be sensitive to some folks, but I had good faith in their product so I went with it and it actually went well with the Wagyu Beef.  The only minor caveat I had with this dish was that the sukiyaki broth was a little too much on the sweet side.  But that is a really minor complaint because I totally enjoyed this dish.  At $45, for probably the most expensive Sukiyaki I've ever had, it was worth every penny!!Raku has done it again to impress me with their top notch service and incredible food.  It has shown me that whether you come in with a group or dine in solo, you'll have an awesome experience no matter what!!  I'll be back again soon!!!As someone who was born and raised in Japan, I can safely assure you that Raku is absolutely the most authentic, the best Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas.Before moving to Vegas, I had lived for 8 years in San Francisco Bay Area, and there were great Japanese restaurants, but few match Raku.Although on the high end, the prices aren't crazy expensive either, I'd say it's reasonable for the quality.I'm very surprised that most of Japanese restaurants on the Strip are mere gewgaws, full of upscale looking gimmicks, but I won't complain because we have Raku!Located way off the strip in an unassuming shopping center, you'd probably miss this restaurant if you blinked. Luckily, the stellar reviews made in part by my fellow Yelpers piqued my interest in finding this elusive favorite. Now locating the place is a challenge in itself but landing a reservation is equally exhausting!As fate would have it, I landed a 9pm dining reservation. Woot! Little did I know, however, that a reservation merely meant when you arrived, you'd be relegated to waiting an additional 10-15minutes for your seat. That being said, I took the opportunity to park it at the sidebar to glance over the extensive menu while guzzling down a bottle of Asahi with shots of chilled nigori. Honestly, by the time I was seated, I was about three sheets to the wind! I know, I'm a cheap date.Now onto the food shall we?I went with the server's recommendations as well as my seasoned Yelp buddies' choices who've had successful dining experiences here previously...Negitoro Blue Fin 35$ fresh and buttery slices of blue fin tuna with a cast of delectable condiments that left my taste buds doing a happy dance! Trust me, the experience is virtually umami x 10! Wagyu Sashimi 20$ - thinly sliced filets of premium rare wagyu beef with a hint of wasabi on top and accompanied with a special savory soy dipping sauce. The first bite was like velvet on my tongue and the mouthfeel was literally like butter melting in my mouth. Superb!Agedashi tofu 7.50$ 1/2 order -a delightful dish with compelling flavors and an irresistibly soft texture that had me pining for more Butter sautéed scallop 7$ x2 - my favorite dish of the evening. The butter poached scallops were soft and supple with an incredibly mouthwatering garlicky flavor and fluffy texture. Absolutely amazing!Enoki Mushroom & Bacon 3$ x2 come on now, we know everything tastes better with bacon and this was no exception. Just order it and thank me later.Chicken wrapped chicken skin 3x2 -tender chunks of chicken breast wrapped in succulent chicken skin. An indulgent  experience that is second to none Poached Egg with Sea Urchin & Salmon Roe full cast of delectable ingredients that left my taste buds in a tailspin of delight. Intriguing enjoyable and texturally fascinating! Other notable dishes included:Kobe Garlic Skirt 7.50 x2Kurobuta Pork Cheek 4.25$ x2Foie gras egg custard 10Duck in balsamic 4.50$ x2Iberico Pork 10 x2Nigori 40$ well worth it! IMO I bought 2 bottles :)All in all, I had a great dining experience at Raku and it's safe to say I'd gladly return to enjoy their enticing small plates again and, of course, to imbibe in their spirits!Happy Eats!Dear Raku,Thank you for providing great food and giving my friend a great smile. Having known my friend for more than two years, I have never seen her so happy before. This speaks a lot to your well-executed, high-quality food. My friend was amazed by the grilled salmon belly. According to her, the salmon skin was as crispy as a piece of bacon. The belly meat was fresh and smooth. She rated the salmon belly 9 out of 10, the highest rating that she had given to any dish yet. Foie gras Yakitori was my friend's second favorite dish at your restaurant. She loved the deep flavor and the creamy texture of the foie gras. If the cholesterol of foie gras was not high, she would have ordered another piece. Her only disappointment at Raku was that some pieces of the Kobe beef liver were slightly overcooked and tough. Raku, you not only made my friend happy, but you also made me felt satisfied with my food. I adored the different sauces, spices and side ingredients that are used for Raku's tofu. The various combinations of ginger, soy sauce, sea salt, and green onion made me felt as if I had three different tofu dishes. I wish my grilled eggplant was more flavorful - I had to add an extensive amount of shichimi, green tea sea salt, soy sauce and katsuobushi to enhance the flavor of the eggplant. Nonetheless, I was impressed by the creamy texture of the eggplant. My friend and I decided to give you four stars instead of five stars because neither of us was able to reach the host when we tried to make reservations via the phone. We ended up waiting in front of the restaurant forty minutes in advance, and luckily became the first customers of the day. Raku, you are awesome. Keep up the good work!Yours,MayWOWWWW cooking at it's finest. This place gets rave reviews for a reason. top notch high quality cuisine. Best tofu I've ever had! It's the freshest period! I've never had tofu that tastes like this. Literally melted in my mouth. I ate here off a recommendation from a chef out in my hometown. He said he drove out here just to eat and drove home literally after. I had to make my way here. Foie gras custard ... omg! melting like no other in my mouth! Both tofu dishes - best tofu I've ever had! Recommendation: The entire menu!Raku is consistently great!  It is easily one of my favorites in town!As a kid I practice Judu. I had a Sensei that used to say "spread the spirit of nurturing rightness." I had no idea what he meant then and I'm still trying to figure it out now. I do know that Raku is doing a lot right when it comes to incredibly delicious dishes!...they are probably ahead of me in spreading the spirit of nurturing rightness. I'm okay with that, but if you haven't shared in this experience you might want to get in on what they're nurturing over there because it is downright scrumptious!Some of the standards that we usually go with include:Udon Noodle with Foie Gras Egg Custard Soup (I adore this...one of those items you crave days later)Cold Green Tea Soba with Poarched EggKurobuta Pork CheekDuck with Balsamic Soy SauceYellowtail CarpaccioSteamed Foie Gras Egg CustardFish BellyI also really appreciate the following:Agedashi TofuKen² SaladKobe Beef Fillet with WasabiKobe Beef Outside Skirt with GarlicButter Sautéed Scallop with Soy SauceAnd for us, no visit would be complete with a few orders of their skewered veggies & mushrooms...you can get them wrapped in bacon, but they are beautiful on their own.Dessert offers some excellent options, including Melting Chocolate Cake and Green Tea Crème Brulée...but if you've taken the time to come here why not spend a little more time in the same shopping center and go to Sweets Raku for a complete experience?...unless you ate too much at Raku of course. Oh, and speaking of complete experiences, you can always opt to partake in one of their Omakase options that go for $75 or $100 per person.Be sure to check out the special board for some truly pleasing selections...these will typically run you a little more, but are often incredible.  There are places I like as much as Raku, but not many that I like more for my money...it is easy in this town to spend two or three times as much for the same quality and execution of food. In fact I'm not sure I'd argue with someone that said Raku is the best for the money in Vegas.Come here...make some reservations first, but come here!Items Selected:Red Sea Breem (Renko Dai) - Sashimi with pickled chrysanthemum, glass noodles, crispy skinJuicy Deep Fried Asajimie Chicken with Spinach and YuzuCrispy Pig's EarKurobuta Pork Belly in Broth with Braised Greens1/2 Agadashi Tofu with Ikura, Mushroom DashiYellowtail Belly with Ponzu and DaikonRed Sea Breem (Renko Dai) - Fried, in Mushroom DashiSteamed Foie Gras Egg CustardApple Cider Lamb ChopPork CheekDuck with Balsamic SoyGreen Tea Soba with Poached EggHot TeaNot visited since 2009, when visiting as a tourist and unadvisedly walking from-and-back-to The Strip, it was finally at the close of 2014 that a return visit to Raku was planned and although three visits to its Sweets sister just down the way have proven universally stellar over the past 18 months a walk-in seat in one of the expanded private rooms proved a slightly less than ideal experience, the service almost non-existent for the first fourty-five minutes while a few of the plates lacked the luster some would suggest overrides every single thing on Mitsuo Endo's somewhat stagnant menu.Undoubtedly the most upscale Izakaya...or Aburiya...in a city where the genre has expanded substantially since Raku opened its doors it was in a small line that our party stood until the door was unlocked at six o'clock and inquiring as to whether reservations were full it was explained that a four-top was available, provided an exit by 7:30 when the next party was due...our much delayed order assuring an exit closer to 8:45, a time in which no less than three similar tables still sat empty leading one to wonder why the bar area was still jam packed.Featuring perhaps fifty plates familiar from a visit five years prior, plus seven chalkboard specials from which the Sea Breem duo was selected, it was just after 7:50 when our fist bites hit the table and with silky fish set against bites of wood-fired skin plus an assortment of accoutrements the flavor profile was delicate and nuanced, the follow-up fried chicken exactly the opposite with an overhead smash of flavor beneath light tempura as a light salad beneath served as an admirable foil to the of the bird.Onward to pork, first crispy ear and then supple belly, suffice it to say that both were quite tasty though somewhat unremarkable in a world where both are frequently offered on all sorts of menus but moving onward to the restaurant's signature tofu I will admit that their suggestion of it being the 'best' is not at all hyperbole, the light tempura overlying an airy omelet bathed in dashi singlehandedly reinventing an ingredient generally nowhere near as enthralling as bursting salmon roe and wakami added texture and brine.At this point treated to a fried fish duo in which the yellowtail belly proved a bit dried out and a step in the wrong direction from simply doing it raw it was undoubtedly the second half of the aforementioned breem that stole the show and served in the same broth as the tofu with everything from skin to bones edible quick work was made of the bowl, the follow-up chawanmushi topped with foie gras another umami-laden dish slightly compromised in texture by overcooked liver, though the custard itself was divine.Rounding out the meal with three grilled items, the lamb chop and pork cheek intense with wood and smoke while the duck got lost in the soy, plus a bowl of chilled soba draped in a perfectly poached egg it was only here that the table was informed that the uni dish ordered could not be prepared because the restaurant was 'out of urchin' and opting against desserts as only cheesecake, crème brûlée, and sorbet were offered it was with tea that the night came to a close - the $66 per person tab an admitted deal compared to strip prices, though the overall experience failed to meet the highs offered by some of Las Vegas Boulevard's bests, a bit of a change from 2009 no matter what some may say of the emergence of Spring Mountain Road.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Perhaps an effect of having now eaten at some of the world's best, including places like SAISON where pristine ingredients cooked over an open flame have taken on a whole new degree of creativity and skill, there is little doubt that those visiting Raku are guaranteed to have a good meal yet with so little change on the menu in a city where evolution is the rule it will be some time before I find myself rushing back...at least not until a few more Izakaya are visited to see if there is a more impressive experience to be found.After two more visits to Raku since my last review, it deserves another update.  I'm not going to dive too much into this review because you all already know this place is good, especially if you've read my past reviews.  Service is still top notch and the food is still impeccable.But I will share with you some of the highlights during those two visits.Raku Tofu --  http://bit.ly/1zaxEXbNo matter how many times I order this, I'm always blown away by how creamy Raku's cold tofu is.Juicy Deep Fried Chicken -- http://bit.ly/1p0X6cDThis is not your usual Chicken Karaage.  It's better!  It's literally very juicy and very flavorful along with the crispy skin.Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard -- http://bit.ly/1zayovvAlong with the Raku Tofu, this is still a MUST ORDER and also my personal favorite.Foie Gras Rice Bowl --  http://bit.ly/1kEv43IBig hunk of Foie Gras over rice.  It's a good thing to order if you don't get the custard.Duck with Balsamic Soy --  http://bit.ly/1v66omuI saw this on their Facebook page and it looked and sounded really good.  The duck was cooked nicely.Kobe Beef w/ Wasabi --  http://bit.ly/1zaxRtCTheir Kobe Beef yakitori are always amazing.  And this one of course has a nice kick with the fresh wasabi.Oyako Don --  http://bit.ly/1v666fdIf you've followed my reviews and pics before, you probably know that lately I've been on an Oyako Don hunt.  Raku's is good and filling, but pretty much is the same as the other places I've had it, and that's not a bad thing.Also on a side note, I don't think I've actually mentioned this before in my past reviews, but their toilet is awesome!  -- http://bit.ly/1v65K8oIt has a heated seat and cleaning controls are above the handrail.  It's an experience you have to try!  Seriously!As you can see Raku still delivers and is still my favorite Japanese restaurant of all time.  I was a little worried when Anthony Bourdain taped his show here thinking that the added exposure would make it harder to land a table here but that hasn't been the case with my last pair of visits.  For that I'm glad because for me, a foodie trip to Vegas without Raku would be so incomplete.Awful customer service.   Made a potential 5 star experience turn into 3.  Did not have reservations so we sat at the bar. Didn't realize there was a specials menu until we saw a server carry the black board over to a different guest sitting at the bar.  Someone sat next to us and we kindly asked if they didn't mind scooting down one, as someone else would be joining us.  The server came over upset and rude telling us that we can't do that, even though he was willing to move. She told us that the host needs to know.  When we tried to ask the host he was too busy to care and said he would come back. Within less than 5 min our friend arrived so we stood at the bar waiting. The host did not offer a seat until our friend already walked out the door because of the poor service. The seat he offered was opposite of the guest who was sitting alone. They would really seat us apart from eachother?!  Really was a downer on our evening. And tonight was the one night in 2 years that my friend and I had together. Really stuck up here.  A shame the food was decent. Sashimi salad was good if you are looking for something raw. Yellowtail was good quality fish, but I've had it better prepared elsewhere. The item that stands out the best are Wagyu skewers tender, flavorful, and the fat of it just melts. We ordered all the desserts. The cheesecake was worth getting, light with a chocolate crust. The chef tried to make up for the service. He was much kinder and served us water when the waitress wouldn't come by.  For the price, and experience there was nothing on the menu worth coming back for.  Had it not been for how we were treated there would have been other items I would like to come back and  try. I appreciate great food and don't mind spending to have a good time. To spend that kind of money where they are not kind or accommodating isn't worth it. They put us in a bad mood.Raku is one of those Vegas-exclusive dining experiences every local has to have at least once. I lived here nearly a year and a half and finally found an occasion worthy of a family dinner at Raku. AppetizersRaku's Tofu: worth at least trying, great silky textureKobe Beef Liver Sashimi: there's no getting around the strong liver taste, it's not for everyone. The roasted garlic chips add flavor and texture.Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard: great dish, minimal foie but still very enjoyable. There was also some roe in this that we hadn't expected.Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe: This dish wasn't for me at all. I like poached eggs, and urchin, and roe, but this didn't come together and the egg was closer to raw than poached.Juicy Deep Fried Chicken: an incredible introduction to the wonderful chicken dishes Raku's kitchen puts out, even the spinach garnish was deliciousRice & NoodleGrilled Rice Ball in Broth with Salmon: Great pick. Light broth that tasted more like a tea due to the steeped seaweed in the dish. Rice retains the grilled texture despite being soaked in broth. Salmon surcharge was $3 but piece of fish was the size of a thumb nail, didn't contribute anything to the flavor.RobataChicken Thigh & Chicken Breast Wrapped with Chicken Skin: the chicken robata dishes were my favorites, with a smoky grilled taste and juicy beyond beliefKobe Beef Filet with Wasabi: the beef was good, but I'm not a fan of wasabi so that kind of ruined this for meKobe Beef Tendon: nope. not happening. too adventurous for me.Pork Ear: Tasty with lots of texture. Server recommends their spicy table sauce, which was basically a punch of straight-up pepper. I'd recommend it without.Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce: Ordered two of these knowing I'd love it, and I did. Lacked the gamey taste that turns a lot of people off to duck. Good choice.Tomato with Bacon & Mushroom with Bacon: I'm not generally a bacon fan, but adding a veggie into the mix somehow does it for me. DessertFluffy Cheesecake: I'm not a dessert fan, and found this a bit too cheesy for me, but when you get to the raspberry filling? Oh man, all bets are off. Above meal was under $200 with a carafe of Ashahi ($30) and tip, and enough for three to share happily. Service was just okay, polite and professional but detached and didn't make a connection or any recommendations even when we mentioned it was our first visit. Make sure to take at least one trip to the bathroom, it's beautiful.We made reservations a few days in advance, and staff were awesome about calling us back when they were unable to pick up. Reservations secure your table for 15 minutes (show up on time!), and you get the table for 2 hours. Toward the end of the night (11PM?) people were able to walk-in for bar seats.Another visit to Raku and had another stellar experience at the kitchen bar.  One thing that I tried to do different this time was to order things I've haven't had before.  Even though I've been to Raku five times already, there were still plenty more things on and off their menu that I've yet to try.On to the food.  So pretty much everything except for the last two items were all new dishes for me.Mushoom Salad Complimentary Appetizer -- http://bit.ly/1BCj0L6This was their amuse-bouche for the day.  I love mushrooms so this was a very good way to start off my dinner.Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe -- http://bit.ly/1GYp7JQNot only was this appetizer photogenic, it was really good!  Of course anything with a runny egg is good in my book.  And the uni and roe combo was creamy and surprisingly not too salty.  I'd would definitely order this again!Braised Abalone Special with Dashi Gravy -- http://bit.ly/1ex5NsVThis was off of their specials board.  And I'm glad I ordered it.  I have never had abalone before so this was a new experience for me.  The abalone was grilled, sliced up, and smothered with gravy.  I was thinking that it was going to have a very strong fishy taste, but that wasn't the case.  It was almost like eating a lobster or monkfish where it had a chewy texture and it would take a long time to chew out the flavor which had a lot of umami thanks to the dashi gravy.  Delicious!Grilled Langoustine -- http://bit.ly/1GxVpdaAs I was eating my appetizer, I was peering over to their seafood table behind the bar and saw these amazing looking Langoustines.  I had to have one so immediately ordered it.  It was good!  The Langoustine was grilled to perfection where it was easily removable from the shell and the meat was very tender and flavorful.  It was worth the impulsive splurge.Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce -- http://bit.ly/1I4MPoLI ordered this last time I here and it was still just as good.  The duck was grilled nicely and had a very rich flavor with the Balsamic Soy Sauce.Grilled Foie Gras with Black Garlic and Glazed Soy-based Sauce -- http://bit.ly/1Ncae7DWhat better way to finish my meal off than with a stick of their famous grilled foie gras.  It actually has been a while since I last ordered this so I figured it was worth another go around.  They really don't hold back with the portion size as you can see from the pic.  It's a very generous sized piece of foie gras.  And it was so good.  I love how they include a piece of black garlic to give it a more intense flavor.  I'll be alternating between this and their Foie Gras Steamed Custard from now on.  As much as I'd like to have both as the same time, it'd be better for me to keep them separate since they're equally rich and exquisite.Raku does it again for me with their great service and impressive dishes.  I'm so happy to see that business is still doing well for them.  Reservations are still hard to get here as I found that out from another customer that she made her reservation almost a month in advance.  Hopefully with their recently announced expansion, it'll be much easier to get a reservation and should provide more tables for walk-ins as well.  There's still plenty more for me to try at Raku, so expect another review from me in the near future.FINALLYI have had Raku in my cross hairs for many, many years.  The idea of finding parking in an extremely under sized lot without street parking and waiting outside in the sweltering heat amongst smoking fiends was an absolute deterrent.  But lately my commute schedule forces me to look for restaurants opened pass midnight.  Gambled that a midnight attempt during a Thursday would be in our favor. Good thing I made the call first hand from McCarran and followed up with a reservation.  Without having to wait, we were seated promptly in the first dining room that includes the vista of the bar, kitchen service window and everyone entering the restaurant.  The other half or adjacent room has at least one private room and other seating arrangements plus their single unisex restroom.The two sided menu is cleverly sandwiched in glass and housed in a slot holster at each table.  Majority of the diners are newbies and studiously referencing to their smartphones for eye catching suggestions on Yelp.  Don't be embarrassed. ... we're doing the same too.  There are just too many tempting menu items. We ordered seven items with the Fried Chicken as a last moment add on and eighth and last item.Cold  Dishes:Homemade Tofu - Raku Whole order served with a side of chili garlic sauce and Japanese mustard green ... uniquely Raku's .... dense, slightly cream like experienceWaygu Beef Sashimi with special blended soy sauce (not on menu, by request only) ...  beef eater's dream come trueYellowtail Carpaccio served with special , soy sauce blend topped with yuzu and daikon ... every table orderedPoached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe ...  you will live to be 110 years old ... very popular amongst male dinersHot Dishes:Kurobuta Pork Belly with spinach and mustard on top ... must eat together with all ingredients for total satisfactionSteamed Foie Gras Egg Custard with grilled duck on top ... is your tongue long enough to touch the bottom of your cup ?Juicy Deep Fried Chicken (not on menu, by request only)  ...  assured  a filling and grand experienceRobata Grill Butter Sauteed Scallop ... only dish that failed to stoke my taste buds ... scallop was over cooked and partially chewy and tough.Unfortunately, the very pretty lady reading the chalkboard specials had a very thick Japanese accent and we didn't understand most of what she was attempting to promote. The ambiance is simple and strong, while ceiling pinpoint table lighting greatly assisted in reading the small print on the menu and made food photography a cinch.  All in all it was a very memorable dining experience and essentially fulfillled my expectations of what is deemed refined Japanese cuisine.This is my review #666.4.5 STARSDuring my last trip to Vegas in January, I wanted to try Raku, but I couldn't get a same day reservation. This last trip, I made sure to call ahead and reserve a spot. We had dinner here on Thursday, July 9th at 10pm. We were a party of 5 and shared everything.We all got hot tea: Hoji cha tea ($2.50ea) and a bottle of sake to share: Shichihonyari "seven spears men", junmai nama genshu, prefecture: shiga ($80 bottle). Description of sake from menu: "This is a very drinkable but complex limited released unpasteurized sake has the prototypical sake brewery aroma that is like a wet collection of steamed rice, green grasses, yeast and green apples. A nama that actually tastes like rice, which is a rarity these days." I don't know much about sake, but this was dry enough for me to drink. And I was sold when they said limited release!Specials:*Wagyu sashimi ($20)*Bluefin / Negitoro ($31)*King crab ($20)I loved the wagyu and sashimi! These were my favorites out of the specials. The wagyu melted in my mouth and the sashimi was super fresh. I'd skip the king crab next time as it was just a grilled leg. It was good, but nothing special.Cold dish:*Kobe beef liver sashimi ($9.50)*Yellowtail carpaccio ($12)*Poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe ($9) x2Yellowtail carpaccio is a must! So tender. The uni dish is super rich. I enjoyed the first bite, but it needed something to cut through the richness as I continued eating it. I wasn't a fan of the liver sashimi as raw liver isn't really appealing to me.Hot dish:*Steamed foie gras egg custard ($10) x2*Agedashi fish belly: Hamachi belly ($18), Agadashi belly (+$5)I was in heaven with the steam foie gras custard. Omg! The silky custard with the delicately seared foie?! Sooo good! All flavors I adore. The agedashi fish belly was okay. I thought it wasn't crispy enough and a little mushy. Though I'm not sure if we waited too long to eat it. Sake will do that to you!Robata grill:*Kobe beef outside skirt with garlic ($7.50) x3*Kurobuta pork cheek ($4.25) x3*Duck with balsamic soy sauce ($4.50) x3*Foie gras with glazed soy-based sauce ($17.50) x3For 5 people, 3 skewers per order were perfect. We were here to try a bunch of dishes, so half a skewer allowed for a bite or two of each item. I'm a foie addict, so of course I loved the foie! Seared to perfection. I also loved the pork cheek. Super tender. I also enjoyed the beef and duck. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the skewers they offered. All had a nice smoky flavor and were delicious!Rice/Noodle/Soup:*Cold green tea soba with poached egg ($8.50)This was my least favorite dish. I don't really enjoy cold noodles, so I didn't find this appetizing at all. I think cold noodles are supposed to be refreshing, but I just don't get it. I've enjoyed korean cold noodles from time to time, but they have a nice vinegar and spicy flavor. This didn't have that.Yay, I finally tried Raku! Did it live up to the hype?! Definitely with certain dishes! I adored all the foie, carpaccio, sashimi and skewers. Some missed the mark for me, but I think it was more about taste preference than anything else. I'm a little sad we didn't try any of their tofu as I believe that is one of their specialties. Next time Raku, next time!First, we got a private room off the main dining room which was really awesome.  It was a small room with one table just for us (I believe they have 2 of these).  All of the portions are small but tasty and I got to try a lot of new things, really high quality food with great taste.  Juicy meat, delicious vegetables, so much variety to try!  The tofu is a must.
Pizza a Metro=The BEST Italian food outside of NYC or Italy itself! This place is so unexpected it's amazing. It's a tiny little restaurant at the end of a strip mall located just East of I-17 (look for it on the North side of the road next to a hair salon and Circle K). You cannot let the location fool you... this place is great. I heard it rumored that the owner was an executive chef at some foo-foo place in Scottsdale that had creative differences with the management, so he left to open his own place. I didn't have the courage to ask him, but he is straight out of Napoli and the food is fresh and exciting.I took two friends and we literally were fighting over who had the better food. It was so good that we had each picked out at least four more entrees that we wanted to come back for and were scheduling out visits to accommodate a goal to try every single item! I mean seriously there was no table talk or chit chat... all we talked about was the food.Pizza A Metro only has a handful of tables, but when you walk in the door they start baking the most amazing Italian Flat Bread in their wood brick oven. It's served with a cold side of sauteed onions, eggplant, black olives and capers. The topping is good enough to eat straight out of the bowl and the bread is tender and hot. We ended our meal with a serving of homemade Tiramisu that was so orgasmically good, you could literally spread it over your naked body, lick it off and call it a night!In addition to an extensive menu, they have two specials that change daily. Entrees are moderately priced between 7.95 and 8.95, the pastas are homemade and many can be interchanged with the various sauces or toppings of your liking. In addition to the pasta and meat selections they have an assortment of soups/salads/starters and several pizzas/calzones. Portions are large and filling (for example the "Metro" sized pizza is literally 39 inches across - seriously the guy showed me!).For all you CenPho folks, they deliver from 35th Ave to Central and Camelback to Buckeye. They are open Monday - Thursday from 11:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Friday - Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.The only downside that I could find (other than the limited table space) was that they don't serve liquor. But they do encourage b.y.o. and will cork it for you table-side.This is the kind of place that Yelp was designed for. A local hole in the wall that serves mind blowing food and no one knows about. Please please please visit this place because it's only six blocks from my house and now that I know they are there I can't imagine them going out of business.  : )06/05/2008 Update: Okay I officially have a problem because I have now eaten at this place 5 times in the last two weeks, have sampled about 60% of their menu and am convinced that when introducing myself it should go something like this: "Hi my name is Julie and I am a Pizza A Metro addict." Are there any 12 step groups for a restaurant junkie???Pizza a Metro? A better name would be "Italian Nirvana." if you ask me. Everything Hubby and I had last night was outrageously delicious, super fresh, and very reasonably priced. The owner, Maurizio, is as charming and warm as his first tiny restaurant.We started with a Caprese salad, with a beautiful house-made mozzarella and wonderful tomatoes, sprinkled with pieces of fresh basil, fresh pepper, and oil and vinegar to add according to our own liking (much appreciated, as I always order dressing on the side, and like to um... taste my salad). Accompanying this was a dish of freshly made flat bread, warm and well-seasoned, it was crispy in parts and chewy in others- all yummy. It came with a relish, but since I learned from Julie P. it had eggplant (I have a serious sensitivity), it was all Hubby's and he loved it.Hubby ordered a small Capricciosa pizza which was the size of a medium at regular pizza places. He nearly wept with joy at how perfect it was- and that there was now a place where I would happily let him "get his pizza on" without any protest. I had the Pollo al Marsala. It was such a large piece of chicken breast I couldn't finish it, and came with plenty of tender mushrooms, and a rich Marsala sauce so good that I kept sopping it up with the few pieces of leftover bread we had. Somehow, Maurizio convinced us to try a dessert, and we chose the cannoli. It was fresh and creamy, dotted with chocolate pieces inside. There was not much chit chat- just inhaling.I mentioned that I was so glad I had heard about Pizza a Metro, and this led to my introducing Maurizio to Yelp. He planned on looking up what we had said that night, and talked about how he was trying to get restaurant reviewers from the Republic and New Times to come, as this was a tough location. If any Yelpers have an "in" at any of the papers, maybe you can suggest a visit to this absolute gem. He used to be at the oft awarded Tutti Santi, but once the word spreads about Pizza a Metro, the "Best Italian" awards will be his instead.I hate to jump on the bandwagon. But dang it, folks are right about this place!We lurked around the front door this morning long enough for Mauricio to invite us in. Pizza A Metro sticks out like a sore thumb in this dirty old stripmall off the 17. It's clean and crisp on the outside, warm and inviting on the inside. Soccer was on the tele, and the kitchen crew was busy prepping for the lunch rush. We sat at one of the granite-topped tables and ordered a few bevvies. FYI, sodas come in 20 oz bottles, so while they are tastier than fountain, they are a bit more money.We started off with a caesar salad. The dressing was spot-on, with just the right amount of anchovy. However it had no croutons, and could use some bigger parm bits.We also enjoyed some really tasty sorta bruschetta things. They appeared to be scraps of pizza crust, accompanied by a sweet onion relish with -- I believe -- eggplant, celery, and a couple of fat capers and olive slices. As an olive-hater, I found this to be a refreshing change from tapenade.Next we had the lasagne and a small pizza with prosciutto, mozz, and arugula. The "small" was HUGE! The crust was kind of on the thin side, and had a delicious chewiness to crustiness ratio. On the downside, I totally got shafted on the arugula. Instead, it was topped with spring mix. Not bad, but the bite of arugula would have been better.The lasagna was delish. The sauce was probably the best part - lots of tomato and basil, and just the right amount of garlic.Sadly, I was too full and tired for dessert. And good news for you Scottsdalians. We were told he's opening another shop up your way.So we're driving home from work today; ready to face the nasty rush hour traffic, when my husband tells me that there's a new place we have to try; Pizza A Metro.  He's a fan of the New Times, and particularly loves to read Savage Love...Hmmm?  He read a review on this relatively new restaurant which had very favorable comments.  Anyway, we LOVE to eat and are willing to go anywhere for good food.  Lucky for us, we work downtown and Pizza A Metro was within minutes.  The question was "should we go home and eat Cocoa Pebbles for dinner or experience, what we would later that evening call "The Best" Italian restaurant in this city?  The question; ridiculous; the choice was obvious.First we entered the tiny strip mall just East of I-17 on Thomas where this teeny little restaurant  sits.  Seriously though, if you blink you might miss it, so keep your eyes peeled.  The restaurant inside was really cute and super clean.  The few tables in the place were granite...nice touch.  Greeting us immediately was the owner, who was so welcoming and highly attentive.   We began our meal with complementary flat bread that was fresh from the brick oven with a side of eggplant componata as a spread.  Both were so incredibly delicious, and truly set the tone for the rest of the meal that was to come.  We had the Calamari Fritti appetizer which was accompanied with the most amazing marinara dipping sauce.  My husband ordered a "small" pizza that's big enough for two people to share: a piping hot, beautiful wood fired pizza crust layered with red sauce, delicious, melty mozzarella, amazing sliced sausage and rapini.  Needless to say, the pizza was out of this world!Ok, so just when I thought it couldn't get any better, I tasted my eggplant Parmesan that came with a side of pasta with marinara .  Honestly, this was sooo good that I thought I was going to cry.  I can't even put into words how delicious this dish was.  I really had to savor every bite and relish in the smooth eggplant that was covered with a blanket of mozzarella and divine marinara.  It was just sinfully good.  This was truly a decadent feast with very reasonable prices.  I even got to practice my Italian with the owner.  If you haven't been, you must go and support this tiny restaurant.  Other than it's weird location, I couldn't find anything wrong with Pizza A Metro, as everything was oh so right.  Buon Apetito!!Fucking GREAT pizza!  This place rivals Cibo for my favorite pizza in town.  I had a cheese and peperoni pie.  The peperoni was spicy but not over riding so. That sauce was very fruity, the crust perfectly crispy yet soft and flexible.   Wow.The restaurant is very small and tucked into a dirty little strip mall but the inside is nice.  If you love pizza I think you'll LOVE this place.  YUM!So curious me, I had to see what all the Yelpabaloo was about (yeah, that's a new Yelp-ism - be sure to jot it down for your next review), and I must admit, this place lived up to the hype for me. It's a little outside my normal dining zone, but since I was downtown with my lil bro seeing a movie at Arizona Center, we decided to stop by on our way home.The vegetarian pizza was delicious. Loaded with fresh veggies, including artichoke hearts, on top of an incredible thin & crispy crust, I just wish I'd ordered a larger size so I'd have more leftovers. Don't get me wrong, the portions are generous, I just wanted more.There's definitely more on the menu than pizza, including pasta and calzones, which, after watching a few being served around me and listening to the oohs and ahhs while they were consumed, I will definitely be ordering next time.The place is small - very small, less than a dozen tables - so I imagine it probably fills up quickly in the evenings. So small in fact that several conversations were restaurant wide - creating quite the communal dining experience - one of which involved Yelp. The owner's a big fan, as several patrons including myself mentioned it as their reason for checking them out.My lil bro's review: "Awesome." The only thing that would have made it better, he said, were video games. Who can argue with that?There it was; cornered with the ratty Circle K that obviously needs the armed gaurd outside. Their sign in comparison was claaaassssy. Once inside you realize this is going to go one of two ways, and obviously based on all previous reviews it went the right way.Our server had classically italian shoes, and Anthony Bourdain hair. Mixed with his jovial european attitude and accent, he was perfectly cool as all get out.I felt like Tony Soprano, if The Sopranos was written by Kevin Smith and the mobsters discussed comic books with their generally bandanad currently little black dressed friend Amanda B.The atmosphere is quaint and the food would help you get over the death of your italian grandmother. The pizza is divine, The imperfect look of the lasagna says this is going to be better than making out with the head cheerleader behind the bleachers in high school (I assume. I talk about comic books so this has never happened to me).The raw beef whatcha call it, while not for everyone, is it for me. Perfectly lemony, perfectly fresh, perfectly refreshing and tasty. The table behind us had brought their own wine, which I will certainly do next time and assume that if there is a corking fee it is resonable.Speaking of reasonable, the prices were incredibly low for the quality of the food. Must have something to do with the heavily gaurded circle k next door.My BFF and I played hookie today to lunch it up. As always the food is out of this world good. In fact, during desert, she actually schooshed me, because she was having a moment with the tiramisu. Normally I wouldn't add this sort of thing to a review, but seriously... she schooshed me! PAM will now be open from noon to 8:30 on Sundays. They are staffing up for the opening of their Scottsdale location and the place is all a buzz. Although you can generally get in with little or no wait during lunch, you would be smart to call ahead or make a reservation for dinner. Also their liquor license is in process, but you can still BYO.Italian was my unofficial and official second major in college. I studied in Rome for three months and Florence for three months and went back several times after to experience the magic all over again. While I was there, I learned many things about Italian culture and solidified my language skills, but as you can imagine, the thing that I found the most exciting and educational was the Italians' relationship with food.  Regardless of the region I was in, I found Italians united by shared beliefs about food preparation and eating, many of which were foreign to me prior to going. As an example, all the Italians I met took it as a given that: salad comes after a meal, not before it; fresh fruit is a dessert, not a snack or breakfast; alfredo sauce and mozzarella sticks are not Italian; alcohol exists to enhance the flavors of food, not to get drunk; and pepperoni is not thin slices of cured pork, but peppers - you know, the vegetables (this one blew my mind the most!). You get the idea. Of course, these guidelines come across to Americans as strict rules. We love our culinary freedom, and that makes sense - we have many different types of food, types of people, and types of lifestyles. Plus, Italian food changed a lot at the hands of the immigrants who came here. However, even if I'm not going to follow every guideline, I took from my experiences in Italy a sense of genuine appreciation for simple, fresh flavors, a desire to slow down and truly enjoy what I'm eating, and a greater awareness of the way that different dietary components come together to create a balanced diet and better internal functioning.Since I got back, I've found few Italian restaurants that really embody these key principles, refusing to dumb down or speed up their food for the American masses. Well, Pizza A Metro is part of that elite category, and I'm thrilled to have found it here in Phoenix, just a short drive from our house. Maurizio makes it his goal to serve his customers fresh, simple, carefully-prepared food that allows the flavors of individual ingredients to shine. I appreciate that so much. We checked the place out for the first time last Friday night. We had made a reservation in advance, which was a great idea because we only had to wait 2-3 minutes to be seated once we arrived. We were promptly greeted by Maurizio and quickly had our drink order taken by the server. I was a little nervous about speaking Italian, since I'm pretty rusty, but I figured I should, since I haven't got many chances to do so in California, where I grew up, or here in Phoenix. So, when Maurizio returned with our bread basket and to take our order, I worked up my courage and ordered in Italian. Even though he was super-busy, Maurizio asked me a few questions back in Italian (where did I study, etc.) and continued to converse with us in Italian throughout the rest of the meal. It was so much fun for me to speak again, especially when the food was so delicious and really took me back to my study abroad time. We decided to start with the grilled calamari and then have the Penne Amatriciana and a medium Pizza Frescolina. The bread basket was phenomenal, with lightly oiled pieces of Italian flatbread with a cold mixture of eggplant, olives, and onions (almost like an Italian ratatouille). When the calamari arrived, we discovered that it was fried and not grilled (both are appetizer options; grilled is more prominent in Italy), but we decided not to say anything and eat it anyway. We were glad we did because it reminded me of the seafood "fritti misti" you get in Italy - just lightly battered with a hint of seasoning. It came with a tomato sauce, but it was delicious with just a squeeze of lemon. Our entrees were even more delicious. My pasta could have been a bit more al dente, probably because most Americans don't eat it that way, but no harm done - I'll just order it that way next time. The sauce was incredible and truly authentic. It perfectly combined fresh tomatoes, tender pieces of pancetta, onion, garlic, and olive oil without being too thick or sweet. The pizza was also to die-for with a thin, flour-brushed crust, small amounts of milky mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and arugula, and salty prosciutto. Just like Italian pies, all the flavors were balanced and no single one was overwhelming. So you know, the medium was huge and even with our huge appetite we ended up taking 3-4 slices home.All in all, we only spent $30 or so and had an amazing, deeply satisfying meal that brought me back to my memorable time in Italy. I absolutely can't wait to go back and try more things (and practice my Italian again!).I need more of this pizza, you hear me, MORE!I have to admit after reading these reviews here, I had higher expectations for this restaurant than probably anywhere else I've been. For the most part, Pizza A Metro lived up to the expectations.  In some ways, it even exceeded.We ordered the gnocchi and whatever pizza had the artichokes on it, and split everything. It was all delicious. The dough has the perfect flavor, and with what other reviews said, it was definitely cooked with tap water. Spend any time in NYC and you will realize that all great pizza is cooked with shitty tap water, and that makes or breaks the pizza. The gnocchi was amazingly light, fluffy, and had a great sauce. I don't care how small a portion it was, it was fucking delicious. Even the bread before the meal was better than I expected, with a delicious mix of eggplant, olives, onions, and good. I counted exactly 20 seats, so this is a b a d place for groups, and it was all but deserted on a monday night. Good for us, we got our food quickly, and had a good time. I ordered a canoli before we left and wolfed that son of a bitch in about 3 seconds. Perfect flavors of amaretto and chocolate. The night went great, and I will definitely go back here plenty of times. One bite of the pizza and I knew it was my new favorite in town. I now go in this order 1. Metro 2. Bianco 3. Cibo 4. NYPD 5. GrazieSo, my friend Angie and I were looking for a casual place to dine on Saturday night, and I suggested we try Pizza a Metro.  I've seen that a lot of fellow Yelpers have gone here, and its recieved quite a few reviews.  So, I call the place to confirm where they are located, and what time they are open until.  A nice gentleman with an Italian accent answered the phone, and was so friendly and helpful!  I loved it!  So, I drive there, and like the gentleman said, he was right off the expressway next to a circle K.  What shocked me at first was a few things.  First, its a tiny little parking lot, and its shared with a circle K.  I found this interesting.  Fortunately, there was parking available, so I waited for my friend to arrive.  The second surprise that I had was just how small this place was.  Interesting.  I guess if you had a larger party (more then 4 people) you would definately NEED to call in a reservation, as its a very limited seating arrangement.When my friend finally arrived, all the seats were taken, and I was greeted by the gentleman with the thick Italian accent.  He told me that it would be about a 7 minute wait, so my friend and I waited outside in the parking lot.   The wait ended up being more about 10 minutes, maybe 15 tops.  Not bad.When we were seated, we really liked the place.  Theres a firebrick oven where people were cooking pizzas.  There was also other workers that you could see preparing other foods.  Somewhat of an open kitchen feel.  the service was great.  I believe this place is owned and operated by this Italian family.  they most be brothers, because periodically throughout the evening, they were speaking in Italian to each other.  I think it really added to the evening, and made the place feel much more authentic.We ended up ordering our food, and even tho I was not extremely hungry, my friend was.   I went with a Cesar Salad, and my friend went with the Cheese Ravioli.  We were given some complimentary appitizers which were bread chunks and red sauce. Tasty!  We both ordered pops, which were brought out and poured for us...but they were from those 20 ounce pop bottles that you would get at a local store...not from a fountian. I found this interesting.Angie really enjoyed her Ravioli, but I felt like my salad was a little soggy.  Sitll edable, just a little to much dressing.  The food here seems to be good, and I think its also the ambiance and guys that run the show that make dining here worthwhile.  I would bring friends or family here who are in from out of town, becuase I think its one of those more authentic experiences.Anyways, the service was wonderful.  Truely a gem, and much more fun and authentic then most places I have been for pizza and pasta lately.I had a really hard time deciding between 4 and 5 and I decided to go with 5 because for the first time in my life, I ate my leftovers  :)First of all, this place is completely unexpected. Being next to a ghetto Circle K in a not-so-good part of town, I was not expecting the high quality of food and service that we received. Needless to say, I was really impressed.We started with the Margharita pizza and I must say, I have not had better. That is surprising because I ate pizza twice in New York in August.  For my entree I had the spaghetti pomodoro. Normally I prefer a capellini pasta with this type of sauce, but I was really impressed. Honestly, I wanted to just sit and smell it all night long!We were so stuffed after the pizza/entree, but Michael insisted (heavily) that we try the tiramisu. It was DIVINE! Normally I would be angry at a server for forcing me to order something I didn't want, but I will excuse him this time.I really like how proud they are that they make everything from scratch, fresh. Even the desserts. I am also excited that they are opening up an additional location in Scottsdale!On a side note, they have REALLY cute plates and bowls!!  :) I cannot believe it took me this long to get to Pizza A Metro, especially since it is the first place I ever bookmarked on Yelp!I will be back. Many, many times!Why is it that the best places are a little hard to find? In a little bit of a sketched out area?Some people call them diamonds in the rough. I would just call them restaurants in phoenix. Sunday I went to Pizza A Metro. I haven't been to this side of town in awhile. I'm CenPho and I hardly ever venture outside my hood. But I keep hearing how great this place is and was feelin some pizza. First thing I noticed when I entered the door...I've seen larger hot dog carts. The atmosphere is super cozy, seating is comfortable and we didn't need to wait long. Already three good things right? Looked over the menu and listened to the daily specials.We opted for the soup of the day, a Caesar salad, some fried calamari and a small pizza.We were not looking to gorge, but definitely wanted to try different things from the menu.Soup of the day was OMG delicious. It was like a frittata in a bowl of soup. Scrambled eggs, spinach, in a chicken broth with sliced meatballs.I almost cleaned the bowl. It was insanely good.Caesar Salad was awesome. Crispy lettuce not overly dressed. A very good salad.The fried calamari was excellent. Not overly fried, lightly battered and golden fried. Not too dark, not too crunchy. Dipping sauce was good, but found just some lemon and they were awesome.We ordered a small pizza and it had artichoke, olives, cheese, ham and it was awesome.After all the rest of the food I ate, just had a few small slices and took the rest home.Everything was wonderful. I give this place 6 stars. But since 5 is the max...deal with it.We took mom there for her b-day tonight. Just a chill evening with good food, nothing pretentious, nothing outlandish, nothing crowded, nothing chain. We loved it. She choose Margarita pizza, Cheese ravioli, Cesar salad. The bread they serve before the meal was amazing.The salad was cold and crisp with a perfect amount of dressing. The Ravioli was the best I have ever had. We even had a surprise Penne Pasta with artichoke and marinara arrive at the table. It was a typo when entering the order. It was really good too. Then for dessert they brought out Creme Brule with a candle!Thanks for the great evening tonight, we loved the food and appreciated the service.You know that episode of Seinfeld where George eats a pastrami sandwich while banging his girlfriend? Well, if he'd been eating Pizza A Metro, I'd totally understand. So. Fucking. Good.My friend and I split the cheese ravioli in a creamy tomato sauce and a pizza with sausage, broccoli and mozzarella for lunch.The ravioli were like little pillows of heaven filled with the silkiest melt-in-your-mouth ricotta I've ever tasted. The pizza had that chewy-crispy crust thing happening, and the tomato sauce was incredible - simple, fresh, still a little pulpy.Everything was homemade. And when I say "everything," I mean they make their own MOZZARELLA, people. Yes, mozzarella. I know how to make a lot of stuff from scratch -- bread, pasta, pastry dough, whatever -- but cheese? I've got no fucking clue. Not only does Pizza A Metro have a clue, but they're so goddamned nice, too. Case in point: After chatting with the owner throughout our meal, he brought out a slice of the tiramisu. No fanfare, no warning. Just set it down and walked away. We practically licked the plate. Go there. You won't be disappointed. But if you see me ordering takeout, just pretend you don't know where I'm headed with it.Great crust, sauce and cheese. Service was good, but it had to be because this place is f'ing tiny so we sat next to the kitchen door and they had to walk by us every 30 seconds.The parts I didn't care for.---No booze, sure you could BYOB, but that's a hassle sometime.---This place has maybe 6 tables, 2 parking spaces, and located next to an oh so romantic Circle K.---We were brought the wrong pizza, (which I started to eat before I noticed) it had sausage and broccoli.  Flavor was good but there was water, NOT OIL, in the center of the pizza.  Obviously the center crust sucked but the rest was very good.---Had some chicken special thingy, good but not 5 star Yelp good.---The Cappricosa (sp?) pizza we ordered arrived it had canned black olives on it, out of the jar artichokes, and basic cubed ham on it. Oh yes, there was water in the center of it too. WTF?We were given a piece of tarimusu because of the mix up, which was great. Thank you.Some of the items I saw come from the kitchen looked really good so I'd go back and maybe get take out or stop in for lunch.So better than average food, but not the best ever.   The location sucks, there is no ambiance at all, and no booze.Three stars from me.   I guess I'm a Cibo kind of guy.We got to introduce 3 "virgins" to the wonders of PaM tonight- and they all agreed it was tremendous and fabulous. The gnocchi was pillowy and perfect, the saltimbocca was tender and rich, the mussels were fat and flavorful, the carbonara was snatched from its orderer and devoured by his girlfriend who loved what she ordered until she tasted his. The bread was great, as always, and the tapenade bowl was scraped clean. The calamari fritti was light and fresh, and one friend exclaimed that the accompanying marinara was the best she'd ever had. Even though they live in East Mesa, they'll be returning for sure. I think those of us who are regulars were concerned when Maurizio left to open Amarone. After all, he was such a big part of the charm and ambiance of the place. Let me tell you, the new GM Michael more than fills his shoes. Charming? You bet. Awesome accent? Check. Kind, accommodating, cool under pressure? Yes, yes, yes. Remembers you and your problems with tomatoes? Always. Tonight, I also brought in a cheesecake I had made for my friend (her favorite, and she now lives out of state) and without missing a beat, Michael offered to put it in the walk-in, even brought it out with candles, then took it back and served it to us on plates he decorated as if it were his own dessert. I was so impressed with his generosity. That's the kind of service and small town feel you get at Pizza a Metro. As long as we live here and the place is open, we'll continue to be regulars.poor execution, no coordination in the kitchen, less than savory ingredients.===What is it about Phoenicians and any pizza not served by Dominos or Pizza Hut? They go gaga for it. They 5-star it. They vote it number one in the nation and it makes Zagat's (clearing throat, then spit).I was excited about this place given all the extremely high reviews and yelp hype; they even have their Yelp window sticker. I arrived without a reservation and my guests and I were seated right away. Service was prompt and the food runner/buser, while very timid, was on the ball refilling our drinks.The thin-crust pizza dough, cut into small pieces for the bread tray was served hot and crispy from the oven, but there was no inspiration, no flavor. The sweet olive salad that accompanied it was the same, sweetened by something, but nothing more. The kitchen needs someone to light the spark, get them to THINK before they just drop the plate for pickup.The caprese salad was beautiful, but arrived with no pepper, no salt, and no olive oil. It was there on the table, but, really? I'm of the camp that the s/p shakers are there for decoration only; the kitchen is supposed to season my order correctly. If the kitchen isn't going to do it, at least offer freshly ground pepper at the table by the server. Is this a do-it-yourself menu?I ordered the grilled calamari salad because I'm tired of breaded-and-fried. Unfortunately the only taste I got from the salad were the flavors from the grill left over from other meat that was "recently" prepared there. I hope recently means just that day, no earlier. No dressing, no tossed-with-anything before plating, zip. Salad mix was straight from the Dole pre-mix bag.The main courses from the kitchen arrived all at once, but we were told the veggie pizza was still on its way. Seven minutes later it arrived, and being polite diners, the rest of us had waited. You guessed it, ours were cold. Lasagna was overcooked and mushy, uninteresting with the gobs of pizza sauce piled on it; I could have done better at the ready-wrap from Fresh and Easy. Cream sauce from the artichoke dish was so rich and thick, it could be called cheese; yuck. The artichokes themselves hadn't been peeled and the outer chewy leaf was still on! The veggie pizza's crust was the same bland bread we had just sampled, its veggies too thickly cut to cook properly, so they were partially raw with cool centers.We were offered a tiramisu as dessert and it was sumptuous.I hope that I get to update this review with a better result next time, but for now, what these cooks need is a good kick in the pants.GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!!Although I have eaten here twice and absolutely loved it, I have been afraid to write a review of it because I'm afraid people won't take it seriously. Because they shouldn't. I gave a four-star review to Pizza Patron. Because I for one love traditionally awful pizza. The sketchier the better. I like it greasy (like my hair) and cheap (like my thrills). I love it when the pepperoni gets those little pools of oil in them and when there's so much topping that it falls off the pie while you're cutting it and you have to pick it out of the box...you know, I think I'm going to stop here before I lose my Elite Status on principle.There's a reason you don't see me waiting in line for Pizzeria Bianco. Because I would just embarrass myself by asking the waitier if my Wise Guy could come with a side of ranch or brown sauce (you call it A-1, like that makes it classier...stfu).The first time Misty and I went to Pizza A Metro, we took my mother. After having just learned that all that underwear in the laundry was actually mine and not my girlfriends, she really needed the cheering up. So we decided to bring her into a sweaty pizzeria and tell her we were engaged.I say sweaty because at the time the air conditioner was broken. They did have some fans up. A whole lot of good a couple of fans did when we were sitting like five paces away from the fucking oven.We ordered a metro-size margherita pizza, which really hampered our yelping because we spent THREE DAYS eating the damn thing. But fuck was it delicious. Here I was trying to find the craziest, fattiest meats to stack onto my pizza and all it takes is some basil and tomatoes to sate my taste buds. The manager was really nice with a dash of eccentric charm. Which is good, because he spent our WHOLE meal standing over us, striking up small talk and asking us our opinions of the food. Yeah man, the food's great. Now if you'll excuse us, I need to call work and tell them I need to take the week off so I can digest your fucking franken-monstrosity of a pizza.Mom enjoyed it too, I think. With all this life-changing news happening around her, I think I could've said to her "I just saved money on my car insurance by switching to Geico" and her eyes would have filled with tears of relief and joy.The second time we went, we brought my brother, the pickiest, most pretentious eater I have ever known.  This is a guy who defends his refusal to try sushi by saying "there are some things I just know I won't like. Like [insert homoerotic sex maneuver]." Yes, I said maneuvers. No go [synonym for "copulate"] yourself.He actually lives down the street from a Pizza Patron and eats it 2x a week. And even HE admitted the pizza was amazing. He didn't care much for the carpaccio, but I did. And this is my review. So whatever.I personally like the intimate space, claustrophobia aside. I'm tired of these reasonably sized restaurants that cater to normal crowds of people. I want massive kitchens that leave little to no room for diners. The smaller the dining area, the higher the likelihood you get to sit by the window. Sit by the window and watch all those other fools, I dunno, do what fools do, like watch MTV and vote against gay rights, I guess. Yeah, phobe, I can see you trampling my rights. You have just been taken off the list for my next party, jerkface.I'm so confident in Pizza A Metro's potential for awesomeness that I'm even going to try something not pizza next time. Gasp. Am I going to violate my "no eating anything not stated in the sign" policy? Yes. This weekend (or January 18, if this ever gets to be ROTD), when I meet with some other yelper(s) for lunch, I will probably order a pasta dish. And maybe a salad. Oh god am I about go through my  "salads only" phase? I am NOT looking forward to this.pizza a metro is decidely good. I don't think there is any disputing that. You'd have to be a stone cold douche to disagree. I would be so bold as to say that their pizza is amongst the top 10 in the valley. I'm not sure of its rank but it'd definitely be up there in my list.I dropped in last night after class with a rumbling belly and craving some good pizza, I'd read some of it's reviews a while back, and realized it was on thomas, essentially down the street from PC. Pizza A Metro is the definition of a hole in the wall, easily missed by thoughtless drivers and the uninitiated. Thanks to Yelp and word of mouth it wasnt too epic of a quest to find, however I did lose an elderly bearded companion of mine as we battled a giant demon with a flaming whip and the bridge we were standing on collapsed- after that, it wasnt too difficult to get to.I stepped inside, and immediatly I was struck by how charmingly quaint the interior was. Quaint in this circumstance is a euphemism for small, but since when did bigger mean better? (ladies this is not in reference to me, best believe!)Although a little cramped it is very welcoming and warm inside, you instantly feel at home.I stood awkardly next to a full table of women on a "girls night out" until the owner urged me to wait at a table, he grabbed me some water and then waltzed off to chat with the other patrons. The entire time I was waiting he was chatting with the various tables and assumedly ensuring that everything was to their liking.When my pizza was done, I paid at the counter and was impressed with the pricetag: $9 and some change for a rather large "small" Margherita Pizza. The pizza was phenomenal, and the price tag was appreciated as I just bought an $87 text book.I will def. be back soon.Wow! Another lesson of not judging a book by its cover.  This place is very small, only 2- 4 tops & about 3 - 2 tops. We stopped in around 5pm & there was another couple in there, they could tell it was our first time so they were raving about all their favorite items.  Our server came by & started us out with water & some bread.  Their prices were really affordable, the server explained that the smallest size of pizza can actually feed 2 people ($8!) we decided to split a Margherita pizza so we could save room for their Tiramisu.  Our server & the couple dining in told us that everything is made from scratch.  Our pizza came out & it was fabulous! So flavorful & had the perfect amount of crunch & doughy goodness in each bite.  Tiramisu was so fresh & delicious.  Our total came out to $15! We can't wait to come back & try some of their pasta dishes soon. Thank you fellow Yelpers for leading us here!!There's a bit of history with me and this place. Many moons ago, my family was super close to the former owners of this place when it was called Romans pizza. Then my brother and his best friend bought it from them and ran it...to the ground. And that's probably the best thing that ever happened to this place because luckily after that, Pizza A Metro happened. I always passed by this place but I never bothered to stop because the area really creeps me out. Well, after seeing a bunch of my yelp friends check in to here and reading the reviews, I finally decided it was time. This place is a poster child for "don't judge a book by it's cover" because that's what I did and I missed out. When I walked in, it's tiny. But it gives you a warm feeling. I don't know what it is about it. I got the to-go menu and they had their lunch menu which was incredibly cheap! I ordered the small margherita pizza. I asked the girl how small is the small and she told me 12 inches...here I am thinking 8 inches. And it was only $7.95! What a deal! I was stuck between the tirimisu and the creme brûlée. I love both desserts and I love homemade tirimisu even more but the creme brûlée won. I had my dessert before my pizza since I had to wait til it was cooked. The creme brûlée was excellent! It was perfectly creamy and the perfect amount of vanilla flavor.My pizza was ready and I took it with me...I don't usually like to eat in my car but I DEVOURED this pizza before I even made it to school. It wasn't overly salty, had the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. I wish it had more basil but it didn't ruin it. Overall, I was satisfied! I will definitely be back to try the pastas and the tirimisu!
Ice Tango=I'm with Kelly W -My favorite Ice Tango combo is twangy tart with pomegranate and mochi, but the rest of their fresh fruit and other toppings are always tempting as well. I was really sad when the original Ice Tango location closed a few months back, but luckily, I'm not too far from this Hilton Village location.  We decided stop in for our Ice Tango fix last night with our family friends.  I called ahead to make sure they were open (it was Easter Sunday) and sure enough, they were!  Everyone ordered their favorite combinations and we were one happy bunch.Ready for the even more exciting news?  We learned that their Old Town location will be opening really soon!  And the new location will be self-serve if I understand correctly... exciting, yes - dangerous too... especially when I'm really trying to stay on the wedding diet!
Bombay Spice Grill=The second location of Bombay Spice is now open!  It's conveniently located on the north west corner of Tatum and Shea in the Whole Foods/Soma Cafe shopping center.I went with a group of 7 on Tuesday night for dinner and 6 out of 7 of us loved it... sorry again, Marc - I felt awful that we all enjoyed and you did not.  Let me explain:Since I'd been to the 16th street location before, i suggested Bombay Spice to mix things up a bit.  The group I was with are pretty healthy health conscious so I thought they may enjoy Indian food done healthy...We shared the chickpea ceviche as an appetizer and then most of us ordered the different rice bowls as entrees.  We had fun with the variety of sauces too.  Favorite choices included the cauliflower, eggplant, chicken tikka masala, and veggie tofu tikka as well as the mint, hot, and curry sauces.  Unfortunately, Marc is allergic to onions and everything he attempted to order had onions in it.  By the time he placed an order for plain chicken and rice, we were all almost done and the kitchen was slammed and didn't prioritize his order (as they should have).  So, Marc didn't eat.  :(I will return for sure for the food - it's prepared for the health conscious eater and it is not as heavy as traditional Indian Food - I happen to like that!  NOTE: if you are allergic or really hate onions, be careful about ordering so you don't starve like my friend Marc did!I don't consider Bombay Spice an authentic Indian Restaurant; more of a modern and healthier version of the Indian cuisine. I appreciate their healthy take and their vast vegan and gluten free options.I have been to Bombay about five or six times over the course of the last year, and have eaten some of their items at Yelp events. I have never disliked any of the items I have tried, but there have certainly been a few items I found less than flavorful (vegetable lentil soup, cauliflower, spicy veggie curry).Last week I tried the seared tofu, and it was absolutely amazing. It is an appetizer, but comes with five or six good sized slices of tofu, and I would eat it as a meal. I also fell in love with the DELICIOUS tofu masala. I couldn't be happier with either of those selections and highly recommend them. I also like that you get to choose two menu items and have it served in a variety of ways (plated with rice, lettuce wraps, roti taco, etc). It gives a little extra variety depending on your mood. One complaint I have is that they do not know which wines are vegan. To have a separate menu focusing on vegan entrees and to not know what complimentary drinks are also vegan leaves me a little dissatisfied.Overall, Bombay has good service, a good location next to Whole Foods, progressive menu items, is moderately priced, and has a good variety of items available for vegans and carnivores alike.
WikiWiki Hawaiian Grill=Fans of the dramatic misfortunate adventures of RyanC read on...WikiWiki, whose name creates instant old school rap flashbacks*, catered the recent Tiki Party PBR Concert featuring Fishbone and other cool local acts.The grilled meat smelled good (although when does grilled meat not) so I stepped up to their little table setup and surveyed a grill full of what looked like flattened chicken thighs and their menu sign which offered a limited selection from their regular menu: $5 Chicken $7 Beef Short Ribsor $7 Meat Combo-all with white rice and macaroni salad.I ordered the combo.  A few moments later I opened up the styrofoam clamshell the Young Male (YM) staffer handed me.  I'd gotten all rice,and there were in fact two small icecream scooper mounds of glutenous grain, but slapped on top of it was one small piece of chicken, perhaps one very small or half a large deboned thigh, and one small strip of short rib, which had less meat than a steroid-addict musclebound lunkhead's got in his roomy banana hammock.I extended my hand holding the food back towards him and said "that's all I get?"Making no gesture towards grabbing the tray at all, he replies matter-of-factly, "that 's how much you get."After spending a few moments politely describing the larger portions I've seen everyone else sporting and asking for either more food or a discount, YM refuses.Another patron has arrived and is loose on PBR, so is standing way too close for my personal space comfort, but this means he's heard me and YM talking.  Let's call him Drunken Dirtbag (DDB).  Now, DDB is amused by all of this, but he's also hungry, so he asks YM to rustle him up a Chicken Plate with Mac and rice.  YM doesn't even hesitate, but instantly offers DDB my plate of food, saying "You want to buy this? He doesn't want it anymore so you can just pay him"I've been holding this food in my personal possession for over 5 minutes now, and although i never spit on it or anything, YM doesn't know that!  Is this even something allowed by health laws?DDB chuckles heartily but declines, saying he just wants the $5 chicken plate.  "Me too....now", I contribute.I explain to YM that I will just have to alleviate my feelings of being ripped off by causing him to lose some significant business.  I won't lie or make anything up, I'll just show anyone who steps up to order exactly how much food they can expect for their money, and then they can decide if it's worth it, instead of having to be surprised and disappointed like me.YM: "Go ahead."    Game on, this should be fun.  `,8^ )Actually, it wasn't even working out that well, since more than half of those I showed still wanted to order, but I did get some sympathizers who joined my protest.My friends were also supportive, letting me be, and checking back in on me after several minutes.  I was getting a little tired of holding onto my principals by this point, when OF, sorry that's the Older Female staffer from WikiWiki, came over with 7 single$ fanned out like a hand of cards, excitedly letting me know, "Okay, here.  You can go now.  Seven dollars. Here."  This was not her coming rushing in to save the situation, no, no.  This was a good 15 minutes after my initial order now.  This was her resigning herself to the fact that I wasn't going to go away, and the night was still young.I smiled at her, turned around and set my tray on the table, giving YM a snarkily satisfied smirk, and went back to the festivities, proud and bully-ish feeling at the same time.As far as the restaurant istelf, well, it is run by these grumpy stubborn, non-customer-service oriented folks, apparently so I'm never setting foot in the place, nor ever eating their overpriced, underwhelming food ever again.*yes, my friend Eric and I really did break dance to that song in 5th and 6th grade.Jam on it...Jam on it...Jam, Ja-J-J-J-J-Jam on it!
The Dhaba=Now with so many good things going for it, I did leave The Dhaba slightly indifferent. You see when I order and eat, I'm pretty much a total top. While I am open to suggestion, I have a good idea of what I want and how I want it. During my visit, not only was I flipped but I didn't have much say in the matter. Please don't get me wrong, our server was friendly however, every time when one of us ordered something, he would tell us that he would order something better for us to enjoy. For me, I was dead set on ordering several wraps and rolls called Sada Bahar, what I ended up with was far from what I originally envisioned. While I did get my way with a few appetizers, I have to say not only was I pleased with his domineering ordering selections, but would eagerly let him order again for me.Street food called chaat, is to Indian cooking as dim sum is to Chinese. Usually a small plate with around 3 servings varying in preparation, and with enough variety to make a meal out of. Starting with the Amritsri Samosa Chaat ($6); these are a deep fried triangular dumpling filled with a mixture of potatoes, onions and chili, served with a spicy yogurt sauce. Perfectly crunchy and not a drop of oil, just breaking into one of them was a delight as the fragerent steam escaped, it was aromatherapy Indian style.Ambala Tiki Chaat ($6) was more of a composed small plate. A couple of potato pancakes, layered with garbanzo beans, onions, and garnished with fresh mint & tamarind chutney and yogurt. The flavor components with Indian cooking are generally very complex, this plate was a great example of complexity and harmony. Each bite had varying degrees of spicy and sweet then a slightly sour finish from the chutney.Complexity doesn't quite work like with the Kolkata Pani Puri ($6). These are round hollows, fried crisp and served with a watery mixture of tamarind, chili and potatoes. The idea is to spoon in some of the mixture into each puri, then pop into your mouth. While the texture was nice, the flavors just never came together and ended up just tasting weird.This is the part where he took over and assured us what he was ordering was going to be quite good. As the dishes came out we weren't quite sure what was what, so we just dug in. Eventually we got clarity and just continued to share, family style.Arriving on a sizzling iron skillet covered with peppers and onions, the Chicken Tikka Kabob ($11) was not only a dramatic presentation coming from the kitchen, but the colors were vivid and bright. Large pieces of boneless/skinless chicken breast are rubbed with spices then grilled, resulting in a beautiful yellow color. The chicken was tender and moist yet had a slight smokiness that added another welcome dimension.Served in a large basket were piles of hot freshly baked naan ($3 per order). The thick and tender bread was a welcome site since I was wanting a wrap to begin with. Plain, garlic and chili each flavor welcomes dipping, wrapping and scooping of sauces and meats.Loving yogurt, the creamy tang of the Kashmiri Chicken Tikka Masala ($10) was a welcome surprise. This is where the naan really came into play by making good use of the tender pieces of chicken and yogurt sauce. Sopping up as much of the delicious sauce as I could, interactivity is just part of the experience.With so many different spices and spiciness, the Mango Lassi ($3) was as welcome as the rain. Yogurt and water mixed with sugar and mango was cooling and refreshing. With the addition of a fruit puree on the inside of the glass, made this version different than others Ive tried, though the effect was still the same.At the end of the meal we were brought out a bowl of rice pudding with a scoop of pistachio ice cream. While the sliced dates and papaya were pretty to look at, none of the flavors made much sense together. Complaining aside, this did arrive complimentary. Who knows, maybe for being a good sports?We were also brought out another off menu item, it was a thick, flaky and buttery paratha. Similar to a flour tortilla, this particular version was filled with pureed cherry and sprinkled with anise seeds. After only one taste we were hooked. The group of us made short order of the warm tender layers. You might have to ask for this one to be made special. Our server actually told us how soldiers in the hills of Afghanistan, would make these since it didn't take to many ingredients or tools. He stared blankly out the window as he told the story, perhaps of his own personal experience building make shift clay ovens?Alright, so sometimes letting go can be a hard thing to do. After this experience, its actually kind of nice sitting back and enjoying the surprises the kitchen has in store.pretty scrumptious.we had so much food it was nuts. my friend had a restaurants.com coupon so we went to town. we ordered the takki nakki (jk i dont remember the name) it was potato pancake with onions and other amazing things. it was so insanely good...you must get it. it's one of the most recommended things in the yelp reviews and it's a starter so look for it. then we ordered the chicken fritters. they were basically like indian style chicken nuggets. curry and mango served with a garbanzo bean dipping sauce. pretty good.then we ordered the full experience meal. it came with chicken tandoori, indian style fried rice (amazing), chicken or lamb curry, a salad, a dessert (we got one of both and the rice pudding was the way to go) and chai tea.i loved the little crispy thing they served before our meals with sauces. so amazing. we also ordered garlic naan which was amazing. the service was weird. there's a girl who fills up your water but she doesn't answer any questions. you have to wait for the hostess/waitress. she was super sweet but it was slow. once you order, the food comes quickly and there is just so much food. if you like bland food, don't come here you boring white person! jk. kinda. be advernturousI always enjoy a sqaure deal, and today was no exception. Having a shiny new restaurant*com coupon in hand, we made our way out for The Dhaba. I'm not too proud to partake in a coupon here and there. Let's face it, why pay $40 when you can spend $25 after tax and generous tip? Now that's smart shopping.This place was a good decision. We really enjoyed the food, they're in a nice spot right off the light rail, they've got a cool Indian (dot - not feather) market and adjacent shops to check out before, or after, your meal. The Adrak De Panje dish (marinated lamb cooked in the tandoor for those of you who don't know); while tasty, was a bit tougher than I was expecting. They could stand to provide a sharper knife with this item. I was here with my wife and mother-in-law and we all really enjoyed the Nawabi Murg Tikke (marinated chicken cooked in the tandoor).Overall they serve great tasting food and India themed décor. The restaurant dining area echoed on the inside, which made for an interesting experience. We could literally hear what our neighbors were talking about. While they did have music it could have been a bit louder, felt like we could hear every conversation from all the surrounding tables. and I expect that this could have been overcome with ambiance level music or some interior curtains.At one of the shops, we met an interesting and awesome guy behind the counter, my guess is that he's the owner. He told us about different spices and dietary info about different Indian foods. Had a fun evening learning about Indian foods!Happy Yelping Phoenix! .... errr Tempe I guess. ;-)The whole dining experience from the time we walked in to the time we waddled out was FCUing amazing.Sometimes everything works out just right and this was one of those times.The menu is complex and is probably a little daunting if you have not eaten in an Indian restaurant before. If this is your first trip to an Indian restaurant have the waiter or waitress suggest a few dishes for you.We ordered an almost all-meat appetizer that included chicken, shrimp and some peppers and onions. It was a perfect start to a great meal. We paired this with a lovely bottle of Pinot noir that was really smooth and light.We followed this with a mango chicken, goat curry, a spinach dish, garlic naan, basmati rice and raita.The three main dishes complemented each other perfectly. We only ordered the curry at a level six hotness and we could probably have gone to an eight.The owner came out and asked us how everything was and we had a very pleasant chat with him.We were the last people left in the restaurant as it was after 9 pm when we were finishing out chai tea and complimentary rice pudding and doughnuts. One of the best Indian meals I have eaten and definitely a place I will return to.Man.  5/5 stars on yelp stands for "Woohoo! As good as it gets!", and that's exactly how I'll describe my experience at The Dhaba.  Every item we ate was flavorful and unique, the service was spectacular, and the setting, with ornate decorations and cool water goblets, definitely qualifies as a perfect selection for a date or anniversary.  We had the chance to chat with the owner and his family - they're huge on service to the community, and they take care of the nearby metro stop (I believe they even donated the land to build it).  Food-wise, everything was delicious, but I especially recommend the mango chicken curry dish.  Seriously, though, just ask for recommendations and they'll guide you right.Definitely will be back.  This one is going on my "best of Phoenix" list.
Restaurant Les Princesses=I believe that context is really the deciding factor in experiencing a place like Princesses. Located about 15 minutes outside of the downtown core of Montreal, near Olympic stadium, Princesses is a greasy spoon style diner that has one unique specialty; two words that are all it takes for my interest to be piqued: "Topless Breakfast". Seems hilarious, right?It's an interesting juxtaposition to say the least. We went just after noon on a Sunday, hungry for our first meal of the day and we were greeted by 3 Waitresses that were, as advertised, topless. There was also one fully dressed man who had a commanding presence and quite the leer about him. I suppose his stink eye is to keep potential trouble makers in check, but still, it's hard to enjoy your eggs and get an eyefull of the scenery when you're getting an eyefull of your own from someone else.This is where context comes into play - It was a lot of nudity for that early in the morning. I was hungry and totally sober, so it was pretty strange. Add to that, the fact that it was the capper to a 3 day weekend celebrating my friend Daniel's last days of Bachlordom. If we had gone to Princesses first thing, I'm sure we could have sat their giggling and pointing like school children when their teacher tells them about puberty, but that late into the weekend, so much had already been seen and done and been done to us, We had sort of been desensitized to it. It was more or less business as usual at our breakfast table. Giddy giggling and knowning glances were replaced with aloof requests for more ketchup. It's sort of like if you had been wearing X-Ray Spex all weekend, after a while you'd just order your coffee refill and not even bat an eye at someones junk as they give it to you.The food itself was passable diner fare. As tasty as they looked, I opted out of the traditional breakfast, and had a burger, which was good, but nothing exceptional. Service was decent, the waitresses were friendly and Coffee was refilled semi-regularly. Also, to Princesses credit, I was impressed that one of our waitresses was still working there despite being visibly pregnant (if, by some chance, she's reading this, and by another chance and isn't actually pregnant - then I am really, really, totally fucking sorry). I don't imagine that would happen at many other establishments where toplessness was a requirement.Overall Princesses was a one of a kind experience. A better name for it might be "Emperor's new diner" (or maybe just "The Emperor's") because nobody seemed to even acknowledge the toplessness. It reminded me of the Toronto-Produced "Naked News" that made a splash on the internet a few years ago. Theres nudity, but once you're there it's not at all the focus. So, if it's the morning and you've got a rumble in your tummy and a hankering for some present albeit understated nudity, this is your spot.
Over Easy=4 stars for the food and prices.  All of their food looks good and some stuff is pretty unique.  I had their homemade corned beef hash with some eggs and rye toast that never came.  My wife had the Pollo Loco omelet which was good as well.  Good stuff and reasonable prices.However, if you enjoy the following, Over Easy is probably the place for you.* a crappy parking situation* a 20 minute wait (which isn't that bad if the place is worth it)* being so crammed in that you are basically sitting on top of the people next to you* being ridiculously hot because they couldn't spring for more/better fans or an outdoor A/C thing (my fault for going in September but tons of people were standing in line to be crammed and hot so I thought I could stick it out)* bad service (god forbid they ask you if everything is ok, if you need anything else, or want a refill on anything but water)Oh and if my server is reading this, I am still waiting on my toast you said, "would be right out".I agree with Laura E, Over Easy is now just Meh!!! What's happened to Over Easy?  HELLO Mr Owners of OE, your service and food have changed since your move and it's not a good change...  We've watched the decline of this little "hole in da wall" breakfast joint that used to be one of the best places to go in the mornings ~ Pre Food Network and Triple D....I can see where your trying to accommodate more people in your new place but COME ON, I was elbowed twice while eating next to strangers beside us!  This is not a comfortable environment for dinning unless you want to get cozy and share your food with strangers...The service was very disappointing, blunderous, and left us wanting.  Our drinks were not maintained and when we had issue concerning our meal our server told us it would be a while before we could get another order of pancakes, without an apology. We had the chicken and waffles, which were ok ~ the chicken was nice and crisp but was a little over done. The waffle was flat and plain. We also had pancakes with sides of bacon and sausage. The pancakes were cold for some reason so we wanted to order some fresh but our server was not helpful. The bacon was very good as was the sausage.  We also had the Wolfpack, which was very good with two eggs, bacon and cheese between layers of crisp buttery hashbrownie goodness. Very filling but not something to order if your watching your carb in take. I hope you listen to the Yelpers and make some changes soon.  There are too many other places to dine for breakfast and lunch that are as good if not better than you now.  After all the Food Network foodies have tried your place for the first and last time ~ The Yelpers (regulars) want the old Over Easy service and quality of food back please.The food was good, the vibe was also good. ** Except there was a very unfriendly older lady taking my order. She seemed a bit annoyed and was just not pleasant nor warm.*** However, I will give it a second try at their Frank Lloyd Wright Location soon!!!. Hopefully they'll be a bit more friendly there!!! I've heard wonderful things about this restaurant from co-workers, so I wouldn't want to give up just because I had a not-so delightful first impression.  :)Can someone please tell me why people go here???Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed, probably because it's a holiday week.That doesn't excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldn't take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes.Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didn't seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now aren't even good enough to brag about.I'm sure if the service had been better, I wouldn't be so miserable right now. My food coma isn't satisfying. I will *never* go here again. Ever. I felt stupid leaving a tip, it was THAT bad. Total. Fail. Blech.Tried to Visit this establishment. Was a 5 to ten minute wait. No problem. Grabbed a iced coffee, it is 100 degrees outside. Grabbed a paper - sitting outside waiting. First impression. Greater tells me to drink up or throw away the iced coffee. Seriously. I bought this to survive waiting on your Resturant. The server says owner policy. It's two sips off a iced coffee, but what a crazy rule. So I ask to speak to the owner, literally seated yards away - "he's in a meeting", so they go get the manager. Still have not stepped foot in the Resturant. Still outside. Lovely Arizona hospitality!!! No manager arrives. Eventually I give up. Go down to the right and visit The Black Cat Coffee house. What a difference. I have my food in front of me, the staff are great. I got in first try. Avoid the over easy. Stick to black catWORST EXPERIENCE EVER!Let me get this straight, I LOVE the Gilbert location. The Phoenix experience was hands down the worst of my life. I never made it into the restaurant to eat because the hostess was SO rude. I actually told her "I feel like I am inconveniencing you - should I take my business elsewhere?" she replied "look around, it is packed, we don't need your business". I explained that I brought a group of friends (6 total) to the restaurant because I love the Gilbert place so much - the food is great and service spectacular. She told me that "everyone complains about the Gilbert location and says they are snotty, so you much be lying". We went to the Vig instead.I called the Gilbert location to inform them an employee was bad mouthing them. I left my number as well but never heard back.
Golden China=Chinese restaurants are to Avondale what pizza joints are to Peoria; they come included with every strip mall, equipped with generic menus, Pepsi fountains and a seemingly randomly assigned embarrassingly stereotypical name. Golden China is on the opposite corner of 107th & Indian School as Dragon Garden Express and a block west of Wong's. This explains why I never tried it all these years. I just saw it at superfluous.It's like putting Ballpark pizza right by Pullano--oh wait.I usually don't get takeout at night because at Wong's and DGE their dinner entrees come with steamed rice and I can't hang with steamed rice. It's like fried rice without the personality, or Ann Coulter without her Adam's apple.But dammit I needed some sweet and sour pork or kung pao two. There was no negotiating with my appetite. It was Chinese or the other thing I'm always in the mood for: ramen. And I've been trying to cut down on that. At the rate I'm putting all these preservatives in my body, I will live to be 200. And Law and Order will still be on television.So I decided to take a chance on Golden China in hopes they could spare me from the wrath of the steamed rice god.Being too distracted by the superbly cliche interior decorating, I failed to notice the menu posted on the window. So once I got to the counter, I was only able to browse for a few seconds before just randomly selecting whatever sounded good.I ordered the twice cooked pork. While I sat in one of their two-small-for-me-but-what isn't? chairs, one of their staff brought it out to me and handed me a plastic bag that felt a little heavier than normal. When I got home, I found that my standard styrofoam tv takeout tray had come with two small paper bags. One contained the fortune cookies and some hot oil.The other came with a cheese wonton, an eggroll, and a crab puff.While I was delighted to see all the treats my dinner came with, it left me perplexed.If the eggroll is right here, then what's in the third compartment of the takeout tray? Oh please don't be two compartments of fried rice.Be still my beating heart.My dinner came with fried rice AND NOODLES.An entree with noodles? Are you sure you aren't Panda Express?As expected, the pork was amazing. And spicy. Glass of milk spicy. The noodles were soft and slimy, the crab puff was crabtastic, the eggroll was savory and crunchy, not even the bland and unimaginative fried rice could ruin this meal. Looking back, I realize that I am really bad at describing flavors. How did I get to be Elite again?I was so full I thought I would rupture my stomach but I still wanted more.So I went again for lunch the next day.I got the sweet and sour pork. It was hot and juicy, with chunks of pineapple mixed in with the vegetables and tender meat. While not nearly as filling as the dinner experience, it served to stave off my endless hunger for cheap Chinese for a few hours.The takeout is just as good and filling as Wong's dine-in. I can't attest to GC's dining-in experience yet, because every time I've gone there I was the only one in the restaurant, and I have a rule about being at the only occupied table in a restaurant. That happened to me on a date once. It's hard to maintain interesting "getting to know you" conversation while some waiter lurks over you practically begging you with their eyes to give them something to do. Moral of the story: If the zombie apocalypse occurs and it turns out that brains taste like orange chicken, just leave me behind.
Viet-Thai Noodle House=When Viet Thai first opened many moons ago, we went barreling in  one evening and what I remember was it being newly painted, sparse and no alcohol license yet.  So a group of eight, turned around to leave, my mom tells the man, "we come back when you have alcohol."  I thought good lord, let me get this woman out of here!I decided to give it a try yesterday, it looked totally different from my first visit. The two people were working were pleasant and efficient.  I ordered fresh rolls and vermicelli with pork.  There is something very addictive in Vietnamese food, maybe it's the cilantro and mint or the fish sauce, but you can bet, I want to eat there again today.And yes, mama, they do have alcohol, it's safe to return.Viet-Thai... Oh Viet-Thai. First of all, let me explain my 4 Stars. Viet-Thai is a 5-star joint when you compare it to all other Asian restaurants in Charlotte. However, when you compare Viet-Thai to restaurants in other cities (Honolulu, LA, Atlanta/Duluth, etc.), it may fall a little short. LOCATIONSouth Charlotte-ishAMBIENCEComfortable, family-style restaurant. Comfy booths, tables.. I've never felt uncomfortable wearing shorts and a t-shirt here. If you're looking for an upscale meal for an uppity date, this is definitely not the place for you. if you've been dating a girl/guy for 2+ years and you're comfortable eating a ton of good food and maybe leaving a little pudgier than when you first walked in, this is the place for you! The waitresses are more than accommodating. If you go there often enough (like I do), mama-san starts to recognize you and brings you extra food items even before you ask (such as pho soup on the side or extra peanut sauce). Despite the non-uppity nature of this restaurant, be forewarned that the prices are a bit steep.FOODI like Asian food. I think that Charlotte is really lacking in this arena. SERIOUSLY LACKING. I also think that Charlotte folks don't really know Asian food.. but that's really besides the point. (but seriously, come on. Cowfish is not a great restaurant. why do you guys keep going there for sushi???) Anyway, what is important is that I am a return customer at Viet-Thai. That says a lot for this little place in Charlotte. Viet-Thai is a funky, fusion-ish restaurant. My theory is that the owners are a husband-wife combo who decided to merge their ethnic backgrounds to create this restaurant. (Let me be clear peeps... Restaurants that have "multi-Asian" cuisine should be thought of as wonky.)Viet-Thai is the place we go to when we need our pho or pad thai fix for the week. It's pretty darn convenient that I can order both pho and pad thai at once. Again, come here with someone you're comfortable chowing down with. Summer Rolls (not fried)Their *huge* summer rolls are delicious but definitely not what you'd expect from a Vietnamese joint. They use a little bit of cabbage and some other greens that typically don't get rolled into the summer roll. Their peanut sauce is also a little different than other places. It's pretty runny and heavy on the peanut butter rather than hoisin. PhoTheir pho has always been on point. It isn't greasy and definitely doesn't lack in flavor. Their broth has a significant amount of cilantro flavoring though-- so for those of you who don't appreciate herbal deliciousness, you may want to stay away from pho. Mi Mi... I was recently introduced to this dish by my Vietnamese friend, Tommy in an authentic Vietnamese restaurant on Buford Highway. You know that's legit.The mi is pretty delicious. The broth is definitely lighter (in taste and in color) than pho and the seafood flavor is pretty amazing. It has a sweet after taste that's really pleasing.......... But, it's salty. Seriously salty. Pad Thai Their pad thai is great... most of the time. I think that the cook changes depending on the day of the week. On Sundays, the pad thai is ALWAYS ON POINT. Just a little piece of advice. :) The chicken is always tender and there is always tofu in the pad thai no matter what protein you order it with. Note: this is the extreme tamarind type of pad thai. BunBun here is wonderful. I've had shrimp, chicken, pork, beef.. all of the above, you know. Bun at viet-thai is a semi-cold noodle dish that is typically served with greens and a hefty serving of protein. The fish sauce is on point and you really can't go wrong with ordering this dish. If you're in the mood for something a little lighter but still slightly warm and delicious, this is the dish for you.
Elio Pizzeria=Un grand classique du quartier. La nourriture goûte souvent comme à la casa di nonna le dimanche après-midi. Je dis souvent, parce que des fois le goût n'y est pas, il manque de quelque chose. Le midi par exemple c'est moins bon, plus gras que d'habitude. Mais c'est quand même meilleur que ben d'autres resto italien. On y va dans un esprit de partage, les portions sont généreuses, tellement abordables et il faut gouter à plusieurs plats. La pizza à la roquette et la salade maison peuplent mes rêves parfois, c'est comme un bec en pincette de grand-maman italienne, doux, réconfortant pis un peu piquant!
Red Velvet Cafe=Stopped by for lunch with a fellow Yelper the other day.  Heard this was an organic healthy, Vegan & Vegetarian hangout.....that also served the Carnivores, so I was eager to give it a try and see what it feels like to be a Vegan in a Steakhouse (since I'm a Carnivore).  This was one of the most difficult reviews for me to write.  This place has so much potential.....I wish there was a 1/2 Star system because I want to give it 3.5 Stars and was on the fence for 3 or 4 Stars, here's why:The menu is pretty extensive and has a lot of items that pique'd my interest, such as: Grilled Chicken Soft Tacos ($12.95), Buffalo Chicken Wrap ($7.99), Pepperoni Pizzetta ($8.95)....wait, what's a Pizzetta?  Turns out it's a Pizza.....come on, enough with the goofy names already, just call it a Pizza and call it a day!  A lot of stuff looked good and I was surprised at the number of items available for Carnivores....I ended up ordering their Fire Fries (Baked Fries topped with Hot Sauce, Pico de Gallo, Mozzarella & Cheddar Cheese $7) and a Chicken Panini (w/Buffalo Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil with Pesto $7.95).  The server asked if I wanted the Vegan Cheese on the Fire Fries....I passed and wanted the full monty.To wash it down, I had some Iced Tea ($2.50)....which was awesome BTW.The service was a bit slow.  It took some time for the waiter to take our order and the table next to us had to stop a busperson to get their order taken too.  It was 11:30 am and the lunch rush hadn't started yet, so I don't know what the issue was.  Anyway, it wasn't too bad but was borderline annoying.....another few minutes and it would have cost them a Star.Our food came out after a short wait and I was surprised to see how HUGE the Fire Fries were!  I thought this was suppose to be a "healthy" restaurant?!  LOL  For a minute I thought I was in Claim Jumper!  The Fries look too good, so I attacked them first.  The top layer of Fire Fries were awesome....baked well and had good flavor.  However.....the middle and bottom portion of the Fries were undercooked and semi-raw, not good.  Also, the cook didn't spread the ingredients throughout the dish.....the Hot Sauce and Pico de Gallo was only in one corner of the dish, buried under the top layer of Cheese.  The other 3/4 of the dish was only melted Cheese and the Fries.  This was a damn shame because the portion with all of the ingredients was awesome!  The rest of it was just so/so.  He/she needs a lesson in making a consistent dish.The Chicken Panini was next.....after I took one bite I realized I made a big mistake.  The combination of Fire Fries and the Chicken Panini wasn't good.  The sharp, spicy flavor of the Fire Fries overwhelmed my taste buds so when I ate my Chicken Panini it tasted bland.  This is not the restaurant's fault, but mine.  So my review of the Panini is incomplete.  The side Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette was awesome though.  Another note....the Panini came with Whole Grain Bread as a default....I wasn't given an option for any other type of Bread, but saw other people with Panini's with what appeared to be White Bread....wish I had the choice.Overall, this place has a lot of potential.  That's what made it so difficult for me to rate it....the 1/4 of the Fries that had all of the ingredients and were cooked thoroughly tasted awesome but the raw Potatoes in the middle was a turn off.  For now they get 4 Stars for their Vegan/Vegetarian menu options and the potential of their Fire Fries.Will I return?  I will someday to try a couple more items that intrigued me.My 5-star decision was solely made due to the decadence of the RED VELVET CUPCAKE!!! This is as good as it gets!! I have officially bumped all the cupcake spots down one on my list, haha!WHEN: I have no clue when they open, but I will be sure to ask and update the next time I am there.  The last time I went was on a weekend, and they close doors at 9pm, but they close the kitchen at 8pm, so get there sooner before they close on you!! After 8pm, you can try the desserts that they do have left.WHERE: Located on West Sahara & Buffalo!WHAT: As their menu states, "deliciously healthy"!!! I would come here every single day if it was a little bit closer to me, wahh!! I've noticed that people are discouraged to test this place out as soon as they hear the word VEGAN.  Honestly, I was a bit uneasy myself when I heard they served vegan food, but since I love trying new things, I walked in with an open-heart, open-mind, and an OPEN-TUMMY!FOOD:-mac&cheese: I had to have a spoonful of my mac!! You can never go wrong with mac&cheese, but it was just an okay dish here.  I don't think I'll be ordering it anytime soon.-fire fries: Everyone has their own crazy french fry dish!! This was actually pretty unique!! The fries are baked in pico de gallo and cheese... and when they brought it out and I took my first bite, it was for sure FIRE!-grilled chicken avocado panini: When I took my first bite, I experienced the deliciously healthy part!! It was something different, but it was Yummyyyy!!DESSERT: The only dessert worth tasting and the only one that I have ever tasted was the Vegan Red Velvet Cupcake!! It is gluten-free, no butter, no dairy, no egg (NO ANIMAL PRODUCT AT ALL) & is mouth-watering! I did not know how scrumptious one cupcake could be... UNTIL THIS ONE CAME INTO MY LIFE! The only this I have left to say is.. TRY THE RED VELVET CAKE!! While you're at it, order one for me and send it over! =DWe went here on a Friday night and it was packed!  You might even want to order your desserts ahead of time because it was slim pickings by the time we finished dinner at 7:30pm.  I got a panini with vegetarian turkey, chicken, onion, chipotle sauce and cheese on nine grain bread which was a special for January and it was tremendous.  I'll probably be back before the month is out just to have it again!  The vegetarian taco salad was incredible as well and would make a monstrous yet healthy entree.  I liked how the taco shell wasn't a deep fried tortilla but a baked kinda pita style bowl.  So much awesomeness.  I'm so ready to go back just thinking about it now.  The service was attentive and friendly.  They accidentally switched our sandwich orders and sides but made it right and gave us one free dessert to make up for the mistake.  It wasn't even a big deal.  Talk about above and beyond!  Wow!I was excited to check this place off my list after hearing all the good verbal reviews from friends & colleagues. I wanted to treat my broker to lunch and this was a convenient meeting spot close to our office. Very cute modern decor and a very tempting dessert display when you walk in. Regular seating was full so we sat at one of the high tables.Very extensive menu so will have something for everyone...good when you're not sure how finicky your lunch buddies are. I browsed the menu looking through salads, sandwiches, paninis specials and desserts. I ordered the caprese panini which came on a very hearty 9 grain bread that was satisfying and was served with baked Lays chips (I was also given a salad option)  Basil, tomato & mozzarella nothing special. My broker ordered the avocado & shrimp salad. She said the shrimp was done perfect. Overall I thought our food was ok and this review reflects one meal. For a salad and caprese panini with waters, including tip, bill was $31. Not that good a value in my opinion for an "ok" lunch. But we will be back to give other menu items a try and also indulge in one of their desserts next time. I hear the Vegan chocolate chip cookies are amazing.My friends always try to hype up this place to me, and I'm putting a stop to that now. I finally visited this place yesterday and was sadly disappointed.Being the hip vegan/vegatarian cafe that it was, it was pricey but the food was mediocre. In fact, it's the same shit you can go a couple blocks over and buy at Whole Foods. Me and my friend ordered two different things. She got chicken burger with fries, and I got a panini sandwich witth tomato, we both opted for the vegan options. When we got our order, which took forever, we were brought pretty much the exact same thing, except different bread. The cheese was your standard out-of-the-package Daiya vegan cheese. They didn't try to even melt it down and mix it with some sort of flavoring to boost the choices coinciding with the menu. We had the exact same chicken patty. Again, same thing I make my lunches with to take to work.What's the icing on the cake though, was my friends hamburger bun. It looks like that shit you buy at Wal-Mart, with its yellow poppy seeds and its large cookie cutter shape roundness. It wasn't vegan. I asked the guy at the front what it was and he said it was white-wheat bread, like we were stupid enough to believe that. Because it definitely wasn't.This place just pretty much does your grocery shopping for you then charges you triple the price. Nothing is organic and truly made for you, it's all frozen shit from the supermarket that they pop in the microwave. I wish Vegas would get a REAL vegan/vegetarian cafe, cause this place is pathetic.After the truth on the calorie count of the cookies have come out I have to update my review which I first did in October of '08.  Wow, I had been getting duped for a long time.  This was my go to spot for lunch with friends after a Saturday gym session, and I would often stop by for what I thought were low calorie desserts during the week.  But I cannot support a business that has been lying to their customers since as far back as 2010.  I know only the cookies have been analyzed but that is enough for me to doubt everything else on the menu and how it is prepared.  Thank you, Todd Wilbur and Jane Ann Morrison for revealing the truth about RVC.This review is for both Red Velvet Cafe locations.I'm not saying they don't serve delicious healthy food. I'm not saying their sweets are yummy. They are, for that, I'm giving 2 stars. However, I won't be returning to either locations again.http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/jane-ann-morrison/cookies-might-be-too-good-be-trueTo summarize really quick, this article tells about how people LOVED Red Velvet Cafe's infamous chocolate cookies, which claim to be only 27 calories each. Too good to be true? Yes. A Las Vegas author had these cookies analyzed and found out they were actually 157 calories! So the six-pack of cookies Red Velvet claims to be only 162 calories is actually 942 calories. Read the article and judge for yourself.I've had Red Velvet vegan cakes many times, the ones that are supposed vegan and around 200 calories. As I try to stay fit and eat a sensible diet, I always appreciate establishments who offer vegan healthy alternatives. However, if I find a food I really want it, I'll buy it, sometimes regardless of if it's low-calorie. I'll eat a 900-calorie triple chocolate cake if that's what I really crave, but at least I KNOW how much I'm eating. I know that not all eateries provide their nutritional information on their food. I understand some recipes are kept secret. However, if you are going to be proud to claim how low calorie your delicious chocolate cookies are, they better be true! I just don't appreciate the dishonesty Red Velvet Cafe displayed. People rely on accurate information on what they eat, if that information is available. Now, I cannot trust anything Red Velvet Cafe says about any of their food. Can you? Their food may be delicious, but their actions left a bad taste in my mouth.http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/jane-ann-morrison/cookies-might-be-too-good-be-true I finally have answers to my questions.... I emailed RVC several weeks ago asking for clarification of the peanut butter cookie calorie count. It raised a red flag to me because it didn't seem possible for a peanut butter cookie to only have 27 calories when the label on my jar of peanut butter reads 118 calories per 2 tbsp! (Yes I'm aware of other alternatives... But at the end of the day calories still don't add up... The 3rd party testing seems to back this and be pretty factual!)Maybe we're not all savvy bakers but something just wasn't quite right here! I'm not someone who counts calories or eats by a 'point' system but I do like to know what I'm eating. Like others have said if calories are being hidden, what else is in the food that shouldn't be? http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/jane-ann-morrison/cookies-might-be-too-good-be-trueThe only reason to go here was the excellent low-calorie desserts. It turns out they lied about the calorie content and they are actually high-calorie excellent desserts. Check the stories in the newspaper for more info. I will never go here again.Lost all credibility!We always knew the calorie counts at RVC were too good to be true...and it turns out we were right. The Las Vegas Review Journal recently tested the chocolate chip cookies and found each one had, on average, about 157 calories - nearly 6 times what was advertised!The food was ok, service left something to be desired, but outright lying about calories is deceitful and unethical.Unfortunately, I won't be revisiting RVC in the future.Questionable nutrition info aside, this place is both overpriced and lacking.Service, in a word, sucks: I've walked in repeatedly to their crappy layout and been ignored by multiple staff. You literally walk in and stand right at someone's table staring at them because there's no signage or hostess to let you know to seat yourself, wait, or approach one of the two, unlabeled counters. It's awkward. When a place hypes themselves as being "vegetarian" the menu probably shouldn't include chicken in every other dish. But hey, I understand wanting to appeal to a larger audience- every dish can be "made" vegetarian/vegan using tofu. Which is questionably nutritious, as it's processed soy, but hey...Much like the nearby Panini Café, this place somehow expects you to find it reasonable to spend $16 on a sandwich. I don't know about you, but I'd rather hit up the Strip for a gourmet burger from a celebrity chef if I'm going to pay that. And no, using organic ingredients doesn't justify it.Tried the veggie Panini and the chicken pesto Panini- pesto was missing but even with it, I'm not sure the flavor would have been saved. Everything inside the sandwich is overpowered by the bread. And not in a good way.This place is hyped as both "vegetarian"/vegan and "healthy", and "organic" with little to the menu offerings that actually fit the criteria, which trumps the fact that they make half-decent desserts.
Red Robin Gourmet Burgers=This is the first time I have ever been here.  I really liked it. We had a great waiter, but then he was cut and we got a replacement. Though she also was very good.Our Burgers were fantastic! Cooked fully well and very fresh.Also, our waiter brewed a fresh pot of coffee for me.Endless fries as well, can you believe that.They also have this great new program, a royalty program. Sign me up I can't wait  . A free Burger the month of your Birthday and for every 9 burgers you get your 10th free. Clean bathrooms,as I went in there to wash my hands before we ate.They have a TV in the Floor near the waiting area,which I have never seen before. I thought it was really Cool!We have been to this place a few times now.  So it is safe to say I really like it!Endless fries for starters, then really good Burgers. So worth the trip.They even send you emails about all the great deals that they have going on.The thing I really like about that is you do not have to print coupons they have it all downloaded on your rewards card.So I think they really care more about the environment with that because, no ink and no paper wasted. A really good Idea!Staff is always friendly and nice,even when you call on the phone.The place is clean and the food is good.They even made me nice fresh coffee the other day.My most fun part here is the TV in the floor, I am really amused by that.Clean bathrooms and lots of parking.So this was my first time eating at Red Robin ever..... yes I said ever...... I was really excited to see that they had a mushroom burger on their menu! Not a lot of places have mushroom burgers so I was super excited to try it. When our food came out my burger was cooked to my specifications, but the taste of the burger and the mushrooms was very dull. I felt like there was no flavor or pizazz to the burger. With all the mushrooms, onions and cheese I figured this burger would be making my taste buds jump around. Instead it did the complete opposite. I ate a few bites and decided to just visit with my friend and munch on my fries. My fries were cold and kind of mushy. When I eat french fries, I like them crispy and warm. A lot of my friends love this place, so I will give it another try, just not a very good first impression. Maybe if I order something else I will have better luck! I usually try to give new places more than one shot just on that occasional off day we all have every now and then. :)Mom wanted a Burger for lunch, so we decided to head to Red Robin.  It's in our neighborhood and it's been a while since we were last here.   We like this place because of the variety of Burgers they have on the menu.  It's pretty extensive and creative.  The Bleu Ribbon Burger (Bleu Cheese, Chipotle Mayo, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion Strings, Onion Bun), $9.79 immediately jumped out at me when I browsed the menu, so I went for it.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jBs2HmEOkqCvdHNnw3N-og?select=LX8XzvXLi__N_8hn2EPUdQMom went for a Turkey Burger....she's been on a Turkey Burger kick lately.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jBs2HmEOkqCvdHNnw3N-og?select=zD0Th0NI9ydO5MA2DogVmgThe service was excellent, as usual, and the food came out quickly.  We requested our Burgers to be cut in half and they got it right.  I took one bite out of my Bleu Ribbon Burger and instantly became a fan....yum!  The Bleu Cheese and Onion Straws gave the Burger a unique flavor that tasted soooo good.  It left me wanting more when I was finished....which is the tell-tale sign for me that I enjoyed the grub.Overall, the experience was very good.Return Factor - 90%Sing it with me......REEED ROBIN.....YUM! ;)Oohhh my goodness....my brain can't think because it is SOO LOUD IN HERE!  Now I remember why back in the days I would bring my baby here.  Because no matter how loud she screams no one notices. LOL  I think its so loud that you actually have to yell to communicate with the person you are with so its all an ugly vicious cycle. Sunday afternoon we decided on a burger-lunch and thought it had been so long since we had been here.  Now we remember why. hahah The waiting area was full but must have been for a large party because our party of 2 got seated right away.  Every seat in this place was full.  Tons of large parties full of families and friends!  Maybe the after-church crowds as well.  So much I forgot about this place-not a frequent favorite just for the fact there aren't too many healthy options here.  If you can control yourself they do serve salads.  I'm just not sure how healthy they are since I'm not the one who can order salad with a menu that has fantastic pictures enticing your blurred and echoing thinking.  We were literally seated for less than 5 minutes when our waitress came to apologize for the wait.  Wait?  What wait?  Very nice girl but a little ditsy.  I don't generally go for burgers anywhere.  I usually opt for the grilled chicken for a healthier choice.  Today I was going all out.  Here's what we ordered:Whisky BBQ burger - slightly greasy bun, topped with a juicy on the inside burger with crispy onion strings and a smoky bbq sauce.  Yes I didn't go for the lowest in calorie/fat option.  It was pretty great though.  I had to cut it in fourths so I could actually eat it in a nice non-messy way.  My once a year indulgence didn't fail me...er-until just now.....SHOW STOPPER....  Might I say how disgusted I am now that I looked at the nutritional value of this burger....Oh my freakin gawd......1138 calories 70 grams of fat!  HOLY SHIT!  My hour workout that night didn't even put a dent in that!  (not even funny right now) Sniff sniff.....Tear.to continue....BF ordered a regular cheese burger with mustard and crispy onion strings.  He said it was the best he's had in a long time.  He ordered a side of coleslaw and loved it.....and don't forget the "bottomless steakfries"...its what they advertise on TV.  ...and I am not even looking at the nutritional value of these! God help me here!  I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of steak fries but I ate a few anyway.  I've seen other reviews about the seasoning on the tables.  Nothing (at all) special to me.  The fries are dry anyway and the seasoning doesn't even stick.  So "eh" on the fries. Maybe I will substitute them next time-FOR SALAD (disgusted still).  BTW we didn't need bottomless as there were plenty that we didn't finish....Thank God!Customer service is outstanding.  The manager checked on our table several times.  Drinks never ran low and our server was super attentive in the midst of her many other tables.  I am often amazed when someone can juggle all that and still be pleasant and attentive.  I know.  Yes agreed...that's how it should be.Overall the place is fun, loud and perfect to bring your really boisterous family and friends to clog their arteries!  Enjoy THAT would ya!  =)THIS RED ROBIN FLIES ABOVE 3.5 STARS   The Red Robin came to life in Seattle many years ago in 1969 as a gourmet burger restaurant. From that one restaurant, the Red Robin has flown across the American and Canadian landscape landing in several cities to take the casual dining customer under its wings. From the Pacific to the Atlantic, Red Robin has treated customers to an upbeat casual dining experience featuring a menu of gourmet burgers, specialty sandwiches, appetizing adult beverages, and dessert. In recent times, the Red Robin is soaring above some of its competition with thier bottomless fries.   Over twenty years have flown by since I last visited the Red Robin back in New York. I remember enjoying the food, but Long Islanders at the time did not take to the Red Robin causing it to relinquish it's space in the Smith Haven Mall to TGI Friday's. Twenty years later and last week, my brother and I were walking around the new-sprung Downtown Summerlin and took notice that a Red Robin is arriving the second week of November. So, yesterday after my brother and I left Floyd Lamb State Park (or Tulle Springs), it was in the top of my mind to have dinner in the Centennial Center Red Robin. And that is what we did.   When we walked into the relatively large waiting room, the attentive hostess let us know that there was a booth or table in the lounge, which is one of the two rooms in the restaurant, that she walked us to. The lounge features a bar and two large screen monitors that were at the time of the visit showing the NFL Green Bay verse Chicago game. At 9 P.M. on a Sunday the room was as quiet as a robin.   The pages of the menu displayed several burger sandwiches including the gourmet burger. My mind was set on fish and chips. These days I have been in the mood for fish and chips. Red Robin did not let me down. The three pieces of breaded fish had the right texture and crunch. The fish was the way I like it. I'd squeeze the lemons over the fish before dipping them in tarter sauce. But where was the Cole slaw? If there was that delicious Cole slaw that many restaurants serve with fish and chips, this red robin could of been flying above four stars. Where they scrimped on the Cole slaw, they were generous with the bottomless fries and Coke. Our easygoing waiter Landon was on the eight ball with the fries refills. He was kind enough to give us a portion to take home. The fries exceeded my expectations. In all honesty I thought they would be filler. The Red Robin bottomless fries is both quantity and quality. The fish and chips with bottomless Coke was worth $19 when you add in the upbeat atmosphere and good service.   Just like a red robin, the sky is the limit for the Las Vegas casual dining customer. The fact that I plan to return to Red Robin is testimony that they are doing something right. As I write this, a Red Robin is about to hatch in Downtown Summerlin by mid November. In a few weeks or less, I see a sequal Red Robin dining adventure in their newest location at Downtown Summerlin.
Loco Patron=I am absolutely astounded that this "Mexican Restaurant" has 3 and 1/2 stars on yelp! The only reason why they get a star from me is the bar atmosphere, they have a great bar with good happy hour deals, but that's it. Lets begin with the food, salsa and chips...absolute crap. The salsa tastes like canned crap from a 99 cents store, bland and just CRAP, I can go to Filiberto's across the street and find salsa 10 times better than what's at Loco's. The chips are salty as h***, tastes as if they poured the entire salt shaker into the basket, VERY SALTY, i'm not a goat, but thanks! I've been here for plenty of taco Tuesdays (mainly for the drinks). The tacos run between 1-2 bucks. The dollar tacos are shredded chicken or beef and the 2 dollar ones are shrimp, mahi mahi, and new york steak.I've tried all of the tacos, the shredded chicken and beef always dry and bland, same with the mahi mahi! The only tolerable tacos are the shrimp and new york steak, but once you go to a REAL Mexican restaurant, it makes those tacos look like poop! I've had their chimichanga's, again like another poster said about the beef, they put ground beef instead of shredded like what I expected and it sucked! I refuse to try anything from there again! If I go here it's only for happy hour once in a blue moon, but that's about it. Want to go to a real Mexican Restaurant try Los Taquitos off of 48th st and Elliot and La Canasta in Downtown, those are real Mexican restaurants. You know there is something wrong with a "Mexican Restaurant" when the hamburgers are better than the "Mexican food" they serve. Nuff said.If you need a server.... you can find just about all of them sitting at the bar playing around on their phones. We had the pleasure of having Sierra as our server- whose attitude was just about as piss poor as her service. I ordered a tostada/taco lunch special, so you can imagine my surprise  when a taco and some other slop was placed in front of me. Sierra advised me the mystery item was in fact an enchilada. Ah... it's Mexican food right? Just the same shit put together  slightly different. I told her not to worry, I'd eat it anyway.  I wouldn't have mind as much... but then she proceeded to argue with me that I was wrong because when she took my order she asked me for red or green sauce."Enchiladas are the only item that come with sauce".  Not enough energy to argue with her, she immediately made her way back to the barstool where her phone was again glued to her hand. After about 15 minutes  of having dirty plates just sitting in front  of us, I thought I would do her a favor, head up to the bar with my card and pay. No use in staying  there any longer nor ever coming back. For better food and service I'll visit the Filibertos drive thru across the street.
Scratch Pastries & Bistro=Still haven't had the food here, but I did have an afternoon meeting at Scratch today and the service was attentive and the people that were in and out during the 2 hours I sat there seemed to enjoy their pastries and meals...I came home with a few bags of cookies and my brother and I had them for dessert tonight... they were delicious.  We both especially liked the jasmine flavor.  If nothing else, go to admire how pretty the pastries are and how cute the space is!I'm in  a quandary about Scratch.I walked over there for lunch today...my first time trying out Scratch.The note on the counter said "please be seated" so OK. I sat at the communal table in the middle of the room and waited...and waited...and waited. Ten minutes by my watch. Nobody behind the counter or taking food out looked at me, or acknowledged me. So, I decided I must be doing it wrong. I walked up to the counter to order and was told by the man behind the counter that "no, we wait on you" but he nicely took my order (sandwich and coke), and let me pay (BTW, I included a 20% tip up front, when I paid with my card, so I was trying to be proactive about getting good service...lesson learned) and said they would bring things out.I waited...and I waited...and I waited, while several people came in, seated themselves, were brought place mats, utensils, ice water, and their orders taken and their drink orders brought out. I finally walked back up to the counter and asked to at least get my drink order...profuse apology from the man behind the counter, gave me a bottle of coke which turned out to be frozen solid. Another trip to the counter. By this time you can only smile at the comedy of errors. They finally brought me a place mat and the rest (no, ice water never showed up), and then finally the sandwich.I suppose the sandwich, which was good, on good bread, well made and tasty, is the reason to give Scratch the benefit of the doubt and give them 2 stars (the service was below 1 star).The little salad they serve with the sandwich was fresh and the vinaigrette was tasty, so that was nice as well.Was it $11.00 + tip for a small sandwich good? Well, that is my quandary. I think at that kind of price point, the sandwich needs to be terrific, not just good. And, the service should at least be adequate, and it was nowhere near adequate.So, 2 stars for now, and maybe I will go back and try it again in a few months.Had a hunger itch we needed to scratch, so we ventured here on a late Sunday morning and let me tell you my friends...the itch was scratched...it was scratched feverishly well. Ok, enough metaphorical jib jab...I'll get to the point here...Scratch was wonderful.We went there on a blazing hot Sunday afternoon, looking for a little refuge from the heat...and of course a satisfying late breakfast. It was a little hard to locate at first...there's a lot of construction in the area, so if you aren't paying attention you'll miss it. It's in a really unassuming strip mall-ish location...the strip mall itself is surrounded by all sorts of retirement homes and centers, if you go into the Fry's next door I can almost guarantee that if you're under the age of 50, you'll be one of the youngest people there...so it's a bit odd that this trendy hip bakery/bistro is located here...I certainly can't imagine any retirees feeling too comfortable eating at a place like this (or maybe I just haven't met enough 'hip' older people). We ended up trying a breakfast sandwich (served up on a yummy croissant roll), eggs florentine, a crepe (with sugar and French butter), and a red velvet cupcake to top it all off. Everything was very fresh and had a crisp taste...both the breakfast sandwich and the eggs florentine seemed to focus much more on quality than quantity, which I always appreciate since I don't like huge portions, but would much rather savor a smaller meal...but this being said; be forewarned if you are into big portions, a single menu item here may not fill you up. The crepes were probably my favorite thing we tried...cooked to perfection and filled with some sort of rock sugar which just complimented the crepe with butter really well...it's pretty much a dessert, but I can't help but recommend it as an addition to whatever else you may try here no matter what time of the day it is. Lastly, the red velvet cupcake was just sort of okay. We've yet to find somewhere who can make a cupcake as good as Tammie Coe...but that isn't Scratch's specialty, so I can't fault them too much for it. Overall, Scratch is pretty reasonable for the quality of food you're getting (at least for the breakfast menu we had). This is yet another time when I wondered why anyone in their right mind would go to Denny's or Coco's when you can get fresher, healthier, and much much tastier food at a place like Scratch for about the same price. Makes me wanna go over to one of these chain breakfast places and bitch slap anyone who gives their hard earned money to an inferior product. 4/5.I've officially added this little french morsel to my sandwich rotation. I frequented Scratch when they first opened a couple of years ago but this little hidden cafe had unfortunately fallen off my radar as of late -- until today that is. While out and about on the town, my tummy started to rumble and I decided to take advantage of my iPhone yelp app to possibly find a sandwich spot that might not be top of mind. Scratch showed up and immediately memories came back. So I turned my car around and made a long overdue visit to Scratch. Scratch is an intimately small bakery slightly hidden within a shopping center on Miller and Indian School. But all it takes is one step inside for the character to appear. The space itself is small and relatively bare with minimal furniture, decorations or food on display. But once you glance at the menu and read the options you realize that the food is well thought out and of great quality. During my most recent visit, I opted for the turkey and avocado sandwich but I added Brie. I ordered the sandwich to-go and it was ready within minutes. The sandwich came with a mixed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette and I was ecstatic when I realized that they wrap the sandwich in saran wrap to save it from picking up any moisture from the salad. I wish that every sandwich shop did this because I can't tell you how many times I've had a sandwich with soggy bread because it wasn't separated from the sides. So thank you for that little special treat, Scratch! Moving on to the sandwich quality itself, tres bien is all I can say. The white bread was extremely soft and had obviously been made that day. The avocado was fresh and buttery and the perfect addition to the sandwich. The turkey was sliced and tasty and the sandwich in its entirety was delicious. Simply but delicious, just like the decor at Scratch. The balsamic vinaigrette was quite tasty as well and while the salad was lacking anything else besides two tomatoes, it was still nice to get some greens with the meal. While this was a great sandwich and I've also enjoyed the pastries and beverages from past visits, you do pay for the quality of food you receive. My sandwich alone without a drink or additional side was $10+. In other cities that might be reasonable but for Phoenix, it's definitely on the pricier side when you don't have a drink accompanying the price tag. But like I said, you pay for the quality of food and the quality of the sandwich was worth the $10 out of my wallet. I will just have to vist Scratch for a weekend lunch treat when I want a tasty sandwich.Scratch may have the best french toast I've ever had!  With a little caramelization on the edges and served with fresh berries, it was like breakfast and dessert rolled into one. But such a large portion, even I couldn't finish it, and that's sayin' something if you know me.  Definitely enough for two ladies to share.I was a little confused coming in, but if you're eating in, grab a table and they will take your order.  The pastry case seemed a little empty, but we arrived about 15 minutes after they opened.  Still it surprised me they didn't have any croissants ready.  That's when we decided to order off the menu.Since I didn't try a pastry and it is Scratch Pastries, I'm holding the 5th star until I try one.  I'm thinking an eclair is in my future real soon!5/9/12Was craving for a chocolate croissant for a few days, so I decided to finally try the ones offered here.  Although it was only 2:30 in the afternoon, there weren't many pastries or desserts on hand to choose from... I had my mind set on trying an almond and a chocolate, but Scratch had run out of the former.  There were three chocolate croissants left (as well as a couple of raisins), so I ordered one to go.  Decided to try it before leaving to see if I wanted to get the rest... Needless to say, I left with all three!$2.70 plus tax per choccy croissant.  Didn't have time to try the local coffee.  Perhaps next time, when I plan to come earlier to secure an almondine, or two.I liked how the tables were set up for service- the setting emitted romance already.  Can't wait to try dinner here soon...  Spied three different entremets in the cases, as well as some delicious-looking truffles.
Queens Pizzeria and Cafe=I went here for a poetry reading/concert that a friend who was on tour had booked.  They do slam poetry once a month or something here, great readers.The place itself is totally cute.  Checkerboard floor and chalkboard signage.  The pizza and sandwich selection is ample and mouthwatering.I had an Italian cold cuts sandwich.  Served hot with red peppers and lots of cheese, this sandwich was amazing.  I think what set it off was the bread.  It was so good I knew my friend had to try it, so I traded him my second half for his meatball.  The meatball was also awesome, very saucy, good spices in the balls.The thing about this place which I love, just like Otto's in Tempe, is that it is a family run business, run with love for the people and food he serves.  When I mentioned my liking of the bread he patted a bag of flour and made a point of the fact that it is never frozen, nothing ever is, he makes the dough each day.There is going to be an expanded bakery in back, a cake shop I think.  This place is going to really hum when they have both businesses going.  Mesa is lucky.At the end of the night, the owner was overly appreciative of my friends words and music.  He asked for an encore and bought one of my friends cd's.  What a guy.
Mariscos Sinaloa=So this restaurant has provided me with a story I am sure I will tell over dinner with new friends for the rest of my life.  so, now it is your turn to hear it...I walk into Mariscos Sinaloa on a Wednesday afternoon.  I'm busy.  On this side of town and I whip out my Yelp app to see if I've book marked a place to eat in the area.  Yep, I was a mere few feet from this place.  So, I pull my car into teh parking lot and go in for a quick meal.I order shrimp chipotle and a michalada.  I ALWAYS have the michalada.  So, I'm sitting at my table waiting patiently for my food whilst I read messages on my cell phone.  Suddenly, out of no where I hear a crash and then I instantly feel COLD.  WET and COLD.  Oh yes, a waitress walking by spills an entire tray of waters and beer on me.  I was in complete shock!  Total SHOCK.  I said nothing for what may have seemed like FOREVER as everyone in the resto GASPED to see what my reaction might be.  I quickly check to see if my phone was drenched, it wasn't.  I take a moment to think... did they mess up my nicely coiffed hair?  no, it wasn't... So then I look up and FINALLY break my silence and I tell the waitress..... "Ok, so I guess I"ll be taking my food to go".  They fuss over me and ask if I was ok or hurt and I say no, as I wasn't.  I wasn't even embarrassed by it.  So, I just simply move to the other chair across the table and I reached down and continued to sip on the michalada as I waited for my food.  They comp'ed my order, naturally.  And as I was leaving, the waitress apologized again and I said, "Accidents happen, NO WORRIES!  I'll be back next week"  And so, I did go back the next week with my mom.  For me, this water experience has little to do with the rating.  I enjoyed the shrimp chipotle ALOT, except the shrimp seemed to be overcooked.My mom and I went there on a Sunday.  Packed house.  Oh and the people saying the music is loud in there, are NOT over-exaggerating.  The music was fairly loud.  It comes from a paid juke box, so it won't be like that all the time.I had the camarones diabla and my mom had the molacajete.  neither of us were crazy about our own dishes.  However, we both liked the other's.  The camarrones diabla was the spiciest that I've ever had any place EVER.  My mother likes spicier food than I and she loved it.  I, on the other hand enjoyed the milder flavor of the molacajete.  But all the meat was  a little over cooked to me.  All in all, I don't think I'll be running back here.  there's another Mexican Seafood Restaurant that's not too far from there that I like much better than this.  If you are in the area, you may like to try it out.
The Coffee Conspiracy=If we work together and stay focused we can help small independent coffee houses like this one overthrow the oppressive Starbucks dictatorship.  We can do it.  Drive the extra mile to go to an indy coffee house.  Yell derisive things like "Lemurs!" out the window as you cruise past Starbucks.Watch out for upstart Dunkin' Donuts as well.  The name is a misnomer, they are really in it for the coffee, not the donuts.  I know deep in their heart they hope to rise from a petty potentate and usurp the throne.Overall I liked The Coffee Conspiracy with it's hipster atmosphere and so-laid-back-it's-almost-prone vibe.  And the coffee was good.  Nothing else matters to me about a coffee house if they can't make good coffee.
Java Coast Cafe=Located inside Caesars, Java Coast is basically just a cafe that serves coffee, lattes, pastries, and gelato.  Yes, I said gelato. I couldn't help myself and had a scoop of their Peanut Butter Gelato one evening. I thought that this was a little sweet and pricey, but totally hit the spot when you're craving dessert.  In the morning, Java Coast was our breakfast of choice because it was comped. I had a bagel and an iced Americano, while the GF had some chocolate pastry and a latte. I guess we can't complain because we both finished our breakfast.  All their bagels, breads, donuts, and pastries are in a clear bin where basically serve yourself.  Although, there's tongs for you to grab your breakfast, this isn't the most sanitized way to get breakfast. After paying for our breakfast, I noticed a few people grab their bagels, donuts, and pastries with their hands.  This place should at least have signs stating to use the tongs.  As for their prices, seemed like everything was over-priced. I guess I shouldn't complaint since our meals were comped.Overall, I found Java Coast as "Just A-Ok".
Lucio Ristorante=In a world where Rex Marvin was one run over by two guys dressed as Martha Steward driving a dump truck at a high rate of speed...very little surprises Rex.  Rex has endured "surprises" that would kill a man. Rex was surprised when Kathy Bates jumped out his birthday cake wearing nothing but frosting and nipple clamps. Rex was surprised when he was sold into slavery and forced to pick coffee beans in Ethiopia...not because of the slavery, but because the food was much better than he had anticipated. Rex was surprised when he was covered in blood holding a human head high on gas fumes and giddiness from a Paula Poundstone concert...and the police want to lock HIM up. (Misunderstanding of course, anyone in a Paula Poundstone show is there to kill themselves quickly or slowly...the gentleman next Rex picked quickly.  Rex still considers a wise and wonderful man. Why was Rex there...to develop mental toughness. Sit through 20 minutes without killing yourself, and torture you will surely endure at the hands of 13 year olds with machete's forcing you to pick coffee beans faster will seem like a joke. Rex has handled these surprises and many others with dignity and class. The one surprise that Rex cannot abide...cannot fathom...cannot think of any other adjectives... is how Lucio Ristorante isn't held up to the world as the shining beacon of Italian food in Las Vegas.  Las Vegas is filled with more bad Italian food than a Danish Italian Food Expo Rex once attended in Peoria, Illinois. Those damn Danes will get theirs!  Friggin' fish salters!  They stole my beloved Italian food and then they stole my less than beloved companion, Cyclops Cindy. Old one eye...sweet girl...giving girl...the things she would let you do to that eye should be illegal...Rex thinks they might be...but nothing is too savage and vulgar for a Dane who cooks Italian food in Peoria...trust Rex on that! Rex has spent many years in institutions on the East Coast...and Rex KNOWS great Italian food. Rex know the wonderful experience those beautiful swarthy bastards can create. Rex also knows the pain of a Dane in a fake mustache...and all things in between. Here in Las Vegas there is as many good Italian places to eat as there hookers without kids...NOT MANY!  Lucio's is a find. A city treasure.First...the appetizers. The finest fried Calamari this side of the Atlantic ocean. Brilliantly prepared, perfectly battered and served with a tasty marinara sauce. The Antipasto is also wonderful and the spicy shrimp (Gamberi Fra Diavlo) is simply wonderful.  Perfectly seasoned, not too hot and excellent shrimp. The César salad is a triumph of fine ingredients and the way not to over dress greens. The signature salart is good, but Rex can't stand Gorgonzola, so he isn't a fair judge. Second, the main course...so much to say. So little time. The Risotto, their pride and joy, is TRULY the best in the city. It is impeccably done...slight bite, soft but not too soft...velvety and creamy...it is just wonderful.  Treat yourself...Rex does...to the Truffle or the Scampi. The Truffle is Rex's favorite.  The pasta dishes are all well executed, well seasoned and very generous portions...much like Rex. The Spicy Shrimp (Penne Scampi Fra Diavlo) and the Spaghetti with meatballs (spaghetti con polpettine) are real standouts.   The eggplant parmesan (Melanzane Alla Parmigiana).  The Pollo Sorrentina is a great dish, chicken with prociutto and mushrooms...delicious. One problem happens at desert. The Tiramisu is severly lacking that great espresso bite...almost none to be found anywhere. The Pastiera Napolentana is so well done Rex barely minded the problem with the Tiramisu. The Cannoli's are also wonderful and very authentic.Special mention to the wait staff. Great servers. Very knowledgeable about the food. They want to make your experience a good one. I couldn't be more thrilled with the staff. Rex has never had a bad plate, let alone a bad meal and he has eaten there 20 times. They often have specially on Groupon or other sites, and the 20 bucks for 40 bucks of food might be one of the best deals Rex has ever had. Get on their email list too! Great deals.  In this town of miscreants, low life's, and scumbags...you know...my people...all promising great Italian food...most of the liars or fools...Lucios stands head and shoulders above the rest.  Extremely reasonably priced, well cared for dishes by attentive cooks and extremely friendly wait staff...you can't do better in any food genre.  Much like an elderly Katherine Hepburn said to a young Rex Marvin "you almost broke my hip." Not sure how that fits, Rex just likes to brag.
Arizona Native Frybread=One day I asked my mother if she wanted to go out to lunch. I work about 15 minutes away from her, and in the interest of saving time I told her to recommend a place we could go near her. She said she had a coupon for this place where she'd had fry-bread tacos with her friends a while ago. My inner self said: "Um... fry-bread... taco? That sounds... odd. Fry-bread. Those were the things we ate at school carnivals with honey and powdered sugar right? So... now it's in taco form? Erm... sounds... gassy." What I said to my mother was something like "Ok. Sounds great." Upon going inside the first thing I noticed was that we were the only people in the place who weren't Native Americans. This is a good thing because you can be pretty sure it's authentic, no matter what you order. The menu is short, but hearty. You indeed can get the old sugar covered fry-bread like you had as a kid if you want it. There are also a bunch of other toppings like ice cream, chocolate syrup and cinnamon as well to make your sweet tooth ache if you so desire.In addition to the sweets, they had Navajo Tacos, Apache Tacos, and my personal favorite the Red Chile and Green Chile Meat Tacos. Tribal Burgers as well as Hominy Stew round out the menu. What a great change of pace the food is! I was very pleasantly surprised when I ordered the Green Chile Meat Taco. It's massive. They allow you to order a half size too, but I'm a man right? I gotta eat the full size. The meat is delicious, and the seasoning will wake you up without making you sweat too profusely. Both the Green Chili and the Red Chili are great and very satisfying. Despite my concerns, the slightly sweet fry-bread mixed with the spicy meat was an excellent combination of flavors. If you're looking for something different, but familiar at the same time you owe it to yourself to check this place out. Location-wise it's not in a great area, but serviceable. It's in a strip mall with a big FedEx/Kinko's attached to it and across from a Food City and a 99 cent store. My only gripes are that the menu is kind of sparse and if you go into the place in a suit and tie (my work outfit) you'll get looked at funny. Just dress casual and enjoy.One day, my je'e (mother) and I were wandering around Mesa trying to figure out where in the hell we were. The Navi was on the fritz and we were both getting aggrivated. "I'm not trying to get us lost Cheryl Miranda... I'm trying to find somewhere to eat - I'm hungry!" She shouted at me while nearly sideswiping a car off of Stapley - it was our third near accident that day. "Oh... DUDE! Turn Left at Main - there's a place that has popovers!" (For my non-O'odham yelpers, Popovers is my tribe's nickname for frybread; wah-much-tha is the traditional name for it btw) "POPOVERS!! Hell no! If you want frybread, we'll go home and you can make some!""Awww... come on! It's prolly the only place around here anyway!"So we turned into a rather... dank looking strip mall (aren't they all dank looking?) and my mom nearly slammed into a drive thru sign for a small taquillia who specializes in tortas. We pulled up to a small resturant that was BRIGHTLY painted with Apache Crowndancer and large promises of Apache burgers & Navajo Lamb. When we entered we found a large airy room with a small dining room. Tables and booths to line the windows. There was a cute lil White couple dining on large tacos and huge sodas and a counter where employees took the order. We grabbed a couple of menus and then sat at a booth and looked things over."oh my gosh! haha! the ONLY difference between an Apache burger and a Navajo burger is that an Apache burger has two patties!" I giggled to my mom."Well... Navajos are really skinny." Score one for mom!"the ONLY difference between an Apache taco and a Navajo taco is that one has crushed (think refried) beans and the other doesn't." "oh what in the HELL?!" I exclaimed as I turned the menu and I saw the monstrosity they call a dessert. The "tempting" Indian Dessert... looks - (I'm so sorry to say this) disgusting! I'm sorry! Grandma never EVER put so much on a frybread! It comes with a full sized frybread topped with a HUGE scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate syrup, powdered sugar & cinnamon. It's too much! frybread has such an amazing texture and delicate flavor... it's best when hot and to dump so much STUFF on it and let it get melty and gloopy is - gross. My advice is to stick with the basics and get a LIGHT dusting of sugar OR honey. We were both a little grossed out at the thought of the 'indian dessert' and decided to finally order. I had the red chili taco with whole beans (which cost extra). Normally - at frybread stands, it's called a red chili combo but not here. The madre got a whole bean taco (navajo taco). We started to talk with the employees for a second and it turns out they are pretty friendly. We got our drinks and sat back down. I began to really get a scope of the room. Photographs of Apache Sunrise Ceremonies where plastered on the walls as well as cradleboards and small Navajo rugs. I thought it was cute and I'm glad all the art was authentic. Within a few minutes, an employee came out from the kitchen and brought us our food.The bread was normal sized (umm... I guess large to non-natives?) it had a great texture and was very fresh. I liked the redchili's flavor but was disappointed it wasn't very hot. Their hot sauce was good and I put it on EVERYTHING! My mom liked her taco as well but wished there was more salt. She in turn - then sprinkled half the shaker on our table onto her taco. We wound up ordering another couple of breads one with honey and the other with sugar and enjoyed our light dessert. Overall the food was good. I'm glad the service was quick and friendly and I'm even more grateful that the chili sauces were fresh and flavorful. The bread itself was crisp and light and yet still hearty. It takes a lot of years to develop such technique - I was quite impressed with it.the prices on the other hand... compared to on-reservation stands are astronomical but when compared to powwows and the state fair they are still a little high but when compared to other resturants - they are actually cheap. lol... odd I know. The entree`s are about $7 at the resturant but NOTHING will EVER make me to pay over $3 for ONE single tortilla! That is outrage! it should be $3 for a half dozen, but not for one thick tortilla! To my yelpers, These are real Natives. They are cooking traditional recipes handed down from generations. The bread is good. The dining area isn't anything to write home about. The prices are both decent and highway robbery at the same time.  The cooking facilities and the dining area appear very clean. The burgers and mutton appear to freshly grilled. If you're in the area - give it a try. But do NOT order that damned dessert! I don't wanna hear about one of ya'll slipping into a diabetic coma from eating it.
